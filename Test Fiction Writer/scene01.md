## Scene: First Drive

The sun slants through the windshield, painting a warm glow across the dashboard. The car idles softly, its engine humming like a contented cat. Dad sits in the passenger seat, a calm smile on his face, while his daughter, Lily, grips the steering wheel with a mix of excitement and nerves.

**Dad:** *"Okay, Lily. First things first—check the mirrors."*  
**Lily:** *"Right. (She adjusts the mirrors, eyes widening at the view.)"*  
**Dad:** *"Good. Now, put the car in drive."*  
**Lily:** *"Drive... got it."* (She presses the gear shift.)  
**Dad:** *"Feel the car shift. It’s smooth. Remember, keep your hands at 10 and 2."*  
**Lily:** *"Like this?"* (She positions her hands.)  
**Dad:** *"Exactly."*  

The car moves forward, a gentle thud as the tires kiss the asphalt. Lily’s heart races, but Dad’s voice steadies her.

**Dad:** *"Slowly, just a few miles per hour. Look ahead, not at the road."*  
**Lily:** *"Got it."* (She glances ahead, eyes scanning the lane.)  
**Dad:** *"Now, let’s practice turning. Turn right at the next intersection."*  
**Lily:** *"Right."* (She steers, the car swaying slightly.)  
**Dad:** *"Good. Keep the wheel straight, and don’t over‑steer."*  

A gentle breeze ruffles Lily’s hair as they cruise down the quiet suburban street. The car’s interior feels like a small, safe world where learning and trust coexist.

**Lily:** *"Dad, I think I’m getting the hang of it."*  
**Dad:** *"You’re doing great. Just remember: patience, focus, and a steady hand."*  

The scene ends with the car idling at a stoplight, the father’s encouraging grin reflecting in the rearview mirror, and Lily’s confidence growing with each passing mile.
