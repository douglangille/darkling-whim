## Format Tags

Format describes the **structural form**—how long it is and what shape it takes.

### flash
Tight, focused narratives (typically under 3,000 words) with **one core conflict arc**. Single-scene or single-location focus. Something happens, a reveal lands, a collision occurs. Narrative momentum drives toward a conclusion or payoff. No time jumps or multiple distinct scenes unless they're brief flashbacks serving the main arc.

**Signals:**
- Single POV (or tightly bound dual POV)
- Single location or tight geography
- Single time period (or brief flashbacks)
- One core conflict/revelation
- Narrative momentum toward a payoff
- Word count typically under 3,000

### short-story
Longer, plot-driven narratives (typically 2,500+ words) with **multiple scenes, POV shifts, or significant character development**. Has room for subplot development, time jumps, or character arcs across the story. Structure spans multiple locations or time periods connected by plot.

**Signals:**
- Multiple POV sections or scene breaks (indicated by `---` or POV headers)
- Multiple settings connected by narrative
- Time jumps or flashbacks that advance plot
- Character transformation or meaningful arc
- Subplot or parallel narratives
- Word count typically 2,500+ words

### poetry
Verse in any form (formal, free, experimental, haiku, narrative poem, etc.). Length and complexity vary. Every poem carries a genre tag that describes its tonal/thematic content (horror, fantasy, drama, etc.)

## Genre Tags

Genre describes the **tonal and thematic content**—what drives the emotional register and what the piece is fundamentally about.

### drama
**Relational and intimate stakes.** Character-driven pieces about connection, disconnection, grief, discovery, betrayal, revelation. The emotional core is *how people relate to each other and themselves*. Focus is on the human collision or internal collapse, not on plot-driven spectacle. Includes stories of grief, loss, tender moments, internal transformation, or relationship dynamics.

**Examples:** A widow discovering an old voicemail. Two estranged friends at a funeral. An affair unraveling. A parent watching their child grow distant.

### thriller
**Plot-driven tension, suspense, psychological games, power dynamics.** Stories about *what happens*—conflict, pursuit, revelation, deception, moral dilemmas, high stakes. Action-oriented or psychologically intense. Includes crime, espionage, psychological games, social intrigue, cat-and-mouse scenarios. The tension comes from *external conflict* or *psychological pressure*.

**Examples:** A double agent playing both sides. A character pursued. A betrayal unfolding. A moral choice with teeth.

### horror
**Unsettling, dread-filled, disturbing.** The primary emotional register is fear, revulsion, or existential unease—something is *wrong* in a way that generates discomfort or terror. Includes psychological horror, body horror, existential dread, cosmic horror, gore, or anything that lands with a sense of wrongness.

**Examples:** A transformation. A revelation of something monstrous. Dread building. Body violation. Reality fracturing.

### humour
**Darkly comic, absurdist, playful, funny.** The piece is meant to land with a laugh, a wry smile, or a sense of comedic wrongness, even if the subject matter is serious. Tone is irreverent, comedic, deliberately absurd, or absurdist.

**Examples:** A deadpan narrator in an insane situation. Absurdist logic applied to dark circumstances. Comic timing around tragic events.

### fantasy
**Speculative worlds with magic, impossible elements, alternate realities.** Anything with magic, fantastical creatures, non-Earth worldbuilding, or impossible ingredients at its core. The speculative element is magical or fantastical rather than tech/science-based.

**Examples:** A spell going wrong. A dragon. A parallel world. An enchanted object. A supernatural being.

### scifi
**Speculative fiction grounded in science, technology, or altered physics.** Futures, alternate timelines, technological dilemmas, worlds with different scientific rules. The speculative element is tech or science-based rather than magical.

**Examples:** An AI awakening. A space colony. A technological disaster. Genetic engineering. Time travel mechanics.

## How to Tag New Pieces

### Step 1: Determine Format

Ask yourself:

- **Is this a tight, fast narrative with one arc?** → Flash
- **Does this have multiple scenes, POV shifts, or significant character development?** → Short-story
- **Is this in verse?** → Poetry

### Step 2: Determine Primary Genre

Ask yourself:

- **What is the emotional core?** (How does it make you feel?)
- **What drives the narrative forward?**

Use this decision tree:

**Does it hinge on relational stakes or intimate character moments?** → Drama

**Does it hinge on plot-driven conflict, suspense, or power games?** → Thriller

**Does it hinge on making you feel afraid or unsettled?** → Horror

**Does it hinge on making you laugh or finding the absurd?** → Humour

**Does it involve magic or impossible/fantastical elements?** → Fantasy

**Does it involve science, technology, or speculative physics?** → Scifi

### Step 3: Determine Secondary Genre (Optional)

Ask yourself:

- **Is there genuine tension between two genres?** (e.g., a sci-fi piece that's primarily horror, or a thriller with significant humorous tone)
- **Would a reader miss something important by only knowing the primary genre?**

Only add a second genre if the answer is yes. Most pieces need only one.

**Examples of dual-genre pieces:**
- Horror + Humour: A darkly comic piece about something terrifying
- Sci-fi + Thriller: A technological conflict with high-stakes tension
- Drama + Thriller: A relational piece with plot-driven suspense

### Step 4: Write Tags

Format: `tags: [haley, format-tag, primary-genre, secondary-genre]` (if applicable)

**Examples:**
- `tags: [flash, drama]`
- `tags: [short-story, thriller]`
- `tags: [flash, horror, humour]`
- `tags: [haley, short-story, thriller]` (series tag preserved)
- `tags: [poetry, fantasy]`

## Series Tags

The **haley** tag is a series marker preserved separately. It tracks pieces set in or connected to the Haley universe. Series tags are kept alongside format and genre tags.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Don't confuse execution with genre
A well-written flash piece is still flash, not "literary." Quality of prose is separate from genre classification.

### Don't add genre tags just to hit a quota
One format + one genre is often enough. Only add a second genre if it's essential to understanding the piece.

### Don't force a piece into a genre it doesn't fit
If a piece resists your primary genre choice, you may have the wrong one. Reconsider what actually drives the narrative.

### Don't use "literary" as a catch-all
"Literary" describes execution, not content. Tag by tonal/thematic content instead.

### Don't confuse format with genre
Format is structural (how long, how many scenes). Genre is tonal/thematic (what it's *about* emotionally). They're separate dimensions.

## Why This System Works

This taxonomy mirrors how people naturally browse media (film, streaming, libraries). It's intuitive because it describes *experience*, not literary taxonomy:

- **Format** answers: "How much time do I have to read?"
- **Genre** answers: "What kind of mood/tone am I looking for?"

Visitors can browse by format (I want something quick → flash), then refine by genre (but I want it scary → horror). Both filters matter, and they operate independently.
