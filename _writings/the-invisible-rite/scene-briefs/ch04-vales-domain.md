## Writing Notes

- Establish Vale's warmth and intellectual depth
- Show mentor-student affection without romance (though hints of "what if")
- Vale's POV brief but crucial—reader sees danger Mercer doesn't
- Dialogue: gentle warnings wrapped in academic language
- Visual motif: light through architecture = both clarity and trap
