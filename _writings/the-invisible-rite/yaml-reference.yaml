The_Invisible_Rite:
  Premise_Logline: >
    A conspiracy thriller where an architectural historian discovers that Washington, D.C.
    was designed as a Masonic sigil — a geometric invocation meant to bind reason and faith.
    A populist president's new White House ballroom threatens to complete the ancient pattern,
    awakening a metaphysical system of control. Caught between rival secret orders and his own
    need for truth, Dr. Cal Mercer must decide whether to finish or break the design.
  
  Themes_Questions:
    - Power as architecture: when belief is built into stone, who owns it?
    - Imperfection as freedom; perfection as tyranny.
    - Language, ritual, and bureaucracy as forms of magic.
    - The moral cost of knowledge: contain it, expose it, or let it die.
    - Human vs. system, faith vs. reason, myth vs. governance.
    - Can a republic survive by remaining forever unfinished?

  World_Setting:
    Summary: >
      Washington, D.C. as both a rational capital and living sigil —
      a city-wide geometric invocation built by Masonic founders.
      Beneath its marble order lie tunnels, bunkers, and ritual architecture
      connecting key landmarks (White House, Capitol, Monument, Federal Triangle).
    Layers:
      - Visible_City: public, daylight democracy; rational facade.
      - Hidden_City: tunnels, PEOC, and bureaucratic underworld.
      - Unseen_City: metaphysical echo of the grid; geometry humming beneath.
    Key_Locations:
      - White_House_East_Wing_Ballroom: ritual altar / "People's Hall".
      - PEOC (Presidential_Emergency_Operations_Center): Temple Below.
      - Federal_Triangle: hidden geometric core of the ritual.
      - Mellon_Auditorium: 1935 consecration site; origin point.
      - National_Archives: Covenant node; founding documents as anchors.
      - Continuity_Archives: secret sublevel preserving suppressed knowledge.
      - Lincoln_Memorial / Reflecting_Pool: moral mirror and final setting.
    Temporal_Frame:
      - 1935 prologue (original ritual)
      - Present day 2025 (construction of the Ballroom / Project 2025).

  Tone_Style:
    - Political-architectural thriller with mythic undertone.
    - "Dan Brown meets Le Carré with dry wit and fatalism."
    - Visual palette: marble whites → golds → emergency reds → dawn grey.
    - Voice: close third person; alternating rational precision and lyrical dread.
    - Emotional temperature: curiosity → obsession → grief → quiet acceptance.

  Technology_Magic_Rules:
    - "Magic" is architectural resonance—geometry, sound, and language interacting.
    - Masonic design acts as metaphysical circuitry; speech and ritual can trigger it.
    - Words (logos) and structures (form) share harmonic law.
    - No overt supernatural entities; metaphysics framed as emergent physics or faith-tech.
    - Custodians guard rule: perfection completes the circuit → annihilation.

  Symbols_Motifs:
    - Geometry / Circle & Square: order vs. humanity.
    - Hum / Resonance: voice of the city, sign of activation.
    - Light progression: daylight reason → firelight collapse → dawn renewal.
    - Mirrors / Reflections: doubled loyalties, illusion of transparency.
    - Architecture as prayer: belief made physical.
    - Broken marble / crack: imperfection = survival.
    - Water (Reflecting Pool): truth distorted yet enduring.

  Loose_Ideas_Contradictions:
    - The "hum" ambiguous: metaphysical or mechanical feedback.
    - Custodians' origin—mythic or bureaucratic? intentionally vague.
    - Heritage Order's motives: faith restoration vs. power grab blurred.
    - Democratic Rite's morality questionable; no clean heroes.
    - Reagan's awareness level uncertain; prophetic or manipulated.
    - Scale of destruction in finale flexible—symbolic or literal ruin.
