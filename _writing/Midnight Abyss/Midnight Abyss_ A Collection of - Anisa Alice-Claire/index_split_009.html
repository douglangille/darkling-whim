	<p class="block"> </p>
	<p class="block"> </p>
	<p class="block21">Shaun Adams lives and works on the Isle of Wight. He has turned his hand to different things over the years including a short stint as a gravedigger. Writing is his passion and he indulges it whenever time allows, which is not as often as he’d like. Shaun has self-published two short story collections and been published in several magazines both online and in print.  He is enjoying a prolonged second childhood before slipping gently into old age and absentmindedness.  He has had a love affair with reading his whole life. Horror, science fiction, fantasy and westerns all float his boat, providing him with inspiration for his own writing. Shaun’s future writing plans include another short story collection and a novella or two.</p>

	<p class="text4">"I will sweep away everything in all your land," says the Lord. "I will sweep away both people and animals alike. Even the birds of the air and the fish in the sea will die. I will reduce the wicked to heaps of rubble, along with the rest of humanity," says the Lord.</p>
	<p class="block40">Zephaniah 1:2-6</p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block28">THE WOMAN IN the black-boned corset looked up, as Cameron Rose stepped through the bat-wing doors of the honky-tonk, a sardonic smile trembling on her ruby lips. A silhouette bathed in dawn’s light, Cameron shook his head, agitating uncountable reams of swirling dust motes. </p>
	<p class="block29">“I‘m not going to waste time with excuses, but I came back as soon as I could.” </p>
	<p class="block29">The big man took a step forward. </p>
	<p class="block29">“You’re too late handsome, much too late,” she said.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Who did this?” His voice cracked on the words, and his right hand rested on the handle of the sawn off side-by-side shotgun tucked into the intricate leather belt slung around his hips.</p>
	<p class="block29">“It hurts, sweetheart. It hurts so…”</p>
	<p class="block29">The renegade biker moved toward Lily, falling to his knees in spilled beer and sawdust, and he touched his forehead to her knee.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Did…did you find a way back?” Lily asked.</p>
	<p class="block29">Cameron shook his head.</p>
	<p class="block29"> “I don’t think there is any escape from Bile County. I think we got a one-way ticket, Lily. Along with every other lost soul that ends up in this crazy fucked up world of weird skies and strange stars.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“You will find a way back to our world; I know you will, my love.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Lily’s words came out as little more than a whisper. </p>
	<p class="block29">Cameron watched the inky flower of Lily’s lifeblood slowly blossoming on the floor beneath her chair. Felt her shaking hand rest upon his grizzled head.</p>
	<p class="block29">“I’m going home now, my darling. England in July, that’s where I’ll be.” </p>
	<p class="block29">Her last words impaled his already breaking heart.</p>
	<p class="block29">Cameron stared at the ugly hole in Lily’s belly. The flow of blood from the ragged intrusion in her flesh had all but ceased and there was a smell. He looked closer. A faint almost ephemeral phosphorescent taint adhered to the wound site. He looked up and saw the vitality fading from the eyes of the woman he loved above all else.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Lily, don’t leave me like this.”</p>
	<p class="block29"> There was no reply. It felt like invisible hands were squeezing Cameron’s throat. Lily had given up the ghost. Cameron’s mind drifted, a funeral barge untethered, unmanned. He knelt before her, hot tears dripped from his eyes to mingle with the already congealing blood. A watery, yellow discharge began to bubble out of the hole in her stomach and a dark fire ignited within Cameron’s soul.</p>
	<p class="block29"> He turned at the sound of footsteps. Men from town, his old friend Saint among them. They shuffled their feet, uneasy in the presence of another’s grief.</p>
	<p class="block29">“It was an interloper, Cameron. A lunatic, two townies dead, Milo Thomas and the butcher, they hacked him to pieces with his own cleaver and hung the parts in his shop window. Milo, he dropped dead of a seizure when he saw what happened to the poor butcher...”</p>
	<p class="block29">Saint faltered, unable to look his friend in the eye.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Nobody tried to stop him?” Cameron asked. The question hung in the air, a thinly veiled accusation.</p>
	<p class="block29">The men in the room eyed each other nervously.</p>
	<p class="block29">“He came out of nowhere at dawn. Caught us off guard…” Again, Saint’s voice trailed off.</p>
	<p class="block29"> It was not lost on Cameron that Saint said two townsfolk. It irked him that even his friend still viewed Lily as an outsider. He shrugged off the urge to rail at their xenophobic traits. These people had good reason to fear outsiders, even ones who had lived among them for years. He got to his feet and stood with his head bowed before Lily’s warm corpse.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Burn the entire building, Saint. When you’re done, throw the quizmaster in the butcher’s shop, burn that too. Do it now.”</p>
	<p class="block29">A hapless townie gasped as Cameron spun on his heel, barged through the gathered group and out the bat-winged doors to the street</p>
	<p class="block29">“Ain’t natural that a man can move so fast.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Saint stared the complainer down. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Shut the fuck up and do like he says.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Outside, Cameron’s motorcycle reclined on its stand, metal ticking as it cooled.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Every man needs a shovel,” he growled, admiring the old Harley Davidson.</p>
	<p class="block29">He swallowed hard, trying to clear the blockage in his throat, his eyes stung. In the magenta sky above, the blistering orb of the sun crawled to its zenith.</p>
	<p class="block29">On the butcher’s door a ragged piece of paper fluttered in the hot breeze, pinned there by a thin bladed knife. Cameron crossed the street, triggering dust devils with each footfall.</p>
	<p class="block29">The note said, ‘We bury our dead here. Don’t interfere!!!’ The ink was still wet.</p>
	<p class="block29">Cameron removed the knife, screwed the note into a ball, and tossed it into the street. They might not be averse to a change from tradition if told about the plague, he thought. Almost absentmindedly, he slipped the knife into an empty sheath on his belt.</p>
	<p class="block29">He turned as the townies came out of the honky-tonk. The door swung shut behind them. Tendrils of smoke coiled out from a side window and dispersed on the wind. His stomach churned at the thought of Lily left alone inside. The townies departed, subdued. Saint alone remained, standing beside Cameron’s V-twin Shovelhead. </p>
	<p class="block29">Deep within the labyrinth of his mind, Cameron weighed the situation. He wanted to leave immediately, hunt down the interloper. He heard explosions inside the honky-tonk, fire discovering the alcohol behind the bar and getting frisky with it. </p>
	<p class="block29">Fire would purify Lily but not those other wretched souls. If their bodies went into the ground this whole town would die. He knew this to be true.</p>
	<p class="block29">Saint could stay here to supervise this clusterfuck but he knew he wouldn’t leave his old friend alone. He crossed the street.</p>
	<p class="block29">“I’m so sorry, Cameron. I was out repairing fences. By the time I got here…”</p>
	<p class="block29">“I know.” </p>
	<p class="block29">Cameron placed a hand on Saint’s shoulder.</p>
	<p class="block29">“He came to town on a motorcycle, like yours. Left in a hurry.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Then we need to move fast, saddle up that mare of yours. We need to get to the dead center of town.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Oh, you mean the boneyard.” There was no warmth in Saint’s smile.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Yep, that murdering bastard was a plague carrier. You know what I’m talking about.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Saint grimaced. A memory of tortured flesh and teeth rising through dark soil crossed his mind. He’d ridden with Cameron before when the big man travelled through Bile County.</p>
	<p class="block29">“I’m willing to bet a couple of burials are taking place today. Who’s new in town?” asked Cameron.</p>
	<p class="block29"><span class="calibre3">The tin tabernacle bled rust into a parched hillside northwest of town. Cameron’s bike chugged up the track in low gear. Saint plodded alongside on his old dun mare.  The bone yard claimed the southern slope of the rise. The two men came to a halt at the cemetery gate in the shade of a towering stone angel with a broken wing and bullet holes for eyes. </span></p>
	<p class="block29">The chapel’s corrugated sides rattled in the hot wind that scoured the hilltop. Cameron considered the terraced slopes and pathways of the cemetery to be a strange facet of this place of dry bones and immortal souls.</p>
	<p class="block29">He drew brass binoculars from his saddlebags and scanned the terraces.</p>
	<p class="block29">“I see them, Saint, two diggers, a woman, a preacher man.” </p>
	<p class="block29">“That’ll be Pastor Clyde and his wife, zealots both.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“The diggers?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Pension men, paid by the town council.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Cameron’s neck tingled. A bewitching signal danced along his spine. Rusty hinges creaked. He cried a warning, drew a knife that had only recently pinned a note to a door in town. A fiery discharge bloomed from the tabernacle door. The man’s throat opened in a tacky red ribbon even as he tried to chamber another round. His eyes reflected his dying thought. ‘It ain’t natural that a man can move so fast.’</p>
	<p class="block29">“I ain’t got time for this,” Cameron said. </p>
	<p class="block29">He turned and strode down through the terraces to confront Pastor Clyde and his followers. Saint had to jog in order to keep pace with him, his crop of sandy hair bouncing atop his head.</p>
	<p class="block29">The small group ahead of them looked agitated. The two pension men climbed out of the holes they had been digging and clutched their long handled shovels warily. The pastor appeared to be having a heated discussion with his wife, their arms gesticulating wildly, heads so close together they appeared to be kissing.</p>
	<p class="block29">Cameron approached to within ten feet, halted, drew the sawn off shotgun from his belt and let its presence sink in. The hired gravediggers threw down their shovels and ran off back in the general direction of the town.  Saint grinned. For old men, he thought, they moved fast. He was having a struggle catching his own breath after keeping up with his friend.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Pastor Clyde?”</p>
	<p class="block29">At first, Cameron thought the pastor meant to ignore him, but slowly the man straightened up and turned to face him. When he smiled, the man’s teeth seemed too big for his face; thin black strands of hair crisscrossed his sunburned head. It wasn’t the teeth or the bad comb over that intrigued Cameron though, it was the man’s clothing.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Don’t recollect seeing you in town last time I visited, Pastor. That’s a fancy outfit you’re wearing. It’s not often we see a turquoise shell suit around here.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Pastor Clyde didn’t miss a beat. He stepped forward opening his hands palms out in a friendly gesture, his smile never wavered.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Ah, now then, Mr. Rose. Yes indeed. We only arrived recently, came to minister the sick, aid the needy. Spread the word.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Cameron’s eyes flickered between the Pastor and his wife. While the Pastor remained outwardly friendly and calm, the woman beside him fidgeted.  Eyes cast down, shifting from one foot to the other. Her long black dress swayed as she moved, scattering dust from around her feet like a witch’s broom.</p>
	<p class="block29">“What word would that be?” Cameron asked, his trigger finger tensing imperceptibly. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Please, Sir. I’m just carrying out the wishes of the good people of this town. Laying the recently departed to rest in a seemly manner,” the Pastor said. His wife’s long bony fingers gripped his arm. </p>
	<p class="block29">“He knows,” she hissed.</p>
	<p class="block29">With a banshee like howl, she ran to Cameron’s left in a feint designed to draw his attention. The Pastor leapt forward, arms raised, his face a spitting mask of hate. </p>
	<p class="block29">Saint couldn’t pick up on all the subtleties of the interaction, but he had teamed up with Cameron Rose enough times to know when the big man needed back up. He slipped unnoticed behind the Pastor and his wife; he stooped to pick up a discarded gravedigger’s shovel, and waited. When the woman took off, he was ready. He swung it with all his might, the flat part of the metal blade hit her full in the face, stopping her in her tracks with a ringing thud.</p>
	<p class="block29">Cameron expected nothing less. He paid her no mind, and when the Pastor charged, he squeezed both triggers of the shotgun. It discharged a full load of lead shot into the man’s face, erasing it and the bad comb over crowning it in a welter of crimson spray.</p>
	<p class="block29">“What’s a shell suit then?” Saint asked.</p>
	<p class="block29">“A fashion faux pas long ago and far away from here, I met Lily in England.” Cameron said.</p>
	<p class="block29">Saint shook his head, bemused. He placed the tip of the shovel on the back of the woman’s neck and stepped on it hard. He didn’t bother to mention that he had no idea what England was any more than he knew what a shell suit was.</p>
	<p class="block29">“How did you know, Cameron?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“That they were in league with the plague carrier? I saw it in their eyes. Saw the hunger and the madness.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Saint shrugged, there was a lot he didn’t know about his friend, but he accepted the big man’s judgment on these matters. </p>
	<p class="block29">He did not know how anyone could stoop to such evil deeds as helping a plague carrier, luring one toward an unwary town, planting their seeds in the earth. He was grateful that when night came, nothing would be clawing its way back out of the ground in search of living flesh in his town. </p>
	<p class="block29">His town?</p>
	<p class="block29">A moment of understanding struck Saint with the same force he’d used to swing the gravedigger’s shovel at the woman’s head. He could not stay here. If he did, the people of this town would hang him for a murderer alongside Cameron. Together they would dance on thin air, become the bloated fruit of the gallows tree. </p>
	<p class="block29"><span class="calibre3">It did not matter that he was born among them, people who lived and died without ever going beyond the outskirts of town, deeply religious souls who mistrusted the outside world.  </span></p>
	<p class="block29">They knew nothing of plague bearers and their followers. </p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block24"> </p>
	<p class="block28">Together they piled up the corpses of the Pastor and his wife along with the remains of the two unfortunate victims from town.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Where do you think the plague bearer will go?” Saint asked.</p>
	<p class="block29">“North East by my reckoning. Cranville. He’ll follow the road.” </p>
	<p class="block29">“But that’s…nobody in their right mind goes there.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Yeah, I guess he’ll find that out.” </p>
	<p class="block29">The blue ice in Cameron’s eyes chilled Saint to the marrow.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Well, what are we waiting for? If we ride now we can be there soon after sunset,” Saint said, with more confidence in his voice than he felt in his heart. </p>
	<p class="block29">Soon after midday, a man on a motorcycle and a man on a horse rode northeast away from a cemetery on a hill. Behind them, a column of oily black smoke rose into the sky. </p>
	<p class="block29">Ruby Keller woke sometime after midnight, disturbed from sleep by Dominic thrashing beside her. Her world was silent, born deaf and orphaned in the first three years of her life, she survived twelve seasons on her wits alone. Though not true kin, Dominic was like a brother to her, they looked out for each other.</p>
	<p class="block29">Pale fingers of light from a three quarter moon pierced the gloom of their resting place beneath the town hall porch, arcing down through the cracks in the wooden boards above them. In a mining town like Cranville, orphan children were a sad reality of a harsh working environment but little provision was made for them. They survived as best they could.</p>
	<p class="block29">Reaching over, Ruby placed a hand on Dominic’s shoulder, gently shaking him until he woke from the nightmare gripping him. His eyes opened wide. She placed the first finger of her right hand to her lips indicating he should be quiet. Something was moving out on Main Street. </p>
	<p class="block29">During their time together, they had developed an effective sign language that enabled them to communicate almost anything. She used it now to alert Dominic they could be in danger. Together they shuffled forward using knees and elbows until they had a better view of the street. </p>
	<p class="block29">Normally, there would be nothing to fear from adults. People in Cranville rarely partied or got drunk. Working in the slope mines surrounding this desert town soon exhausted any desire for regular hard drinking. </p>
	<p class="block29">In the small hours of the night, an orphan child’s worst fear would be a pack of coyotes getting confident enough to wander in from the desert and grab what they could. Just the previous summer, a young girl had died that way, her ragdoll body dragged off into the night.</p>
	<p class="block29">Ruby shuddered at the thought of it. In another six months, both she and Dominic would be old enough to apply for jobs in the mines. Then, she thought, their circumstances would begin to improve. </p>
	<p class="block29">Despite the warmth of the night, Dominic’s hand felt cold when it grabbed her wrist. She followed the direction his finger pointed. Her heart skipped a beat in her chest. </p>
	<p class="block29">A column of figures approached along Main Street from the southwest, bathed in moonlight. They looked like men, but they were not. Ruby was sure of it. She looked at Dominic to check if he was seeing what she was seeing. His terrified expression told her he was.</p>
	<p class="block29">They came up Main Street like an invading army, creatures that looked like men. They were impossibly tall; some wore long black cloaks from head to foot while others were virtually naked apart from strange trinkets dangling from their necks, wrists and ankles. At the head of the procession, two of these creatures supported an enormous pole from which hung a ragged cloth banner covered in blood red symbols she did not recognize. The figures not wearing cloaks had short, muscular torsos and long, pale limbs. There was no hair on any part of their bodies, but perhaps worst of all, in their faces they had vertical slits for eyes and no discernible mouths. </p>
	<p class="block29">Dominic’s grip on her wrist had grown so tight it hurt. She turned to look at him. His face was ashen, his eyes wide. She tried to pull away but he would not let go.</p>
	<p class="block29"><span class="calibre3">The terrible procession continued, grew level and began to pass by. Ruby hardly dared draw breath as the pale limbs and black cloaks drifted past. She viewed it all from a place of silence. She may have been deaf but there was nothing wrong with her sense of smell.  Her nose wrinkled, offended by the strange odors that accompanied the column of men but not men. Odd perfumes, pungent, cloying, filled the night air, but underpinning that heady mixture there was something else, the smell of rotting flesh making her want to gag. </span></p>
	<p class="block29"><span class="calibre3">Midway along the column, a vehicle of sorts hove into view, a great black cage on wheels pulled by a team of the pale-limbed creatures. It reminded Ruby of a birdcage she had once seen in a shop window. There were no birds in this one, only people with vacant staring eyes.  </span></p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block28">Obadiah pressed a calloused thumb to his nose and blew a thread of snot from one nostril. Splattering the sterile bedrock, it sizzled in the heat.</p>
	<p class="block29">He saw movement. Desperate, the orphan boy bolted, running into the desert. Obadiah grinned, exposing his three remaining teeth. He raised a Smith &amp; Wesson 500 revolver with both hands and fired. </p>
	<p class="block29">The boy’s scalp lifted as the bullet from Obadiah’s pistol tore through his skull. He staggered on a few more steps, brainless as the scarecrow from The Wizard of Oz, before sagging to the ground in an awkward heap. Obadiah did a little dance, kicking up dust with his worn out boots. He flapped his arms like chicken wings.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Haw, I done fucked his shit up, God. I was on him like a hobo on a ham sandwich, for sure.”</p>
	<p class="block29">He came to a standstill, stared out into the empty desert and sighed.</p>
	<p class="block29">Obadiah placed the handgun to his temple and smiled. </p>
	<p class="block29">“I’m the last human. The crown is mine. You gotta give it to me now, God.”</p>
	<p class="block29">His nicotine-stained index finger tightened on the trigger of the gun, its muzzle burned the skin on his forehead. Somewhere a bell tinkled. </p>
	<p class="block29">Obadiah’s brow puckered. He wanted to believe it was just the wind, but there was not even the ghost of a breeze to stir a lazy dust devil. He lowered his weapon and turned to glare at the town behind him.</p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block28">The carcasses of dead people littered Main Street, but no flies swarmed on them. There were no birds in the sky, not even a feral dog skulking in the shadows. The world had become an empty place, except…the bell tinkled again.</p>
	<p class="block29">Obadiah turned on his heel. The door of the shop stood open. He could see the brass bell above it, still reverberating on its steel spring. He raised his gun, pointing it at the dark interior and waited.</p>
	<p class="block29">Nothing, he licked cracked lips with a tongue that felt like sandpaper. He glanced up at the shop sign and read its faded, peeling lettering: INK DONE While U WAIT!</p>
	<p class="block29">Obadiah recognized a sign from God when he saw one. It was in a tattoo parlor that God had first spoken to him back in Atlantic City U.S.A., commanding him to go out and kill, and so Obadiah obeyed. He wasn’t in Atlanta now, he wasn’t even sure if he was in America, He was a stranger in a strange land doing God’s work. God had promised Obadiah a golden crown to wear in heaven if he was the last man standing. </p>
	<p class="block29">Doing God’s work had become more difficult, not easier as Obadiah thought it would. There were so few people here they were hard to find and each time he thought he had killed the last one, another popped up. It was like playing that Whac-A-Mole game that frustrated him as a kid.</p>
	<p class="block29">Obadiah lowered his weapon and scratched absent-mindedly at his crotch with his free hand.</p>
	<p class="block29">“I think God wants me to go in there,” he said aloud to the corpse of an old man lying close to him. </p>
	<p class="block29">Dressed in baggy, faded denim coveralls, the old man continued to lay in the street, way past the point of having an opinion either way. </p>
	<p class="block29">According to the signpost Obadiah passed, he was in a town called Cranville. He hadn’t seen much life so far since arriving. Why was that?</p>
	<p class="block29">The dead man stared sightlessly from empty eye sockets. Obadiah wondered briefly if there were others doing God’s work besides him. He shrugged off the idea, turned away from the corpse and headed toward the shop doorway. His shadow stretched away before him, long and thin. That bell didn’t ring by itself.</p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block24"> </p>
	<p class="block28">Inside the shop, the day’s heat magnified to a stifling intensity. Obadiah’s skin prickled, sweat ran freely from his pores. Framed images of tattoo designs hung all around the wood clad walls. A green sofa and two mismatched armchairs filled most of the floor space of a small waiting room.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Business looks to be a bit slow today,” Obadiah said to the empty waiting room. </p>
	<p class="block29">He looked thoughtfully at a door with a stick on sign that said Warning! Tattoos make me horny! Obadiah stepped over to the door and turned the handle.</p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block24"> </p>
	<p class="block28">Ruby Keller stood watching the door handle turn. There was no sound. She had been deaf from birth but she was a survivor. She had been watching when the bad man came to town. She saw him flush out her friend from his hiding place and follow him out into the desert. The bad man came back to town alone. The bad man killed Dominic. </p>
	<p class="block29">Together they had survived a massacre. That’s what they did, Dominic and her, they survived. The town had gone to hell in the small hours but come dawn they were still alive, until the bad man walked into town.</p>
	<p class="block29">She picked up a rotary tattoo gun from its station next to a large reclining chair and shrank back against the wall, waiting. She couldn’t be sure if she had remembered to lock the door or not. There was no longer any electricity; she couldn’t remember when the town generators stopped working. She didn’t need it though. If the bad man came through the door, she would stab him with the needle at the business end of the tattoo gun. She would keep stabbing as long as she could.</p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block24"> </p>
	<p class="block28">Obadiah released his grip on the door handle. Someone had locked it from the other side. He stepped back from the door frowning. Warning! Tattoos make me horny!</p>
	<p class="block29">The sign mocked him. The heat is making me stupid, he thought. Someone’s in there, they could have shot me through the door when I tried the handle. Why didn’t they? He chewed on his lip, came to a decision, he would shoulder open the door, rush in and shoot anything that had a heartbeat. Somewhere far off he thought he heard the low roar of a motorcycle engine coming closer.</p>
	<p class="block29">Saint’s dun mare was beat. They had ridden through the heat of the day. Over the last sixty or so miles Cameron kept dropping back on the throttle of the Harley so his friend’s horse could keep pace. They made good time, reaching the outskirts of Cranville as the sun dipped toward the southern horizon. </p>
	<p class="block29">They eased their rides to a halt at the side of the road. Not much of a road, just hard packed earth the color of red ochre. Beside them, a tall wooden signpost bore the town’s name. The blackened letters burned into the bleached wood included a population count of 980. Somebody had scored a line through that number.</p>
	<p class="block29">Saint and Cameron dismounted, stretching and shaking their weary limbs. Bones cracked and popped in the dry desert heat. Both men grimaced.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Getting too old for this shit,” Saint said.</p>
	<p class="block29">“You and me both.” </p>
	<p class="block29">Saint favored his friend with a sideways glance, eyebrows rising. To him the big man looked the same now as the day they had met. </p>
	<p class="block29">“You’re as fast as ever you were,” he drawled.</p>
	<p class="block29">Cameron did not reply, instead he began to unfasten two of the five gallon Jerry cans fixed to a cradle over the Harley’s back wheel. These were plastic, containing water; the other two were metal fuel carriers for the bike.</p>
	<p class="block29">He hefted the water cans, testing them for content.</p>
	<p class="block29">“There’s enough for the horse to drink well, and a cup each for us.” </p>
	<p class="block29">Saint nodded. Cameron wouldn’t be drawn on his unusual physical abilities or other acumens. Saint might rib him from time to time, but in all the years he had known the man, he had never come right out and asked him about it. He figured that if Cameron were so inclined he would talk about it one day. Otherwise, it was none of Saint’s business.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Here, you’ll need this.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Saint stared at the object Cameron retrieved from the bike’s pannier bags.</p>
	<p class="block29">“What is it?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Collapsible bucket. Picked it up down south.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Saint shook his head in wonder. Down south, where the great Bile Swamp lay, there were trading posts, markets. Many strange and wonderful things came from there, strange people too and other things, darker, dangerous things. </p>
	<p class="block29">When Saint was a child, he listened to stories his grand pappy told him about the Bile Swamp and what came out of it. Tales to give children nightmares, tales his grandma refused to listen to. She would stamp her feet, curse her husband for an old fool and go around the house checking all the windows and doors were shut against the night.</p>
	<p class="block29">Cameron left Saint to water his horse and walked along the hard packed road a few yards closer to town, before taking out his brass telescope. </p>
	<p class="block29"><span class="calibre3">Cranville, a black sprawl of clapboard structures rising from the red desert sands, shimmered beneath the intensity of the magenta sky. Toward the south, the fierce disc of the sun slid toward the horizon.  Already the sky there grew darker, like a bruise swelling, spreading, growing. </span></p>
	<p class="block29">Somewhere out in the desert, a coyote howled. A plaintive sound, a chill finger touching Cameron’s spine. Lily was gone. If he survived the next few hours, he believed that coyote’s cry would haunt his dreams for many years to come.</p>
	<p class="block29">Cameron was still watching the town when Saint finished seeing to his mare’s needs.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Well, what do you see?” Saint asked, offering a tin cup full of water.</p>
	<p class="block29">Cameron closed the telescope with a snap and pocketed it, taking the water with a nod.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Nothing, not a damn thing, but he’s there. I’m sure of it.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“That’s what I was afraid of,” Saint said.</p>
	<p class="block29">“You afraid of a man, Saint?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“You know that ain’t the case, Cameron. There are plenty of other things to be afraid of in Cranville.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Saint remembered his grandma shutting the doors and windows of their little house against the night. He shuddered.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Might he have doubled back, Cameron, or gone elsewhere?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“No, he’s still here…” Cameron said. He gulped the water down and passed the tin cup back to Saint. “…And here he’s going to stay.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Saint watched open mouthed as his friend placed the empty Jerry cans back on his motorcycle.  He then sat astride the machine pumping the kick-start. It fired on the third kick.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Come on, Saint, stop fly catching. We’re going into town.” </p>
	<p class="block29">Climbing back into the saddle of his mare, Saint mumbled, “What flies? There are none, no damn birds either.” His statement was lost in the roar of the Harley’s engine as Cameron pulled away, spurts of red dust rising from the back wheel of the bike, Saint followed on behind chasing their shadows into Cranville.</p>
	<p class="block29">Obadiah had changed his mind, but not about kicking the door, the one with the damned stick on sign. He’d changed his mind about shooting anything behind it with a heartbeat. He might need something to bargain with or use as a shield.</p>
	<p class="block29">The door flew off its hinges when he put his boot to it. He laughed when he saw the dirty faced little vixen waiting for him. The little bitch had claws, tried to stab him with a tattoo gun. He laughed, continued to laugh as he dragged her out of the Tattoo shop by her long knotted hair, hair as red as the desert.</p>
	<p class="block29">She continued to struggle as he pulled her to the middle of Main Street. He wrapped her long knotted hair around her own neck and around his hand twice, lifting her until she stood on tiptoe. He pulled his revolver from its custom-made holster and ran the cold black muzzle down her left cheek. She ceased struggling and watched two figures approaching along the street, one on a machine she did not recognize, the other on horseback.</p>
	<p class="block29">Obadiah watched them too. He licked his lips. Things weren’t going well for him today. Freaking Whac-A-Moles popping up all over the place. </p>
	<p class="block29">These two fellas didn’t look much like moles, they looked like trouble to Obadiah.  He wanted that golden crown God had promised him. He didn’t want anyone else getting their filthy hands on it. He needed to play things carefully. The girl was a bargaining chip. He just had to hope these men liked little girls in one way or another. He held the girl out in front of him, so they could get a good look at her and put on his best welcoming smile.</p>
	<p class="block29">Half way down Main Street, Saint and Cameron stopped, dismounted and came forward on foot. A cool breeze drifted in from the desert, stirring eager dust devils to life. The sun had slipped below the horizon.</p>
	<p class="block29">“He the one?” Murmured Saint under his breath.</p>
	<p class="block29">Cameron just nodded. Saint licked his lips, plague carriers made him uncomfortable.</p>
	<p class="block29">“That’s close enough, gentlemen.” Obadiah jiggled the gun in his hand, drawing attention to it.</p>
	<p class="block29">“What happened here mister, have you any idea?” Saint asked, hands on hips. He nodded toward the dead who lay all around.</p>
	<p class="block29">Obadiah frowned, the dead didn’t bother him. He liked them just fine the way they were. Why were the newcomers dragging them into the conversation? He was beginning to get a headache. He noticed the man talking carried no weapon. The other one though, the big man, he had a sawn off shotgun holstered in his belt. Perhaps things weren’t so bad after all. He definitely had the advantage.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Let the girl go and we can talk.” The big man spoke for the first time.</p>
	<p class="block29">Obadiah’s gun had alternated between the two but now settled on the one with the shotgun, the one giving him orders. He licked his lips and held the girl higher, ignoring the choking sound coming from her mouth.</p>
	<p class="block29"><span class="calibre3">“Here’s the deal. Take the girl, she’s all yours. I’m sure you have…needs. I’ll just walk in the other direction, see.”  </span></p>
	<p class="block29">Sweat beaded Obadiah’s brow. He jerked his head toward the road behind him.</p>
	<p class="block29">“No deal,” Cameron said.</p>
	<p class="block29">It felt to Obadiah as if his brain had grown too large for the confines of his skull. It hurt to think. In the gathering dusk, he saw movement further down the street, coming from beneath the town hall steps. A small figure dragged itself out from beneath the wooden porch and stood dusting itself off. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Do you see that, over there, a kid? They’re like rats around here.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Pointing with the muzzle of his handgun, Obadiah tried to draw Cameron’s attention to the boy now walking towards them. Cameron’s eyes remained fixed on Obadiah, but Saint looked over his shoulder.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Yep, he’s right. There’s a boy walking this way.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Obadiah squinted at the child until realization dawned on him. Something cracked beneath his hand. He turned his attention to the red headed girl. He must have squeezed too tight, her head sagged, limp and lifeless.</p>
	<p class="block29">The boy stood alongside Cameron and Saint. For a moment, Obadiah clearly saw the damage his bullet had done when it cleaved a path through the child’s skull out in the desert. </p>
	<p class="block29">“That’s not possible. I killed you.” </p>
	<p class="block29">Obadiah pointed the gun at the boy whose head had now become complete again. It shook in his hand. </p>
	<p class="block29">“You’ve run out of bargaining chips,” Cameron said. He took a step forward.</p>
	<p class="block29">Something caressed the back of Obadiah’s hand; he made an odd squawking sound and dropped the dead girl. Instead of folding up, collapsing to the floor like an empty sack, Ruby’s feet connected with the ground and she remained standing. Her eyes opened. She moved her head from side to side; it cracked as before and returned to a natural position. She smiled when she saw that Dominic had returned.</p>
	<p class="block29">Saint sprinted to the left, toward the tattoo parlor’s open door, remembering the feint the Pastor’s wife had attempted. It worked all too well for him. </p>
	<p class="block29">Obadiah tracked him, squeezed off a shot. The bullet went wide, punched through the shop’s clapboard wall.</p>
	<p class="block29">He never got a chance for a second shot. He had less than a second to register the blur that bore down on him. Cameron hit him in the face with the butt of the sawn off shotgun, smashing his nose. He keeled over backward, landing on the hard packed dirt of the street. </p>
	<p class="block29">A magnificent profusion of strange stars glittered like diamond dust above the town of Cranville. Between them, Cameron and Saint had lashed Obadiah’s unconscious body to an old cartwheel. They hauled him up to a sturdy signpost. Saint knelt, picked up some sunbaked earth from the street and rubbed it between his hands.</p>
	<p class="block29">“I feel dirty, Cameron.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“You’ve no cuts have you, bites, scratches, wounds? It’s my guess that’s how the plague gets in.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“That’s not what I meant.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Saint nodded toward the man hanging from the wheel.</p>
	<p class="block29">“I don’t like what we’re doing. It feels wrong.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“We have no choice,” Cameron said, his face set hard like stone. “We leave him for the Necromancers, let them judge him.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“You think they’re still here?”</p>
	<p class="block29">Cameron nodded. </p>
	<p class="block29">The Necromancers, Saint didn’t even like to say the name out loud, yet another tribe of interlopers. Why they chose Cranville nobody could say. They slaughtered the townsfolk, the children, well, Saint hardly dared believe half of the rumors about what happened to them. It was said that the Necromancers used their victims for dark magic practices, seeking to find a way out of Bile County, to whatever world they called home. It seemed they had failed.</p>
	<p class="block29">Saint knew his friend also searched for a way home. He guessed Cameron and Lily were interlopers long ago. They also longed to find a way back to a place where the stars were not strange, but they never sought to harm anyone in the process.</p>
	<p class="block29">“He’s coming round.” </p>
	<p class="block29">Something, a shadow perhaps, stirred at the edge of Saint’s vision. He got up from his kneeling position. He was sure there were now less dead bodies lying in the street.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Hey, what the fuck! Set me down!”</p>
	<p class="block29">Obadiah was awake. Cameron thought he looked pissed. Or maybe it was the damage the butt of his shotgun had done to the man’s face that made him look so ugly.</p>
	<p class="block29">“There’s no sense you struggling, mister. We ain’t about to let you go,” Saint said.</p>
	<p class="block29">“You don’t understand, I’m doing God’s work. Killing is my business.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“But you’re not killing, are you? You’re spreading the disease, sentencing innocent people to a terrible reanimation, turning them into mindless eaters of living flesh.”</p>
	<p class="block29">It was Cameron who spoke. He looked up at Obadiah spread-eagled on the wheel, and the symbolism was not lost on him. It was as if they had crucified the anti-Christ himself.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Cameron.”</p>
	<p class="block29">All around them the dead were walking, among them Ruby Keller and Dominic. These weren’t plague victims. Not the undead but truly dead. </p>
	<p class="block29">Cranville was a town of ghosts.</p>
	<p class="block29">“We should go,” Saint said.</p>
	<p class="block29">Cameron looked out toward the desert, where the surface shafts of the slope mines stood. Eerie green light shone from their openings.</p>
	<p class="block29">“I think you’re right.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Obadiah began to strain against the ropes that held him, thrashing his head from side to side, and bubbles of yellow liquid burst upon his lips. </p>
	<p class="block29">Figures were emerging from the mineshafts. Impossibly tall, men but not men, some in black robes, others, naked, pale and curious.</p>
	<p class="block29">“C’mon, we’re leaving,” Cameron said.</p>
	<p class="block29">Saint followed him down the street in silence. There was nothing to say that could be heard over the roar of Obadiah’s furious ranting.</p>
	<p class="block29">They passed by, and inadvertently through, some of the wandering ghosts that roamed Main Street. Most paid them no attention, though a few seemed angry at the presence of the living in their town.</p>
	<p class="block29">Columns of Necromancers streamed from the mineshafts, heading in toward the center of town, drawn by Obadiah’s shouts and threats. They were almost at the place where Cameron’s bike and Saint’s horse waited when the big man stopped abruptly. Saint almost collided with his back. </p>
	<p class="block29">Thinking Necromancer’s cut them off, Saint prepared to fight before he realized what his old friend was looking at. Ahead of them, standing still amidst the endlessly roaming ghosts, Lily waited next to Cameron’s motorcycle.</p>
	<p class="block29">“I see you ditched that damn silly trapper’s hat.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Cameron hesitated only a moment, and then he was at her side. Saint waited at what he hoped was a respectful distance. More of the roaming ghosts seemed to be giving him the evil eye. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Lily, I…”</p>
	<p class="block29">“It seems even in death one cannot leave Bile County. This is where the dead live, my love, you can’t stay here.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Cameron reached out, touched Lily’s lips with trembling fingers. To his relief she felt solid. She responded by moving closer.</p>
	<p class="block29">Saint stood by. Angry ghosts jostled him, turned to leer at him. They bumped against his mare, causing the normally placid beast to pull at her tether, her eyes rolling. Saint pushed through the ghostly crowd, intent upon reaching his horse before she ran off into the night. Behind them, an unearthly scream split the night. The Necromancers had judged Obadiah and found him wanting.</p>
	<p class="block29">Looking back, Saint could see pale figures striding down the street. They reminded him of the long shadows that had preceded him and Cameron when they came to this place. Saint managed to keep his horse from bolting by throwing himself up into the saddle.</p>
	<p class="block29">“We go now, or stay here forever,” he hollered.</p>
	<p class="block29">Lily pushed Cameron gently but firmly away.</p>
	<p class="block29">“I’m home now, my darling. It will always be England in July in my heart. Think of me every now and then, won’t you?”</p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block"> </p>
	<p class="block28">At dawn on the following day, Cameron and Saint slipped into a cave some sixty miles southwest of Cranville. They drank clear cool spring water that bubbled up within the cave’s interior. Tired beyond measure, they prepared themselves to sleep the rest of the day, sheltered from the heat of the desert sun.</p>
	<p class="block29">Neither had a home to which they could return, but they were alive and that was enough. Saint dreamed of travelling. He visited worlds far beyond Bile County, worlds in which strange stars filled the night sky.</p>
	<p class="block37">Cameron’s sleep was dreamless, untroubled by the lonely howling of the coyote.</p>
