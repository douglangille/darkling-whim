	<p class="block"> </p>
	<p class="block21">Theresa chose to place her serious writing pursuits on hold while raising her family, and she has no regrets. With her children growing older and needing her attention less, she began a search for a new support community. After joining Writer’s Carnival, the muse within her awoke after dozing for some time. She has renewed her dreams and enjoys participating in poetry readings and poetry slams, and has received 2nd and 3rd places in contests, with an honorable mention in another. With the support of her fiancé, Lee, her children, and with the collaboration with her co-authors, Theresa is pursuing her first venture in dark fiction.</p>

	<p class="block28">ARI BOLTS STRAIGHT up in bed, gasping for air. His muscular chest, naked and soaked with sweat, confines his pounding heart. Piercing screams echo inside his mind. Darkness escapes from within, consuming the shadows. The nightmare is the same horror from his childhood, and he wonders if he will ever find peace.</p>
	<p class="block33">Something is wrong. Another presence looms near.</p>
	<p class="block29">Lightning slashes silver through the starless night as the storm’s minions attack the glass. Ari grasps the quilt his mother made him long ago, pulling it to his chin. Secluded in the shadow of a granite cliff, with lodge-pole pines as the only sentries for the night, Colorado storms are daunting.</p>
	<p class="block29">Memory whispers of this evening's Harvest moon, now shrouded in darkness. He tries to find comfort in this thought. Crisp air and golden aspens symbolize his time for change. Tomorrow, he will be moving on.</p>
	<p class="block29">Ari wonders why he is naked, searching the corners of his mind for a glimmer. <i class="calibre6">There was a woman.</i> Relieved, he reaches for her. Sadness stings his heart as he realizes she is gone.</p>
	<p class="block29">He wonders why they never stay. They admire his golden hair, brilliant blue eyes, and ability to make them laugh. The sex is pleasing, and he caresses their soft bodies afterward. Their pillow talk carries them off to sleep. Yet he always wakes alone.</p>
	<p class="block29">Holly was different.  Her name brings a smile to his lips. Ari met her six months ago. Her chestnut hair and eyes of jade transfixed him immediately. She possessed a gentle magnetic strength. Their daily conversations grew from casual to comfortable. They shared secrets.</p>
	<p class="block33">Breathe.</p>
	<p class="block29">Thunder hammers lightning bolts into his heart. Instead of counting measures between breaths, he finds himself counting seconds between flashes and concussions. The storm is moving closer.</p>
	<p class="block33">It is coming.</p>
	<p class="block29">After years of practice, he still struggles to find inner peace.</p>
	<p class="block33">Focus on the inner light. Deep breaths, relax. Focus.</p>
	<p class="block29">His memory flashes to this morning. A pastel sunrise slipped through the clouds. After a short prayer, he showered, wrapped in a clean towel, and walked seven steps to the dresser. He opened the drawer, closed it, and opened it twice more before choosing dark blue socks, a matching shirt and black jeans. He completed his routine before walking leisurely to the White Orchid. Upon entering, melodic sounds of gentle stringed instruments and bamboo flutes welcomed him. A large Zen garden was being raked smooth by a bald man wearing hemp sandals and a Hawaiian shirt. Ari found his seat in the corner, facing the room. The menu sported items such as hummus, taro chips, and wheat grass.</p>
	<p class="block29">Holly was his waitress, as usual. She brought his cup of chamomile tea. He added seven drops of honey, stirred counterclockwise seven times. He saw her questioning look. “To keep the boogeyman away.”  He watched her walk away.</p>
	<p class="block29">She was fluid, transforming the simplest tasks into art. Her hands were brushes, the world her palette. A mother of pearl comb kept her hair pulled back, but one unruly strand managed to escape. Laughter played on plump lips. Flowing skirts and peasant blouses hinted at her ample curves. Ari asked her once if she danced. The light in her eyes dimmed. “I took classes for a while.” A long pause, then a soft click of her tongue. “It was a long time ago.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Ari ordered an almond milk smoothie and quinoa with berries. It wasn’t what he was craving. He craved meat, raw, bloody meat. His mother removed it from his diet years ago. In the past, he gave himself the luxury of indulging once a year, but he didn’t care for his feelings afterward. Meat wasn’t an option. Holly was the only temptation here.</p>
	<p class="block29">He steeled his courage and hid his trembling hands. In between the humorous banter from the other patrons and himself, he blurted out, “Have dinner with me tonight, to celebrate.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Celebrate what?” she asked. He promised to fill her in over dinner.</p>
	<p class="block29">Holly considered carefully, while he chanted silently, “say, yes… say yes.”  She agreed to meet him at Daphne’s, a small Mediterranean restaurant. Ari had no idea Holly had her own agenda.</p>
	<p class="block29">Ari completed his business at his office, said his goodbyes, and then walked to Daphne's. He slowed his walk a block from the restaurant and watched her from a distance. She stood in front of the restaurant, holding a beaded bag and a denim jacket. Her arms were tanned darker than her legs. She spent more time in a garden than in a salon. A white cotton dress hugged her body, and freckles adorned glowing shoulders. A silver necklace with a jade stone glinted against her bronzed skin. Ari’s heart skipped when her smile greeted him. Her hair was damp and smelled of lavender.</p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block28">His mind plunges to the depths of darkness once again. A gust of wind tosses something metal against the house. His heart pounds for several empty seconds, then memories surface once more.</p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block43"> </p>
	<p class="block28">They agreed on the vegetable plate with spanakopitas, falafel, and tomato and mozzarella salad. Ari suggested the Argillae Grachetto wine. Holly nibbled on olives and finished her first glass before their food arrived. Ari listened to soft 70's tunes above his head and tried to think of something intelligent to say.</p>
	<p class="block29">“So.” Holly’s voice caused him to jump. “What sort of work do you do?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“I’m a rural consultant.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Ari explained his family worked with scientists and missionaries all over the world to help farmers in struggling countries grow healthier, more substantial crops. It was a noble notion, but Ari chose this profession because he enjoyed traveling.</p>
	<p class="block29">“What do you mean?” She played with her necklace.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Every year on the fall equinox, I move to a different place. </p>
	<p class="block29">We started the habit when I was little. I’m not sure why.” His voice trailed off. “I have OCD, you know, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. At least the doctors diagnosed it when I was a kid. I do the exact same thing all the time.” She cocked her head. “Exactly the same thing?”</p>
	<p class="block29">He blushed. “Well, a few things are different. Anyway, we’ve got houses all over the place. Most of them are way out in the boonies. New Mexico, Texas, Wyoming. Actually, we’ve got about twenty places in the States, and a couple in other countries.” Ari brought his glass to his mouth, and then lowered it. “I don’t mean to sound like I’m bragging. It’s not like they’re huge mansions. Just simple houses. Each one has its own caretaker and is completely furnished. It makes it easier to move from place to place without having to pack over and over.” Ari paused. “As luck would have it, the house I’m in now is my family home, where I was born. Tomorrow, I'm off to a new place.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Must be nice.” Holly tore off a chunk of pita bread. “I never could understand people who live in one place all their lives. I need change. I want to see the world.”</p>
	<p class="block29">He chewed slowly, considering his response. “So… the OCD thing doesn’t bother you?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“No. Why should it? Everybody has something. Your ‘something’ seems pretty tame. You should see some of the things I’ve done.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Should I be worried?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Hmm,” she teased. “Maybe.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Maybe there’s more to me than you know,” he replied.</p>
	<p class="block29">She laughed. “What do you consult farmers and ranchers on, exactly?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Everything.” He took a bite of cheese. “Finances to seeds. Machinery. Eco-friendly fertilizers, weed and pest control.” He took another bite. “Mmm, this is good.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Pest control? You mean like grasshoppers and stuff?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Yeah, but more. A lot of times, there are moles, gophers, prairie dogs. They can really tear up the land. Tunnels make the soil erode, crap for drainage and animals getting hurt. We try to help them get rid of the critters, ya know? Without poisoning the dog or Mr. Jones’ grandkids, see?”</p>
	<p class="block29">She finished chewing on a bite of pastry. “Do you just trap them and move them into little condos?”</p>
	<p class="block29">He grinned. “Well, it would be the best thing for the moles. But they can’t afford the rent.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“You have a little sarcasm on your chin there, Sparky.” She wiped his mouth with her napkin. He played along, enjoying her touch.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Seriously, relocation doesn’t always work. We tried releasing owls into the area. But the gophers just move into Farmer Brown's pasture, and Farmer Brown don’t take too kindly to new tenants. Unfortunately, most people just wanna kill ‘em. The easiest way is to gas them.” She cringed. “I know. It makes me sad too. Poor little things just wanna eat. But the gas seems to be the quickest way, and it’s better than drowning them.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“What kind of gas is it?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Zinc phosphide. It’s a little powder you mix with water. It reacts with water to make phosphine gas. It fills the tunnels and kills them pretty quick. It is toxic, caustic, and flammable. Nasty stuff.” He chuckled lightly. “Smells like garlic. It won’t keep the vampires away, but it will melt your face off. Definitely not something you want lying around the house. Now, can we change the subject? Something about gassing gophers isn’t setting too well with my meal.” He took a sip of wine. “Tell me about you.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Not much to tell, really. I had a perfect life until I was nine. Both parents, sweet little three bedroom house, little sister, Golden Retriever.” She took a long drink, a bite of her salad, another long drink. Ari refilled her glass silently, knowing there was more. Holly’s eyes dimmed as she looked down at the table. “They were all killed in a terrible accident. Fire. Even the damn dog. I was spending the night with a friend. My creepy grandparents raised me. I rebelled, became a free spirit, moved to Colorado. My cousin, Robert, owns White Orchid. But I'm ready to move on.” She sighed. “Such is life. Now, more about you. I know there’s more to you than gopher assassin.”</p>
	<p class="block29">He laughed and gave her hand a tight squeeze. She smiled and squeezed back. Without qualms, he told her about having no memory before his seventh birthday. His first memory was of waking in the dark, the taste of copper in his mouth. His screams brought his mother and father running. The click of the light switch revealed an ugly scene. He was covered in blood. A dead raccoon lay in his bed; stomach ripped open, wide eyes staring at him. Then the nightmares began.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Oh wow. So did you ever find out what happened?” She looked concerned, but not disgusted, as he had feared.</p>
	<p class="block29">He shook his head. “No. All I know is we moved to another town, and I couldn’t stand the taste of raccoon.” A nervous chuckle escaped him. “Sorry, bad joke.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“No worries.” She encouraged him to continue.</p>
	<p class="block29">In elementary school, a boy named Paul challenged him over the front row seat. Ari’s teeth ripped the mocking smile from his face. Both boys were taken away in ambulances. Paul went to the emergency room. Ari went to a mental institution. The archaic methods did more harm than good. Restraints and electro-therapy only served to open a portal to the depths of his madness. His mother removed him from the institution with a wad of cash and a promise to relocate. He was schooled at home.</p>
	<p class="block29">Puberty was difficult for all young boys, but his surge in testosterone brought erotic dreams mingled with nightmares. The morning sheets were wet with semen mixed with blood. His memory neglected to inform him of the circumstances. “Mom wouldn’t let me eat meat anymore. She said it made me crazy. She wouldn't allow me to play sports, be around girls, or hang out with other kids. Not that they wanted to hang out with me. I was a total nerd. Socks with sandals, ugly glasses, dorky haircut,” he mused.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Hmm, sexy.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Ari handed his napkin to her. “Who's being sarcastic now?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Touche'. Please go on. I want to know how a young boy who had a taste for raccoon becomes a man with a fondness for gophers.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Homeopathic remedies, yoga, rituals, prayers. And one little psych med I take every morning.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“A real success story.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Do you really think so?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“You were a child with an uncontrollable illness. I don't see anything scary in you now.”</p>
	<p class="block29">He shrugged his shoulders.</p>
	<p class="block29">She reached for his hand. “No violent tendencies in the last few hours or so?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“No. I've been in control for years now.” Ari continued. “I graduated with honors, but nobody gave a shit.  And after eight years of college, I am now a walking alphabet. None of which I actually need because I work with my parents, but it does impress the girls.”</p>
	<p class="block29">She chuckled and tipped her glass to him. “Shall we order another bottle of wine to celebrate?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“What are we celebrating now?”</p>
	<p class="block29">Holly smiled and raised her head. “Silly man. I’m going with you.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“What?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Oh, why not? We like each other, right? I want to leave, and you just happen to be leaving. If it doesn't work out, we go our separate ways.”</p>
	<p class="block29"><span class="calibre3">Ari escorted her to her apartment, holding hands under the enormous moon. Multicolored leaves skittered around their feet like frantic mice. Somber clouds congregated above the mountains.“Storm's coming.” He caught a golden aspen leaf and placed it into his pocket.  </span></p>
	<p class="block29">“What’s the leaf for?” she asked.</p>
	<p class="block29">“If you catch a falling leaf on the first day of fall, you won’t catch a cold all winter. Tomorrow's first day, but I figure this is close enough.” He shrugged. “At least Mom always said so. She was superstitious about a lot of things.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Like what?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Well, she always told me to keep salt on the threshold for good luck. I get out of the bed exactly the same way every day, stir the tea seven times, and keep garlic in every room. Burn sage in a new house.” His uncomfortable laugh penetrated the silence. “My mother is a nut.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Odd.” She reached for her necklace, holding the jade stone in her hand. “My grandmother always told me the same things.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Ari watched the storm brewing while she packed her belongings into a duffel bag and a small wooden chest. They called a cab to take them to his house. The driver complained about the drive up the mountain. “You will take us.” Ari’s sharp eyes drove the point home. He shoved a hundred dollar bill into the man’s fat hand.</p>

	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block28">Lightning illuminates his room once more. Shadows gyrate on the wall. Slight rustling stills his breath before the thunder cracks. Flesh rises on his damp skin. He listens, a long moment, hears only the silence of the night.</p>
	<p class="block29"><i class="calibre6">Someone is near</i>.</p>
	<p class="block29">Trepidation holds him to his bed. <i class="calibre6">Focus… there’s nothing here. It’s just a dream. </i>He inhales deeply, suspends his breath, and releases the negative energy as he had been taught. He tries to envision Holly’s face. He feels his mind drifting, muscles releasing, warmth returning to his fingertips. Then panic clutches his throat as his mind travels unwillingly to memories that are not his own.</p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block28">Martin Dunlap was never afraid of hard work. He worked on a ranch to pay for college at Texas A&amp;M and graduated in 1956. He earned a degree in Agricultural Science and another in Business Finance. He eventually purchased a small farm and ranch consultant firm. His roommate, Roger Stewart, worked to develop innovative, Eco-friendly methods. They became rich in their partnership. Martin married and had a daughter, Rachael. She was raised traveling with her parents, working with missionaries in Third World desert locations. She fell in love with Martin’s vision and with Roger’s son, David.</p>
	<p class="block29">During a cooperative mission to Bethlehem, David placed a simple gold ring on her hand as a symbol of his love. Rachael's ivory skin and blonde hair complimented David’s tall muscular frame and dark features. They were disappointed to learn they weren't allowed to share sleeping quarters. They settled for time alone in the markets.</p>
	<p class="block29">Sandstone buildings with red tile roofs lined narrow cobblestone streets. More than three hundred street vendors welcomed them with vibrant embroidered fabrics, pottery, and antiquities. A sea of carts overflowed with produce, teas, and coffees. Exotic curry, spicy cinnamon, and smoky barbeque cut through lingering smells of rotting garbage and too many people. Old women sat silently and formed chocolate truffles by hand. Waves of blaring horns and chattering vendors drowned out the hiss of lamb fat dripping into open fires. One insistent vendor waved his skinny arms, yelling. “See Azzan’s wares! Ancient! True!” A second vendor, leathered from years in the desert sun, offered them sticky bites of baklava to entice them.</p>
	<p class="block29">David was drawn to a red clay oil lamp. It was shaped like a small leaf with the stem turned upward, with two small holes. Small markings resembling wheels and suns covered the surface. Cotton was stuffed into the holes to protect it from breaking.</p>
	<p class="block29">Rachael discovered a simple, gray pitcher with a fat bottom and a small handle. A small chip on the opening was the only flaw. Azzan said, “Is from the time of Jesus.”  Rachael detected a faint scent through the cotton; earthy, spicy, and woody. The vendor explained it was galbanum, rosewood, and frankincense. “Anointing oil. Is good for soul, is good for teeth.” Azzan displayed a horse-like grin.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Hmm…” Rachael turned to explore elsewhere.</p>
	<p class="block29">“How do I know this stuff is genuine?” David asked.</p>
	<p class="block29">“It has a seal and a certificate of authenticity,” Azzan stated in a monotone, rehearsed voice. “These were formed from the same earth as Adam.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“And Lilith,” claimed the older vendor.</p>
	<p class="block29">Azzan waved his hand to shush him. “Yoni!”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Who is Lilith?” David had asked.</p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block28">Ari’s heart races as he struggles to understand. <i class="calibre6">What are these memories? </i>His bladder twinges. He summons the courage to leave his bed.</p>
	<p class="block29">The rain is gone, but lightning flashes near. Fat drops cling to the panes, silver with the return of the moon. The sharp hoot of an owl travels on the crisp breeze. Ari’s feet tingle from the chill of tile. He reaches for the light switch. The familiar click disappoints him. <i class="calibre6">Damn</i>. He digs in a drawer, finds a candle and a box of matches. The odor of sulfur fills his nostrils. The flame reveals the face in the mirror, and it is not his own. Dark stains matting the hair on his chest…not sweat, but blood. <i class="calibre6">No! How could this be?</i></p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block29">“You know Alphabet of Ben Sira?” Yoni asked. The younger vendor raised his hands and walked away.</p>
	<p class="block29">“No, I’ve never heard of it,” David replied.</p>
	<p class="block29">The graying vendor began his story, speaking in Arabic. Rachael translated. “There are many stories about Lilith. Some say she was a fallen angel, cast from Heaven because of her insatiable sexual appetite. Lilith was Adam’s first wife. In Genesis 1:27 it says ‘male and female He created them.’ Lilith was fashioned from the earth at the same time as Adam. Eve was Adam’s second wife fashioned from his rib. The Bible doesn’t say this until the second chapter of Genesis. Lilith was disobedient to Adam because she would not submit to him. She uttered the true name of God and flew into the air.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Legend says Lilith joined with Samael, another fallen angel. She gave birth to one hundred evil babies a day, until God punished her. He castrated Samael and cursed her with infertility, and killed many of her babies. In their rage, Lilith and Samael became the incubus and the succubus. They are demons of the night, seducing men and women in their sleep.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Lilith was furious with God because she was being punished. She traveled through the night, killing newborn babies. Three angels found her in the Red Sea, and demanded she repent. Lilith made a promise to not harm babies who are protected by an amulet with the names of the three angels. The names of these angels are Senoy, Sansenoy, and Semangelof. This is how you say them in English.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Lilith gathers the seed of men and gives it to Samael. The incubus can then make babies with women. These babies are cambion. They are intelligent, beautiful, and very convincing. Merlin the magician was one of these babies. Merlin was the son of a demon, but chose to serve God. Madness overtook Merlin, but he could not die. The Lady of the Lake trapped him in a hawthorn tree where he resides to this day.”</p>
	<p class="block29">David scoffed. “Merlin. Nonsense. Why haven’t we heard of these night demons before?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Lilith is mentioned in the Bible, although not by name. In the book of Isaiah. She is sometimes called a ‘screech owl.’ The Hebrew word is ‘Lilith’. Christians have left out some of these stories. Just because something is not in the Bible, doesn’t mean it didn’t happen.” He dropped a coin onto the bricks. “You see? This event is not in the Bible. It does not mean it did not occur.”</p>
	<p class="block29">David and Rachael bought the pottery, along with an embroidered prayer shawl and praying hands carved from olive wood. Yoni claimed the wood was from a branch pruned from a blessed tree, hundreds of years old.</p>
	<p class="block29">Before she left, Azzan hurried to place a silver necklace into her hand. He whispered urgently, “Amulet… has the angels on it. You are both virgins, yes?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“What a thing to ask!” Rachael tried to give back the amulet, but the man insisted.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Wear it. Place it over bed when you first sleep with your husband. Keep away demons. When you are pregnant. Over the door for baby’s room. Protect your baby when he is born,” he whispered.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Thank you.” She smiled and took David’s hand.</p>
	<p class="block29">When David and Rachael arrived back in the United States, they decided to live at Rachael’s house. They spent the first day settling in the house, unloading boxes, and buying groceries. Neither of them would admit they were nervous about their first night together. Awkward smiles during dinner made them feel like children.</p>
	<p class="block29">Rachael showered first. She slipped a silky white gown over her head, blushing as the fabric slid down her body. While David showered, she removed the cloth from each of the vessels. Dusty smells defined their age.</p>
	<p class="block29">“It’s hard to believe these may have been formed from the same earth as Adam.” David had slipped up behind her, making her jump.</p>
	<p class="block29">“His story was pretty crazy, huh?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Yeah, it was. The ancient stories fascinate me. I wonder if there’s any stock in the stories about Lilith and Samael.” He lit a stick of sandalwood incense.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Who knows?” Rachael spread the prayer shawl on the mantel. She placed the small wooden hands in the center, adjusting them carefully. The little leaf shaped lamp rested next to the hands. Scents from the perfume bottle drifted to her nose. “I just love the smell of this oil. It’s supposed to be holy.” She set the bottle on the shelf, nicking her finger on the opening. A small drop of blood stained the clay. “Ouch!” She stuck her finger in her mouth, sucking softly.</p>
	<p class="block29">David pulled her hand to his mouth, kissing it.</p>
	<p class="block29">Her blood stirred. “A lot of the other stories from the Bible are unbelievable, but as Christians, we are supposed to believe them.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Mm-hmm.” David continued kissing her hand, drawing her fingers one by one into his mouth.</p>
	<p class="block29">She spoke again, partly for distraction. “If it is true, I don’t know how I feel about it. I almost feel sorry for them. It would be terrible to be punished so severely there was no hope of redemption.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Yeah, I suppose you’ve got a point there.” He nuzzled the back of her neck, making her giggle. She leaned back against him as he encircled her waist. “Rae? Are you about ready to call it a night?”</p>
	<p class="block29">She touched the hands. “Yes, but first I want to say a house blessing.” Together, they prayed God would bless them in their marriage, and all who entered.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Here, help me take this off.” She reached for the amulet.</p>
	<p class="block29">“What’s this for?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Azzan told me to wear it, and then put it over our bed when we, well, on our first night together. It’s supposed to protect us from the incubus and the succubus.” She lifted her golden hair.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Ooh, creepy.” David lifted her into his arms, eliciting a squeal. He carried her into their bedroom, unaware they were not alone. Deep within the ancient vessels, the spirits breathed. One of them found the promise of life in the tiny drop of Rachael’s blood.</p>
	<p class="block29">In the morning’s light, Rachael wrapped up on the couch with a cup of coffee. She reflected on her night with David, humming. Her thoughts were interrupted by a faint sense of someone else in the room. Drifting in the steam, a woman’s face appeared. The cup shattered on the floor.</p>
	<p class="block29">David rushed into the room. “What’s happened?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“You wouldn’t believe me.” Her face was pale.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Try me.” David sat on the couch while Rachael told him what happened. “Well, I can’t explain it, but I do believe you.”</p>
	<p class="block29">David lit a stick of lavender incense, attempting to calm their nerves. He slid under the blanket beside Rachael. The smoke drifted into the image of the face again. As they watched, the smoke curled around the perfume bottle and the lamp.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Could it be? Do you think it’s Lilith and Samael?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“What on earth makes you think that?” David said.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Well, it’s something. Why not?”</p>
	<p class="block29">David sat quietly, forehead furrowed. “Well if it is, what do we do about it?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Well, maybe we can help them.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Help them? Are you crazy?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“No, think about it. If it is them, then we have to deal with them somehow. We have the amulet, but what if we forget to put it on the bed? What about when we have kids?” Her words rushed out before she could change her mind. “And if it is them, maybe they just want a chance to be redeemed. Wouldn’t you want a chance?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Well, how are we going to make this work? I don’t know about you, but I wasn’t taught how to revive demons in CPR class.” David scratched his head.</p>
	<p class="block29">“The vessels are made of clay. Maybe the same clay as Adam. Maybe if we pray, maybe if there is some special prayer we can say…” Her voice trailed off. She knew it sounded crazy.</p>
	<p class="block29">Lilith entered Rachael’s dreams. “A chance, our last chance.” Rachael rose from her bed and stood in front of the mantel. She lit the candles and incense. She pressed her mouth to the tiny drop of blood on the bottle, breathing in the holy perfume, sharing her breath. Lilith told Rachael the words to say, spoken in an ancient tongue.</p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block28">Ari shakes his head violently to escape the memory. Raindrops escape the gutter and keep perfect cadence on a rusty pail outside. His heart holds a less measured beat. The candle light distorts his image, his features glowing red, melting into the silver flashes from the storm.</p>
	<p class="block29">The steady dripping is hypnotic, confusing, and seems to come from inside the house. The hairs rise on the back of his neck. <i class="calibre6">The sound is behind him.</i></p>
	<p class="block29">He turns slowly, pulling the curtain back from the shower to reveal the gruesome truth. Not rain. Blood, matching cadence with the rain, splashing into a glistening pool.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Holly.” His vile mouth does not deserve to hold her name. “No, Dear God, no.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Her tender bare breasts,<span class="calibre3"> held lovingly just hours before, now slick from the recent carnage. One pink nipple is replaced with a gaping wound. The other breast wrenched from its place, now hanging from her side. Lovely fingernails are jagged and bloody, torn to the quick from fighting her attacker. Where life should have been welcomed, a wasteland spans from her breasts to the mound of her womanhood. Her ribcage glows as white as ivory, but no sweet music lives here.  Her tender abdomen gapes open; green bile floats on the remnants of her last meal. </span><i class="calibre6">Their last meal together.</i></p>
	<p class="block29">Ari rushes to the toilet, vomit building in his throat. As he kneels on the numbing floor, softness brushes his face. Her beautiful chestnut hair, vibrant in the sun just hours earlier, partially ripped from her scalp, spilling over the porcelain. Once sparkling eyes now clouded with the shroud of death, staring from inside the bowl. He scrambles against the wall and heaves between his legs.</p>
	<p class="block34">Ari crumples to the floor, reality spinning. <i class="calibre6">How could this have happened? </i>He has no memory of this. He battles to remember what had happened, but his mind surrenders once more to the memories of others.</p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block"> </p>
	<p class="block28">David woke, hearing voices. Walking into the living room, he saw a flicker of candle light from the mirror above the mantel. His mind clouded from sleep, he was confused by the two faces in the room. Rachael stood in a pink T-shirt and panties.</p>
	<p class="block34">The other woman was naked, covered partially by her flowing red hair. David shook his head. Although Rachael was the most beautiful woman he had ever known, this woman was the most erotic. Her lips were the deep red of a ripe strawberry. Every curve of her body was suited for the palm of a man’s hand, or the bow of his mouth. Her eyes reached into the pits of his desire, and he couldn’t turn away.</p>
	<p class="block29">“David. It’s okay. This is Lilith.”</p>
	<p class="block29">David stared at them. “I can’t. What if…?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“David, all they want is a chance. Just a chance, like all of the rest of us.” Rachael touched his face. “They are under very strict doctrine. They can stay here, we can help them.” He nodded his head.</p>
	<p class="block29">Rachael took David’s hand and led him to the oil lamp. A small knife pricked his finger, dropping a speck of blood into the lamp. His breath entered the opening. Lilith told him the words to say.</p>
	<p class="block29">David watched as the smoke encircled the lamp, creating a haze. He stood in disbelief as a man appeared. He was bronzed perfection, with golden hair and eyes like fire. David's hand closed around Rachael's.</p>
	<p class="block29"><span class="calibre3">Lilith moved to Samael. She held the amulet to him. Together, they spoke the words in the ancient language intended to chase the evil from them. The final words were, “Senoy, Sansenoy, and Semangelof.”  Each word expressed terror and anguish. Forcing each new breath into their bodies, their faces contorted with pain. Samael’s muscular frame withered. Lilith’s breasts melted into faded tallow, hanging from her skeleton. Crimson flesh was woven with threads of sinew. Hair thinned and fell to the floor. Wrinkles creased her perfect mouth into a gray void, filled with screams. Samael’s eyes widened, silent witness to her torture. He reached for her. As she grasped his hand, the terror stopped.  </span></p>
	<p class="block29">“What the hell just happened?’ David demanded.</p>
	<p class="block29">“The demons didn’t want to leave the vessels.” Rachael rushed to the kitchen to bring them water.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Vessels? What do you mean?” David asked</p>
	<p class="block29">“They became the vessels, just as we are vessels for God.” She turned to Samael. “Is it over?”</p>
	<p class="block29">Samael shook his head. “No, our bodies will heal, but our pain will endure.” He drank the cool water. “I must warn you. The demons are not completely gone. They are like smoke. They can be many places at once.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Lilith added, “We must prove ourselves to be worthy of God, living as flesh beings. You are very kind to allow us to stay, but none of us can be tempted. Your union is holy, but ours is not. You must keep the amulet above your bed always. Coupling with us would be disastrous to us all.”</p>
	<p class="block24"> </p>
	<p class="block33">There wasn’t supposed to be a child. None of them knew Rachael was already expecting.</p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>

	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block29">Ari leans his head forward, between his knees, ignoring the filth. The curtain on his memory rises. He forces himself to relive the night.</p>

	<p class="block29">When Holly and he arrived just hours before, he escorted her through the house, giving her a tour. She admired the hardwood floors, stone tiles, and the rock fireplace. The little prayer hands on the mantel drew her attention. “This is beautiful.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“It’s from Bethlehem. It’s made from blessed olive wood. Funny thing, I can’t touch it without getting a funny feeling in the pit of my stomach.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“And what is this?’ She touched a small piece of pottery. It was red, shaped like a leaf.</p>
	<p class="block34">“I have no idea. I don’t even know where it came from. Probably left here by the last renters. It's strange, it wasn't there before.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Are you sure?” Holly jerked her hand back. “It feels warm.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Hell yes, I'm sure. I have OCD. Remember?”</p>
	<p class="block29">His stereo system captured her attention. He invited her to choose some CD’s. “It holds five discs. Piped into every room in the house. We’ll have music all night.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Cool.” She flipped through the collection, placing discs into the player. “Oh! You have my favorite. Stevie Nicks, Wildheart. Most people love ‘Stand Back’ and the one with Tom Petty. My favorite song on here is ‘Nightbird.’ It’s so sad. It's haunting and beautiful.”</p>
	<p class="block29">She placed the disc in with the others and pushed the buttons until the song began to play. Her skirt brushed against her bare legs as she swayed, singing to the lyrics.</p>
	<p class="block29">He moved closer to her, heat rising in his loins.</p>
	<p class="block29">Stevie sings of someone walking away.</p>
	<p class="block29">He took her in his arms. “You won’t walk away, will you?”</p>
	<p class="block29">She looked up into his eyes. “No. I’m here.”</p>
	<p class="block29">He kissed her as Stevie sang.</p>
	<p class="block44">*Stevie Nicks, Wildheart.  1983.</p>

	<p class="block43"> </p>
	<p class="block29">Lilith and Samael remained with Rachael and David during the pregnancy. They decided the baby needed to remain a secret, in case something went wrong. The baby was due in November, and Lilith planned for them to be away during the birth. Although she felt none of the rages from her demon self, she feared the worst. Rachael wore the amulet during the day, and it was hung above the doorway each night.</p>
	<p class="block29">The beauty of an autumn day began with a Colorado sunrise, golden and magnificent. The two women were in the orchard picking apples, and the men were stacking wood and getting the home ready for winter. Dark clouds gathered on the crest of the mountain range, and a frigid wind whisked through the valley. Rachael reached to put the hood of her sweater over her head. She gasped as she realized the amulet wasn’t around her neck. Screams sent David racing to find it. Her labor began as the storm arrived. When he returned, Rachael lay on the ground in a pool of blood.</p>
	<p class="block29">Rain turned to icy pellets as they carried Rachael to the house. The baby was coming. There was no time to drive into town. Lilith sobbed, unable to help her friend. Samael felt a stirring in his being. Neither of them knew what they were capable of doing. They needed to get away. Grabbing Samael by the arm, Lilith ran into the blinding snow.</p>
	<p class="block29">David was left to deliver the baby and console his wife. Her unearthly screams escorted the child into the world. Her eyes saw him for too short of a time before the light went out in them.</p>
	<p class="block29">David had no time to grieve for her. The baby was not breathing.</p>
	<p class="block29">He pressed on his son’s chest repeatedly, trying to stimulate the tiny heart. He pressed his quivering lips over the cold blue ones, puffing gently. The baby’s gray eyelids snapped open, revealing an ethereal blue, but there was no light within. The spirits within reached into David’s breath and removed all life. David said one final silent prayer, not for himself, but for the child. The strength of the demons faded into submission as humanity warmed the infant’s blood. Ari took a deep breath and cried.</p>
	<p class="block29">Lilith and Samael returned to the house to discover the baby, lying between his lost parents. They recognized themselves in the baby immediately. During the sacrament which gave them life, the demons had attached themselves to Rachael’s unprotected womb. They considered killing the child, to rid the world of this concentrated evil, but Rachael and David were alive in the child as well. He was naked and shivering on the cold floor. Lilith picked him up and felt a warmth from deep within herself. She looked at Samael. He bowed his head and prayed.</p>
	<p class="block29">Consistent with all cambion, Ari did not draw a human breath until he was seven. Ari was a beautiful and brilliant child with Rachael’s blonde hair and David’s dark, muscular frame. He was unaware of his precarious perch on humanity. He was an enigma, wandering between possessing wisdom beyond his years and an incurable innocence. Ari could handle many things, but change was not one of them. Anger would press him to fits of rage, followed by amnesia. He was a paradox; he felt the heat of the Satan, but he wanted to serve God. Lilith taught him ancient meditations and prayers to control his impulses. Above all, he was required to wear the amulet at all times.</p>
	<p class="block29">She forbade him to be with girls at any cost. The dangers of any child fathered by him would be devastating. The demons would escape. As a cambion, Ari could not be killed by humans, but he could be trapped for eternity. If demons killed him, they would absorb his power, becoming stronger. Lilith and Samael would lose their chance at redemption if they lost control of the demons.</p>
	<p class="block29">When Ari became a man, he followed the regimen, thinking it held his illness in check, fearing the institution again should he fail. But once a year, the demons awoke. They waited. They watched.</p>
	<p class="block29">Lilith watched as well.</p>
	<p class="block29">Each year on the fall solstice, Ari would feel the stirrings deep inside. He would choose a woman, court her, and take her home. Ari would remove the amulet and hang it above the doorway. But the demons were already in the room. Ari’s seed would find the woman’s ripe womb. The demons would begin their work.</p>
	<p class="block29">Lilith decided long ago murder was a forgivable sin. Releasing demons upon the world was not. The demons were getting stronger, and had summoned others to join in their hunt. Madness was winning. Samael could not bear the struggle with temptation and hid himself in the home, constantly praying. <span class="tab">      </span>The evil in herself grew stronger with each passing year. Other demons were close to finding them and conspiring to gain their power. Lilith couldn’t hide Ari any longer. Ari’s soul would be lost soon if she didn’t act. She had seen him with Holly and saw his love for her. This woman was different from the others. Holly wore a necklace of silver with a stone of jade, so Lilith was unable to see inside her soul. She feared Holly was a succubus, for she held a power over Ari. She feared if this woman were to birth a child, the cambion would be more powerful than any who had walked the earth.</p>
	<p class="block29">Ari continued his regimen rather than submitting to the demonic calls through his dreams. She would not be able to release the demons through him to kill Holly. Regrettably, she made plans for what she must do. She said a prayer asking for understanding, if not forgiveness. Then she spoke the true name of God and flew into the air.</p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block29">The Nightbird had returned.</p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>

	<p class="block43"> </p>
	<p class="block28">Flickering images. Dancing. Her dress on his bedroom floor. His amulet with her necklace on the dresser. Making love to Holly. Green eyes filled with passion, trust, even love. Her hair covered his damp chest as they drifted off to sleep, music still playing in the background.</p>
	<p class="block29">Holly screaming, her flesh ripped from her, her eyes wide with disbelief and terror. She reached out for a brief glimpse of humanity, not knowing it was in vain. Humanity had no home here.</p>
	<p class="block29">Frozen veins carry the truth through his heart. All of those women, ripped to shreds by his hands. He recalls the coppery taste of their blood in his mouth. But why? He stands and staggers to the sink. He stares with horror at this man he does not know. His hand finds the drinking glass and hurls it, shattering the mirror. A violent sound escapes his throat, releasing centuries of rage and despair.</p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block33">The nightmare was real.</p>

	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block28">The owl watched Ari leave the previous morning. She returned to her human form and entered the home. Lilith placed the oil lamp on the mantel. Samael’s spirit was trapped once again by the words she had spoken, by the holy oils, and by the scrap of cotton cloth once held by Jesus. Her hand touched the lamp tenderly one last time.</p>
	<p class="block29">From the bottle in her pocket, she poured the granules into Ari's bathroom sink. The scent of garlic filled the room. She used some dried lavender to cover the poison.  If fate was kind, he would die quickly.</p>

	<p class="block43"> </p>
	<p class="block28">Ari turns on the water, splashing his face. Noxious gas rises from the sink, filling his eyes with stinging tears. Sliver edges of the mirror melt in the candlelight, curling into fascinating ribbons. They rise in a cloud of confusion, distorting the vile reality. Choking on fumes, he gropes for answers. Truth cuts through his anguish, carrying another memory.</p>

	<p class="block28">Holly fought for her life, nails digging into her attacker’s face. <i class="calibre6">His mother’s face.</i></p>
	<p class="block29">Ari grabbed his mother's long red hair, throwing her to the floor. “Mother! What are you doing?” He placed himself between the two women, pushing his mother back, to no avail.</p>
	<p class="block29">His mother screamed through her tears, “She’ll destroy us all! She’s pregnant!”</p>
	<p class="block29">Ari watched in disbelief as his mother <i class="calibre6">changed</i>. Lilith appeared behind him, wielding razor sharp weapons similar to the talons of a raptor. Evil shrieks mingled with cries for mercy. Holly's silken flesh opened with crimson threads, unraveling her essence. No demons lay within.</p>
	<p class="block29">Holly's voice trembled. “Why?”</p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>

	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block28">Ari succumbs to his grief. Sobs escape his raw throat. He has no will to attempt escape. Thick gas evicts the air from his lungs. Saliva dotted with crimson blood bubbles from his blackened lips. Rotting flesh slides down his leg, splattering onto his bare foot. Flame finds fuel, ignites. Charred skin on his hands withers to faded parchment. With an immense purge, demons vacate his soul in a fury. Repentant prayers escape on a whisper. The smoke blinds him, but not before he meets the eyes of the owl. The Nightbird leaves her perch on the aspen and flies into the night.</p>
