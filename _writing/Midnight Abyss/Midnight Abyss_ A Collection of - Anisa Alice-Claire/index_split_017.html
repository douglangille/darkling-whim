	<p class="block24"> </p>
	<p class="block24"> </p>
	<p class="block28">IF I HEAR one more idiot weatherman say ‘It’s not the heat… it’s the humidity’, I’ll shoot him— and not a merciful head shot either. As they throw the last shovelful on his grave I’ll correct him, ‘It’s both heat and humidity, brotha!’</p>
	<p class="block29">If you read a calendar hanging on any wall you’ll see it’s September, 2055. The particular day’s not important since one is much like the other. The heat is not only pervasive but constant. Back in 2010 the world became really serious about destroying itself. And naturally, the ‘world’ is defined as the human population. The planet’s other species were simply along for the ride.</p>
	<p class="block29">By 2020, Global Warming was a fact. When Alaska hit 100 degrees in December, ‘political hoax’ became a little used phrase. Winter had, by then, disappeared except in the polar caps and even there the drastic changes were felt by the resident species. In short order polar bears, arctic fox, penguins and cold water fish and mammals ceased to be. By 2030, these species were little more than postage stamp imprints. Nothing more than reminders of what once was. Everything from the Rainforests to the Polar Caps went screwy. Life as we know it is no longer life as we knew it.</p>
	<p class="block29">The ‘wave’ is in its fifth day. The typical temps of a hundred are now one hundred-and-twenty-five. And, partner, it’s a killer fifth day. </p>
	<p class="block29">The city is boiling, and people are beyond bitchy. The forecast is for more of the same, both the boiling and the bitchiness. Bad news for people watching their utility bills sky-rocket from the production of manufactured-air 24-7. But it’s worse news for poor people who have no icy air, no relief and plenty of boiling blood in over-cooked bodies. Most of those people live in my zip code.</p>
	<p class="block29">Where I’m from three meals a day is a luxury and AC is what you don’t have. Around here there are blocks of brick-front row houses soaking up the heat. The heat, radiating off the brick and concrete, is more than a little intense. It is so intense that the phrase, ‘Go to Hell’ is now a welcoming greeting. </p>
	<p class="block29">There are no breezes; they went the way of the Dodo bird. There are few ways to escape the heat, and those few require money. And some of them require lots of money. The rich are protected, the poor are roasted. Except for the grossly elevated temperatures, life has always been this way.</p>
	<p class="block29">Kids are listless, babies scream and adults are powder kegs waiting for the inevitable lit fuse.</p>
	<p class="block29">It’s 2pm and I’m escaping the brutal part of the heat on shady steps outside of Saint Bartholomew Church. Situated on the western side of the block and smack dab on one of the four corners, the building blocks direct sunlight. Thank you, Catholic Jesus! Saint Bart’s is a neighborhood mainstay. The church has a soup kitchen, nursery and compassionate priests. </p>
	<p class="block29">They throw quite a spread for those attending evening Mass on Sundays. You can bet your assets that puts quite a few non-Catholics in those pews. Hungry people are easily converted— at least until the meals are over.</p>
	<p class="block29">The Catholic Church, worldwide, has struggled to stem the suffering from the Global Warming Pandemic. The GWP has killed more people than can be counted. Disease, pestilence, weather and, of course, the elevated temperatures have turned Planet Earth into Planet Hell. The Vatican has reacted with prayer, money and more prayer. None of which worked, but at least they reacted.</p>
	<p class="block29">Many Sundays my mama had us sitting on those hard wooden benches waiting for the end of Mass so we could get our grub on. I was a mousey little kid in those days. I wore mostly second-hand clothes, ate mostly second-hand food and learned that life ain’t copasetic when your mother’s a junkie. The first rule of survival for junkies is to do what you gotta do. For my mother, a needle in the arm is the number one ‘do’. She somehow managed to keep me fed until I took over doing it at ten-years-old. At thirty-five, I’m still doin’ what’s gotta be done.</p>
	<p class="block29">In 2035, a new pestilence birthed itself in the form of an old legend. Creatures akin to zombies appeared. By 2025, intravenous drug use was favored by thirty-five percent of the population. Many of the newer users came to drugs to escape the reality of a world on its ass. It appears that when the world finally gasps its last, half the population will face the ‘final down’ on a ‘final high’.</p>
	<p class="block29">In 2028, a radical religious group packed up bags and parishioners and moved to the jungle region of Brazil. They had been headquartered in Florida. When they left most people said, ‘Now if we could just do something about the snakes’. In 2029, unknown to officials, they began distributing a new illegal drug worldwide. The drug, soon to be called ‘Chill’, gave the user a euphoric and instant high. The temperature became more symbiotic than adversarial to them. Joy of the present replaced fear of the future. </p>
	<p class="block29">Within five years, the drug had achieved its intended purpose. Working with the user’s body fluids the drug produced a condition called ‘Chill Effect'. The victims are called Chill Zombies.</p>
	<p class="block24"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block24"> </p>
	<p class="block28">Hamlet Johnson is occupying the spot next to me, and as usual philosophizing as only a career wino can. No one is sure who ‘Hamlet’ was before he became a wino, but he’s the only wino I know who regularly quotes Shakespeare. That’s how he got this street moniker.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Moses,” he says, while glancing up and down the sweltering street as though relief will pull up in a yellow cab, “people are the worst of the mammals at adapting to their environment. God gave us more brainpower than the other mammals but left out the gift of adaptation. We got no natural physical endowments to protect us from this heat. That’s why we used our brain power to invent air conditioning.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Then I wish them people-mammals would bring a few of those inventions down thisaway,” I reply.</p>
	<p class="block29">Hamlet chuckles while wiping his face with a rag that started life as a baby’s diaper. “Man’s biggest invention is money, Moses. If you ain’t got some a dat, you ain’t got nothin’.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Amen, brother. Money is the only luxury that buys other luxuries.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Of course them Chill Zombies is another thing, Moses. They want the heat. They need the heat, and they’ll keep fighting until the temperature goes to one-fifty and we go to gone.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“You got that right, Hamlet. The Chill Nation, which started out as a crazy religious group hatched a pretty insidious plan. Not only does a Chill Zombie desire the heat but, as the condition sets in, requires the heat. They no longer need or want food for sustenance. Their skin, which turns a dull red, develops cells just below the surface which transfers the heat in the air to nutrients for the body. The more heat there is, the more nutrients they get.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Hamlet nods, but I can tell this is more information than he wants. Like many people around the globe, he knows the Chill Nation has their own scientists who are constantly trying to push the Earth’s temperature to one-hundred-fifty degrees, the temperature needed to sustain a worldwide Chill Zombie population. If they cannot achieve that temperature, the Chill Zombies will begin dying off through malnutrition. </p>
	<p class="block29">Those in the Chill Nation easily number two hundred thousand. They are the leaders and the task-masters. None are Zombies, but all are fanatics. They believe that when the Earth’s temperature reaches the desired one hundred and fifty degrees, God will take them into heaven as his special angels while the Chill Zombies will serve as an Earthly army against Satan’s hordes who shall climb from Hell to claim the Earth. The Earth which Satan believes is rightly his. </p>
	<p class="block29">While the Chill Nation is waiting to ascend to heaven, they use part of their billions to build underground communities to escape the heat.</p>
	<p class="block29">In 2037, my mother became a Chill Zombie. In 2038 she died of malnutrition. A few Chill Zombies cannot even partially feed on temperatures lower than one-hundred-fifty. My mother was one. </p>
	<p class="block29">Hamlet suddenly looks serious, or at least as serious as a wino can look. “Why you still up in here, my man?”</p>
	<p class="block29">I give him my confused look. It often comes in handy. “What you mean?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“You got smarts, bro, I can tell. You were in the Chill Wars in the forties and came back in one piece. You dress like a college prof, slip in and outta street talk regularly and you polite most of the time. You don’t shoot the needle, suck the pipe or kiss the bottle so why ain’t you out there skimmin’ the rich man’s green so you can have an underground crib with cool air and a grateful dame?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“This is my home, Hamlet. It’s where I hang my hat. It’s where my daddy abandoned me, and my mamma died when I was eighteen. It’s a training ground for survival. So I got this sentimental attachment thing goin’ on.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Hamlet gives me another serious look before breaking into a grin which rearranges the constant accumulation of sweat on his face. “That’s eloquent, Mr. Moses Golden. Mighty, mighty eloquent… but total bullshit. If you don’t want to answer just say so rather than blowin’ smoke up my ass.”</p>
	<p class="block29">I smile back. “Fair enough, dude. I don’t want to answer.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Solid,” Hamlet replies. “Anyway, even with this heat you adapt pretty good to your environment. You one good mammal… and one good man!”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Bullshit, bro.” </p>
	<p class="block29">“I’m serious, man… like Shakespeare say, What a piece of work is a man, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculties, in form and moving how express and admirable, in action how like an angel, in apprehension how like a god! The beauty of the world, the paragon of animals—and yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me— nor woman neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.”</p>
	<p class="block29">A clap from me and Hamlet bows his head slightly. Beads of his sweat drop to a certain death on the hot skillet of a granite church step.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Where you work?” asks Hamlet.</p>
	<p class="block29">“I’m an accountant,” I answer.</p>
	<p class="block29">“For who?” he pushes.</p>
	<p class="block29">“I freelance,” I reply.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Where you learn that?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“It’s what I did in the Chill Wars.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Where were you at during your time in the Wars?” Hamlet asks.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Mostly in South America.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“And you were an accountant?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Yeah, brother-man. When they needed the books balanced they called on me. I’m good with that kinda stuff. It’s what I do best.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“And that’s what you did? That’s what you did while the brothas was getting’ their asses shot from hell to kingdom come by them heat-lovin’ zombies and their puppet-masters? You sat in an air-conditioned office balancin’ books?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“I did my part. The best way I could. It’s what I do best.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Right on,” said Hamlet, “You do what you gotta. You also be gone quite a bit. What up with dat?”</p>
	<p class="block29">Wanting to put an end to his questions I give him a stern look before saying, “I got clients in other places with books needing to be balanced. And what you doin’ now? Practicin’ to be a detective?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Just makin’ conversation,” he says. “Just passin’ the time. Runnin’ my mouth cools me off.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Across the street, a black ‘54 Lexus pulls up to the curb. Two young boys peel off from a crowd of five and walk over to the car. They’re dropping sweat like Hippies dropped acid almost a hundred years ago. </p>
	<p class="block29">The boys are standing outside of a cut-rate liquor store called ‘Sam’s’. Sam, the original owner, is long gone as is a string of subsequent owners. The present owner makes his cash in the lucrative Chill drug trade, and a good bet is his ownership is not on any piece of paper in any state office. </p>
	<p class="block29">The young boys standing outside are part of his drug crew, and the corner they are on is one of his more profitable markets. Chill is still a desirable product and as much as the police try, they cannot stem the trade. Many people, who would not normally shoot drugs, finally do so to escape the draining effects of the heat. This is especially true for those who cannot afford air conditioning or expensive living quarters in underground bunkers.</p>
	<p class="block29">Inside the luxury car sits Benny. Some call him ‘Fat Benny’; but never to his face. Benny owns the store, the drugs being sold and the boys slingin’ it. Benny also owns most of the corners in this section of East Baltimore. The cops never can touch Benny ‘cause Benny never touches the drugs. That’s what he hires others for. Benny is also known as ‘Murder B’. and he lives up to that name by ruthlessly ordering hits on anyone in his way. It’s hard to make a case against Benny when he makes it a short walk from being a witness to being a corpse. Crossing Benny is like injecting cancer cells. With cancer, however; there’s a better survival rate.</p>
	<p class="block29">Benny is a high-ranking member in the Army of the Chill Nation. For years he has provided the Nation with a continuing supply of cash. He’s responsible for creating millions of Chill Zombies and has recruited thousands of soldiers into the elite core of the ‘Two Hundred Thousand’.</p>
	<p class="block29">I turn to Hamlet. “How ‘bout a cold drink to do battle with this heat, dude?” Then a slight hesitation before adding, “It’s my treat.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Don’t know about a cold drink, Moses, but I sure could use a lift-me-up libation. You know— a loaf of bread, a jug of wine and thou. I’ll pass on the loaf of bread and thou— not that I’m ungrateful mind you.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Is that a Shakespeare quote?” I ask.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Nope,” he replies, “some cat name of Omar Khayyam. Thought I’d branch out a bit. Don’t pay to be too predictable.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Got that right,” I say. “How ‘bout I give you a twenty, you get me a cold Nehi Orange soda, and you get whatever suits your thirst buds and the change can stay in your bank vault.”</p>
	<p class="block29">The wino’s eyes are like saucers. “Never look a gift horse in the mouth, or anyplace else for that matter. What up with this generosity?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Workin’ my way into heaven,” I answer.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Though this be madness, yet there is method in’t.” </p>
	<p class="block29">“Shakespeare?” I ask.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Ain’t nothin’ but the truth, brother-man… nothin’ but the truth.”</p>
	<p class="block29">A wrinkled twenty goes from my pocket to Hamlet’s wet mitt, and he scoots across the softened blacktop street. I’m sure he’s already thinking of all the wine he can get with the change from that twenty. And I’m sure the windfall will ease his nervousness around the drug dealers across the street. </p>
	<p class="block29">Low-life predators usually pick on those weaker than themselves. I’ve often seen them push or trip winos just to get a laugh. Hamlet would have hesitated to go to the store if it weren’t for the thought of the change from the twenty. As Hamlet said, ‘Though this be madness…’</p>
	<p class="block29">In the poorer haunts around the country these low-life pushers are called ‘One-Fiddies’. They will never really make it into the family of the Two Hundred Thousand, and at some point they will become Chill Zombies because they will continue to live in the ‘furnace’. Eventually, like so many others, they will succumb to the brutal heat and allow the Chill to take over. The One-Fiddie street name refers to the desire for the one hundred and fifty degree nirvana. The Nation considers the One-Fiddies nothing more than disposable flunkies. Life is a chessboard and the pawns never see the final checkmate.</p>
	<p class="block29">I watch as Hamlet runs into the store without interference from the drug boys. The two boys at the Lexus barely glance up as he goes by. Both are concentrating on their boss, Benny, who is speaking to them from his partially open window.</p>
	<p class="block29">Five minutes later Hamlet comes out with his bagged wine bottle in one hand and my cold bottle of soda in the other. He’s nervous as he hurries down the three steps and hits the cracked concrete sidewalk no more than six feet from the teenage dealers.</p>
	<p class="block29">One looks in his direction and shouts, “Where you goin’ you ole smoke-hound and where you get cash for booze?”</p>
	<p class="block29">Hamlet, as I suspected, ignores him and continues moving. Winos have no rules of engagement.</p>
	<p class="block29">As he reaches the curb, he’s less than two feet from the back of the Lexus. </p>
	<p class="block29">The kid yells at him again, only louder. “Hey, old man, didn’t you hear me?”</p>
	<p class="block29">Hamlet spins towards the sound of the raised voice and, in his nervous state, stumbles. The cold and slippery bottle slides out of his hand as he reaches instinctively for the trunk of the car to steady himself. Like most winos would, he concentrates on making sure his wine bottle is secure in his other hand. The soda bottle skitters noisily across the polished trunk as his hand contacts the hot metal of the car.</p>
	<p class="block29">There are instant shouts from all the boys on the corner, and the curb-side rear door opens at the same time the driver’s door swings outward. I’m already pushing myself off the steps and moving across the street. </p>
	<p class="block29">Hamlet who has steadied himself, quickly removes his hand from the hot trunk lid. At these temps, it’s likely burned. I can’t see his eyes but have no doubt they are fixed on the two boys near the car. They look about sixteen or seventeen. Both are skinny in oversized football jerseys and too-large faded jeans. The fashion from sixty years ago still prevails. One kid has a gleam in his eye that tells me he gets off on violence yet likely isn’t seasoned enough to be a pro. He’s already got his right hand under his jersey and, dollars to doughnuts, a ‘nine’ will be in it when it comes out.</p>
	<p class="block29">Benny has made it out of the car and stands a step or two behind the young thug. He, too, has his attention fully on Hamlet. The driver of the car, a thick brother with a completely shaved head, has the look of a killer. He, unlike his boss, pays no attention to Hamlet. My bet is he dismissed Hamlet as a potential threat within seconds of getting out of the air-conditioned car. His attention is directly on me as I approach the scene. He’s sizing me up. He’s a bodyguard to Benny, and he must know his job or it wouldn’t be his. Benny is way too important to the Nation not to have the best of everything.</p>
	<p class="block29">This brother’s kind is far from rare. He’s a killer. He’s a cold, efficient and dispassionate killer. It’s in his eyes; even with his dark shades in place. He’s likely so good that the Nation rewards him with a cozy air-conditioned underground bungalow complete with a freezer full of ice cubes and other comfort items.</p>
	<p class="block29">I throw my hands up and move to the outside of Hamlet. </p>
	<p class="block29">With him between me and the car, the stage is now set.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Look brothers,” I begin, “I’m sorry about the bottle on the car. My man is a little woozy from the heat, and he slipped. If there’s damage, I’m willing to cover it.” I keep my voice calm and non-confrontational, with enough ‘shake’ in it to show fear.</p>
	<p class="block29">The young thug smells blood, and he has the gun out and pointing at Hamlet. He’s in that stance you see on rap videos from the end of the last century– arm extended and the gun held sideways. He’s probably living his life as a rap video; most of these low-life thugs do.</p>
	<p class="block29">Benny looks at me and then demands, “Who the hell are you?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Nobody,” I stutter, “just a guy from across the street. I was a year behind you in school— was in the eighth and ninth grade with your sister, Roxie.”</p>
	<p class="block29">By now the young boy is in Hamlet’s face. He’s got his gun almost in my man’s nose. Hamlet’s shaking and sweating. The sweat’s from more than just the heat. The kid’s face is part grin, part sneer and nothing resembling humanity or compassion.</p>
	<p class="block29">I’ve seen this all before. So many times in so many places I’ve seen this before. These are jackals trying to be lions. They envision easy prey, helpless prey, and so they bare their fangs. The mind-set is one of the reasons humanity is in this sorry state. At the turn of the century, the once proud lions on the planet became jackals. They went after easy prey. They fed on the half-dead. They thought only of themselves, devouring not only the flesh of the weak, but their own. The world, over time, became a giant roasting pan. The jackals of the world thought themselves cooks, but soon found out they were inside the pan also. </p>
	<p class="block29">As for Benny, he finally nods his head as recognition eventually takes hold. He’s dressed in a loud Hawaiian style shirt, big and loose. His pants are neatly pressed black silk with pleats in the front. He has a pair of black sandals strapped on his feet, and the pants length is just right to gently break the creases. All in all he’s a plus-size GQ mannequin. But, a very dangerous one.</p>
	<p class="block29">“I don’t like people messin’ up my ride,” he says.</p>
	<p class="block29">“It was an accident,” I reply, “He didn’t mean to do it.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Can’t the alky talk for himself?” Benny asks.</p>
	<p class="block29">“He’s scared,” is my quick reply.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Should be,” Benny says as he stands next to his young gunny. “I should have Peanut here put a bullet in both your brains.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Hamlet moans quietly and looks down at the ground. Perhaps he’s praying or maybe just waiting for a bullet to crash into his brain. Or he could be doing both.</p>
	<p class="block29">I glance over at the bodyguard who’s watching this scene with dispassion. He has not pulled his gun out thinking the situation is under control, and his boss is in no danger. He doesn’t see Hamlet as a threat. To him, he’s another stumblebum wino. And from the look he gives me I’m just a chump with his hands in the air praying I won’t get shot.</p>
	<p class="block29">He’s likely right about Hamlet, but he’s made a mistake in his assessment of me. In this kind of business mistakes are both deadly and costly.</p>
	<p class="block29">I suddenly swing my left hand down and grab the gun-hand of the young punk. In the same motion, I twist his hand violently causing him to release the weapon as he yelps in pain. I grab the gun and swing quickly towards the bodyguard.</p>
	<p class="block29">He proves to be quick. He reaches for his gun and has it cleared from his belt in seconds. He’s quick but not quick enough. The bullet from my ‘borrowed’ gun enters his brain before his own weapon is half raised.  He ‘ragdolls’ to the ground as I swing the gun and pull the trigger a second time. The youngster drops without a sound. A quick glance tells me the major threat is leaking blood and brains in the street. The hot and softened blacktop is frying both. If the gunster has an underground bungalow, he won’t be needing it anymore.</p>
	<p class="block29">The other boys ran as soon as the first shot was fired. Survival of the swiftest replaces the fittest. They aren’t paid killers, they’re slingers of dope. Recognizing one’s limitations is a sound survival tactic.</p>
	<p class="block29">I figure Benny isn’t armed. He makes no move so I must figure right. Hamlet seems dazed and disoriented, but continues to hold his bottle of wine. Practice makes perfect. I gently push him aside as I point the gun directly at Benny.</p>
	<p class="block29">“What the hell you doin’?” he asks.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Balancing the books,” I say.</p>
	<p class="block29">“What you mean?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“You’ve been an asset to the Nation, Fat Benny. I’m moving you out of that column.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“I’ll simply be replaced by another member.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Job security for me, Fat Man. I’ll be waiting for your replacement.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Who are you?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Your sister Roxie’s classmate.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Bullshit.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Check the school records. Oh wait. This is the end of the story for you. The only checking you’ll do is to check out.” My smile, though genuine, is still mocking.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Why are you doing this?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Benny, Benny, Benny. It beats a nine-to-five.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“How about we make a deal?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“My boss don’t like me freelancing. Doin’ deals on the side is freelancin’. Besides, he’s pissed off at you and the Nation.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Benny wipes the sweat from his eyes and then says, “Hey! Why aren’t you sweating in this heat?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“I’m acclimated.”</p>
	<p class="block29">I can see he’s puzzled, and I don’t see the logic in more conversation, so I shoot him twice in the chest. He drops. I pull my cell phone from my pocket and dial 911. The first cops show up in minutes. It pays to have a mayor who insists on promptness and professionalism from his boys in blue. I gently put the young gunny’s weapon on the ground and slowly raise my hands. Hamlet watches me as though I’m from another planet and the mother ship might be arriving at any minute.</p>
	<p class="block24"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block24"> </p>
	<p class="block28">An hour has passed, and I’m cooling my heels in a police cruiser. Given the brutal temperature outside, this air-conditioned cruiser isn’t a bad place to be. The first uniformed cop on the scene placed my hands behind my back and put me in handcuffs. Five minutes later, after being seated on the curb, a uniformed sergeant stood me up and removed the cuffs but only to put my hands in front and re-cuff me before sliding me into the cruiser. He told me this would be more comfortable until a detective arrives to take my statement. That was mighty considerate of him given I just littered the street with three dead bodies.</p>
	<p class="block29">Twenty minutes later a smartly dressed young detective named Foster takes my statement. I tell him everything… except the truth. Hamlet had tripped on the curb after coming out of the store. He had accidentally hit their car. They got mad and pointed guns at him. I’d been sitting on the church steps and came over to see if I could calm everyone down. No one calmed down. The young kid— the dead one— tried to shoot Hamlet. I wrestled his gun from him and shot in self-defense. I had to shoot the big man because he had his gun out and threatened to kill me. The third man, the fat one in the Hawaiian shirt, also had a gun, and he fired it at me and missed. I shot him twice before he could shoot again. He became the third dead man.</p>
	<p class="block29">I leave out the part about my setting the whole thing up or that I expected everything to happen pretty much as it did and for Hamlet to react pretty much as he did. </p>
	<p class="block29">I told Hamlet I was an accountant in the Chill Wars and continued as a freelancer when I got back. I told him I balanced books for a living. And I do but only for my boss and it usually entails killing someone, or a group of someone’s, to make corrections. I use bullets instead of erasers. Perhaps contract killer is a more fitting word than ‘accountant’ but accountant sounds so much more civilized and, after all, in a way I do settle accounts. Euphemisms make life so much easier to digest. </p>
	<p class="block29">Fat Benny got on my list because Fat Benny, like all my other ‘corrections’ pissed my boss off. My boss felt the Nation was freelancing on his turf. Their religion is skewed and their logic isn’t. So now Fat Benny’s not around anymore. Planting a weapon on Benny after he was dead completed the scene. And so another set of books balanced, and another account closed. My boss prefers I work in secret. No need to broadcast our work. We prefer the shadows. There’s no need to burden this detective with something as inconsequential as the truth.</p>
	<p class="block29">And while I’m on the subject of the truth, there may have been a thing or two that I’ve left out. Somewhere in my younger years, when my mother found herself in a jail cell, and when heroin had her in its grip, she found herself going through torturous withdrawal. She screamed out, in the dark and cold of that clinging cell, for help from God. She screamed and screamed, begged and begged but to no avail. She heard no answering voice until she finally heard a whispered reply.</p>
	<p class="block29">‘Missy,’ it said. ‘I am here.’</p>
	<p class="block29">‘Who are you?’ she asked.</p>
	<p class="block29">‘Who would you like me to be?’</p>
	<p class="block29">‘My savior,’ my mother groaned.</p>
	<p class="block29">‘And so I shall be,’ this whispering voice said.</p>
	<p class="block29">‘Take away this pain, this hunger, and this need.’</p>
	<p class="block29">‘Oh I shall,’ replied the voice, ‘I most certainly shall, but only the pain. You must keep the hunger and the need. Without it your life has no meaning, no direction and no worth.’</p>
	<p class="block29">‘Then take the pain. Please take it now!’</p>
	<p class="block29">‘I shall, child. But first we must bargain. You give to me and so shall I give to you.’</p>
	<p class="block29">‘Give you what, My God. What can I give you?’</p>
	<p class="block29">‘I am not your God.’</p>
	<p class="block29">‘Then you are…’</p>
	<p class="block29">‘Speak not of names, Missy, but rather of gifts. Do you not pain? Am I not here to release you?’</p>
	<p class="block29">My mother moaned. ‘You want my soul.’</p>
	<p class="block29">‘Of course not,’ it whispered with its voice wrapped in a sneer. ‘I want the soul of your son, Moses.’</p>
	<p class="block29">‘My son?’ She whispers as though a louder voice on her part will make it so. ‘I can’t do that. I can’t give you his soul.’</p>
	<p class="block29">‘Of course you can. I can’t take his soul until he dies and he’s now but a child. He has his whole life ahead of him. By the time he’s reached the end, who knows what will have happened. Maybe if he leads a good life there might be intervention.’</p>
	<p class="block29">‘You mean…?’</p>
	<p class="block29">‘Far stranger things have happened. You want to be free of this pain. I will make it immediate. Moses has his life ahead of him. He’s a child.’</p>
	<p class="block29">‘My mother whimpered like a puppy. ‘Will you swear to it?’</p>
	<p class="block29">‘Swear to what, Missy Golden?’</p>
	<p class="block29">‘That you won’t take his soul until he’s dead.’</p>
	<p class="block29">The voice whispered gently. ‘I swear I won’t take Moses’ soul until he’s dead.’</p>
	<p class="block29">The next day a delivery truck hit me, and dragged me fifty feet before spitting me out like an annoying bit of gristle. </p>
	<p class="block29">Sometime later a medical examiner pronounced me dead.</p>
	<p class="block29">Satan sent me back, and I continued my life as though I was alive. The Chill Nation will not succeed. The two hundred thousand will not go to Heaven… or Hell. My boss has a special pit waiting for them. </p>
	<p class="block29">The temperature will hit one hundred-and-fifty. Life as we know it will end on this spinning ball. The next Garden of Eden will have a different Adam and Eve. This time the boss won’t need a serpent in there.</p>
	<p class="block29">I am here to do my Master’s bidding, and I will until the time is right not to. After all, that’s what double agents do. And I am Moses Golden… am I not?</p>

	<p class="block28">“I don’t know why they lost their tempers and wanted to kill Hamlet. All he did was fall on the car,” I say to the detective. “It must be the heat. It drives people crazy.”</p>
	<p class="block37">Foster looks up from the small notepad he’d been writing in and replies, “It’s not the heat… it’s the humidity.”</p>
