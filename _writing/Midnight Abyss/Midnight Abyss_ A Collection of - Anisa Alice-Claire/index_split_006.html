	<p class="block28">THE EARLY MORNING sun peeked through the curtains, and the radio alarm clock played on low volume.  Noise sensitivity had been a life-long struggle for Sarah, and waking to anything loud completely ruined her day. Her mother bought the clock radio to soothe her little girl’s tantrums, and twenty years later, Sarah still used it.</p>
	<p class="block29">Sliding her legs over the edge of the bed, Sarah wiggled her feet into her worn slippers and stood to leave. Shaking the last remnants of sleep from her mind, she<span class="calibre3"> headed for the staircase, unaware of the rubber dog toy that lay in her path until it connected with her foot.  Arms flailing, she over-corrected and slid across the newly waxed hardwood floor.  The stairway railing provided a jarring end to this undignified mode of transportation.  Taking a deep breath, she braced herself then turned to investigate.</span></p>
	<p class="block29">Sarah lived by routine, some people would go so far as to call her actions obsessive compulsive. To her, that wasn’t the case. She simply liked things to be neat and tidy, everything just seemed easier that way. As she grabbed the stuffed duck from the floor, the memory of cleaning it up immediately came back to her.</p>
	<p class="block29">The dog had four toys: the duck, the ball, the rope, and the rubber bone—exactly in that order. Duck, ball, rope and bone. There’s no way she’d forget to put the duck away if she’d put the other three in the basket on the shelf above the crate. It just wasn’t possible.</p>
	<p class="block29">Arriving at the kennel, Sarah discovered the ball, the rope and the rubber bone exactly where she’d left them the night before. Panic set in. How could this have happened? <i class="calibre6">No, no, no. This can’t happen. Not again.</i> She stopped, took ten deep breaths, and then continued to the stairs, on the verge of losing control.</p>
	<p class="block29">The thought of the duck being in the wrong place disturbed Sarah’s routine, and she had to fight<span class="calibre3"> the idea of canceling her whole day.   No good would come from her staying home. In fact, it would only make the situation worse. So, like a robot, sh</span>e methodically prepared for departure.</p>
	<p class="block29"><i class="calibre6">Turn burner dial, fill kettle, swish three times.  Place on stove facing left. Eat apple, make sandwich, brush hair.  Grab keys from hook and go to bus stop. Repeat list three times then start</i>. She repeated the list three times out loud and then began the process. If the steps were laid out, things would just be easier.</p>

	<p class="block28">Lily paced back and forth<span class="calibre3">.  </span><i class="calibre6">I know that crazy bitch is in here. Where the fuck is she? I saw her on the bus again today, and she was staring at me. Just staring, like she knew who I was or something. She doesn’t have a fucking clue. Fuck her.</i></p>
	<p class="block29">Lily hated being the center of attention; she hated even being noticed. If she could have it her way, she would just melt into the cracks of the seats on the bus. That would suit her just fine. Leaving the house made her nauseous, but she had to make a living somehow. Social Services would only help with living expenses if they had an evaluation from the doctor, but Lily refused to comply. Instead, she suffered through every painstaking minute of every painstaking day… trudging on like a soldier.</p>
	<p class="block29">After waiting all afternoon, and then late into the night, Lily came over to Sarah’s house. Tonight, she would kill Sarah. She would find the irritating nametag that nosey busybody wore all the time, and she would burn it. Then she would trash the whole house just because she knew it would make that prying bitch’s skin crawl, even after she was dead. <i class="calibre6">Fuck, Sarah. Fuck her. I can’t stand that stupid bitch.</i></p>
	<p class="block29">Ideas toiled back and forth in Lily’s mind on how to kill Sarah. She’d been planning this for a long time, except whenever she came to see it through, Sarah disappeared. Lily couldn’t figure it out for the life of her. She knew Sarah’s schedule inside and out because she sat, night after night, watching her from the bushes in Sarah’s backyard.  The view allowed Lily to peer<span class="calibre3"> into the majority of the windows facing the back of the house.  She watched Sarah’s evening cleaning routine while she downed a bottle of Gin, her favorite </span>kind of hard liquor. Nothing ever changed. Not ever. That is, until she came to kill her.</p>
	<p class="block29">Silently, Lily slid Sarah’s kitchen window open, knowing the paranoid bitch only ever left that particular one unlocked. Leaving the lights off, she found her way to the staircase then crept up the stairs. With every step she grew more excited. The time had finally come, she felt in her soul. Reaching the top, she stopped to catch her breath. All she had to do now was walk into the bedroom and smother Sarah with a pillow then all of the daily anxiety would be gone. The bus would once again be hers, and she’d finally be able to ride in peace.</p>
	<p class="block29">When Lily rounded the corner, her heart raced, and she let out a tiny giggle. The blankets were in a mound on the bed, formed in the shape of a human body. Lily proceeded. Hovering over the side, she ever-so-slowly grabbed an unused pillow and lifted it over Sarah. With all her force, Lily slammed the pillow down, expecting to hit Sarah’s face. Sarah wasn’t there.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fucking fuck!” Lily wailed into the darkness. “This isn’t happening. No, no, no.  This can’t be happening. Not again.”</p>
	<p class="block24"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block"> </p>
	<p class="block28">Sarah stumbled out of bed the next morning feeling unwell. She forgot about her slippers and went straight to the living room instead of the kitchen. She looked disheveled, and her knees and elbows were bruised. After collecting her thoughts, Sarah made breakfast. Opening the door to the freezer, she pulled out a bottle of vodka and poured it into a tall, ice-filled glass. In one gulp, she downed the liquid fire.</p>
	<p class="block29">Next, Sarah brewed a pot of coffee. Even in her altered state, she managed to place precisely four spoons of sugar into the steaming, hot cup. Only this time, she topped it up with Kahlua. Standing in one spot, Sarah lifted the mug to her mouth to sip. Lift, sip.  Lift, sip… until it was gone. Immediately after returning the cup to the sink, Sarah collapsed, head bouncing off the corner of the counter on the way down. The whole room spun, as she crawled to the phone.</p>
	<p class="block29">Sarah woke in the hospital.</p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block"> </p>
	<p class="block28">“Sarah? Are you awake?” A strange voice asked.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Yes? Yes, I think so,” Sarah managed to say.</p>
	<p class="block29">“You took a pretty big spill in your kitchen and knocked yourself out. Do you remember anything?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“I remember drinking coffee, but that’s all. I drank the coffee and then felt dizzy.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Okay, that’s good. At least you’re recalling some of it. Don’t worry, dear. The rest will come back to you eventually. Just give it some time.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Sarah saw that the strange voice came from a nurse standing beside the bed, changing an I.V. bag. “Try and get some rest. I’ll be back in a bit to check on you. Would you like me to phone someone? Nobody was listed as an emergency contact… ”</p>
	<p class="block29">“No, that’s fine. I live by myself.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Alright, I’ll be back to check on you soon.”</p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block"> </p>
	<p class="block28">Lily stared into the mirror, face skewed. Blood dripped from where the I.V. needle was just moments ago. Red spots speckled her nose from the tape on the tubes she’d ripped out, and her head pounded.  She turned to shut the door beside her, locking it when it clicked closed.</p>
	<p class="block29"><i class="calibre6">How did I get here?</i> Lily stood, staring at her reflection. Her vision doubled, so she blinked, attempting to clear it. When she opened her eyes, a different face stared back at her. Lily nearly jumped from her skin. <i class="calibre6">Sarah</i>.</p>
	<p class="block29">Sarah gasped, touching the mirror. She’d seen that face before but couldn’t quite place<span class="calibre3"> where. Grabbing a piece of Kleenex, Sarah dabbed the blood dripping down her arm then twisted the tap handles so she could wet her face.  The cold water felt good</span> on her burning skin. Sarah lifted her head, returning it to the reflection in the mirror. What stared back wasn’t Sarah.</p>
	<p class="block29">Lily slammed her fists on the edge of the sink, screaming at the top of her lungs, “Get out of here! Get out of here! You have no right being here. Leave this fucking instant, you stupid bitch!”</p>
	<p class="block29">Sarah watched the image in the mirror thrash around. She saw the other woman’s lips moving, like she was yelling something. Sarah took a step back, reaching for the door handle. She heard the nurse on the other side telling her to unlock the door.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Leave now. Leave <i class="calibre6">right</i> now! Get out of here,” Lily yelled, froth building at the corners of her mouth. Being in public, she didn’t want to kill her, but Sarah wouldn’t leave.  She knew what she had to do next. Witnesses or not, and without thinking, she smashed her fists into the mirror, exploding the glass on impact.</p>
	<p class="block29"> “Sarah? Are you okay? What’s happened? Talk to me Sarah, open the door, please!” The nurse shouted from the other side.</p>
	<p class="block29">Lily snatched a shard from the ground and slid it across Sarah’s throat. “You demented bitch! Why were you always staring at me? WHY? Just tell me <i class="calibre6">why</i>,” Lily cried out.</p>
	<p class="block29">The door crashed open, and the frantic nurse came flying in. Sarah was covered in blood, her eyes rolled to the back of her head as she took a deep, trembling breath.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Sarah, listen to me.  Put that glass down, okay?”</p>
	<p class="block29">Lily burst out laughing. She laughed so hard her throat gurgled. She laughed and laughed some more.  Tears rolled down her cheeks. Then, in her final attack, she sliced Sarah’s wrists to ensure Sarah wouldn’t survive.</p>
	<p class="block29">Sarah’s head fell back, grip loosened, and the shard of glass fell from her hand, clanking as it landed beside her on the floor.</p>
