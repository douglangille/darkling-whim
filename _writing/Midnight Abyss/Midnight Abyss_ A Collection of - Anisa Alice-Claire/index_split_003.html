	<p class="block14">IT ALL STARTED in a bar one lonesome, stormy October night. Greg and Shaun compared battle wounds and old exes while nursing watery beer. Their blurry eyes were set on a pair of off-duty vixens. Kelleigh and Anisa played at a demure ignorance from across the stale, smoke-filled room. Reconsidering their chances, the ladies summoned them over with a bottle of rum and a few cheap cigars.</p>
	<p class="block15">The boys struggled to stand, and it took a few moments for the world to right itself. With a shot of courage, they made their play.</p>
	<p class="block15">Suddenly, there was a thwap-whump-whump of the saloon doors as Matt strode in. “Is he here?” he asked, furious and crazed. The scimitar he brandished was soiled with dried blood.</p>
	<p class="block15">"Who the hell are you looking for?" grumbled Jennifer from underneath her dusty felt hat. She placed her six-shooter on the table with a deliberateness that only the foolish would fail to heed.</p>
	<p class="block15">"Me," said Doug from behind the bar. "The maggot is here for me."</p>
	<p class="block15">Everyone stared as he slowly finished wiping the last of the glasses, folded the cloth and reached for his trusty shotgun. It was show time.</p>
	<p class="block15">A crash echoed through the building as a rent in the seedy joint’s roof opened up. A cloud of over-sized bats flew in followed by the monstrosity of a troll known as Ray. He landed squarely on the table, eager for a fight.</p>
	<p class="block15">Bright lights shone from below as Theresa rose from her crypt, her angelic fire sparking from fingertip to fingertip in anticipation.</p>
	<p class="block15">The assembled group looked at each other and someone said:</p>
	<p class="block15">"Let’s write a book."</p>
	<p class="block16">To be continued…</p>
