	<p class="block20">Anisa A. Claire</p>
	<p class="block24"> </p>
	<p class="block24"> </p>
	<p class="block28">I AWOKE COVERED in warm blankets. The pain in my stomach had disappeared, but the smell of frying meat saturated the air, stirring my hunger. <i class="calibre6">Nothing made sense.</i> My head was fuzzy, but certain things stuck in my memory. The lakes drying up and the plants wilting couldn’t have been a dream. The memories were too vivid. Yet, a glass of water sat beside me, and vegetables hung from the tent ceiling, drying. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Where do you come from, girl?” a low voice echoed in my ears. I jumped back, gasping.</p>
	<p class="block29">“W-who are you?” I asked, trying not to sound afraid. “Show yourself.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Extend to me this simple courtesy, for it was I who saved your life. So, let me ask again. Where do you come from, girl?” The voice seemingly came from nowhere, but at the same time, came from everywhere.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Hazleton,” I answered in one big exhale. “I came from Hazleton.”  If the person at the other end of the voice spoke the truth, my debt was much larger than a simple answer in exchange for my life.</p>
	<p class="block29">Mist materialized from the shadows, wrapping through and around itself. Stretching up and out, piece by piece, until it formed into an elderly woman before my eyes. Pressed up against the tent as far as I could manage, I observed every inch of her. She remained semi-transparent, though fully visible. Her wrinkled hands and the ageing around her warm eyes made me guess her to be around eighty years old. White hair flowed down her back, trailing a few inches behind her bare, callused feet.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Child,” she whispered, approaching me. “Your sweet soul is compromised. Are you aware of this?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Compromised?” </p>
	<p class="block29">“There is a darkness set deep within you, shrouding my vision.  I cannot see beyond it. Something laid claim to you, and it’s hanging on like a leech to a wound.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“D-darkness? I don’t understand. What horrible things are you suggesting? I’m a little hungry, very tired, but nothing more than that. I’m fine. Really.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“A man in your life,” the old woman said, staring directly into my eyes, “he drank, no?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“My father, yes, I was told he drank himself to an early grave.” </p>
	<p class="block29">“This man, he is the one responsible for the plague you carry within you. After your mother parted from this world, he sold you. Whoever bought you is an evil force, something far worse than I’ve ever encountered.” She placed her soft hand tightly over mine, and when she did, my heart pulsed. I struggled to regain composure. “There’s never been a darkness I couldn’t see through. Not until you, sweet child.” </p>
	<p class="block29">“How do you know all of this?” I inquired gently, not wanting to upset the lady who so kindly took me in, but also not believing what she’d just said. Magic and darkness, comprised souls. Smart people stayed away from this kind of talk, kept their nose to the ground, their minds out of danger. Not me, though. Not this time. I needed to know more. Longed to know more. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Visions, child,” she replied, matter-of-factly. “This curse has been with me since birth, and has followed me into the approaching days of death.” </p>
	<p class="block29">“Do you know who placed this darkness inside of me? You said my father sold me, but who actually planted it there?” I had a difficult time remembering my father by this point. I didn’t know much about him, and what memories remained were hazy at best. I often wondered if they were memories at all or if I’d just heard a particular story so many times that I’d turned it into a memory.</p>
	<p class="block29">“I cannot see far enough past it to reveal the identity of the capture. It is someone you know very well.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“I’ve only ever known one person well, his name is Teival. He took care of us orphans when nobody else would. Our conditions were less than fair at the best of times, but Teival did all he could for us.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Teival, you say?” The old woman stopped to clear her throat. “Listen. I will feed you, and give you clothing, but then you must be on your way. This is no place for a child such as yourself, and I am not equipped to properly care for you. You must keep moving, Elodie. Never stop.” The old woman turned around in what seemed like an attempt to end the conversation. The mention of Teival scared her, chilled her to her core. </p>
	<p class="block29">The hairs on the back of my neck stood up. “I never told you my name.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Of course you did, child. It was but a reflection from your mind’s eye.” Her soft gaze chased away any feelings of uncertainty. “I mean you no harm,” she promised. </p>
	<p class="block29">“But there’s nothing out there for me. No food or water, no people. Or at least there won’t be,” I pleaded with the woman, but she didn’t want to hear me. She couldn’t hear me. Her mind was already made up.  I needed to leave.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Just keep moving. Steer clear of any of those orphans you grew up with. Do you hear me?”</p>
	<p class="block29">I glanced to the ground, nodding. Something about her made me want to listen. She’d just warned me against my brother and sister, and deep down, I knew she was right. They needed to be avoided at all costs. </p>
	<p class="block29">The woman scurried around the tent, cramming different items into a large, leather sack. She took the deer meat from the fire, handing it to me on a wooden block, and then pulled a trunk from under the bed and lifted the lid. Inside laid a pile of material. She sifted nearly to the bottom before pulling out a stack of greens, browns and oranges. With a flick of the wrist they turned into a pair of pants, a shirt, and a warm looking jacket.</p>
	<p class="block29">“These will keep you from freezing and hopefully help you blend in a little better,” she said, handing me the garments. “You’ll be faced with many a challenge, child. It is the way life must be for you. Never give up. Do you understand?”</p>
	<p class="block29">Again, though I wanted to say so much more, all I could muster was a simple, “Yes, ma’am.”</p>
	<p class="block29">After changing, I filled my stomach with food and water. The old woman wasted no time sending me on my way. I didn’t want to go. The affection she’d shown me was the closest I’d ever come to real compassion. However, I refused to burden the old woman and left without further complaint.</p>
	<p class="block29">The last thing my savior said to me was, “Head East, child, to the shores of Rupert. You will find what you are looking for there.” I’d never been to Rupert before but heard many great things about it. An abundant amount of water flowed through the riverbeds, plants grew wild and animals roamed free. Though I hadn’t known her long, I trusted her.</p>
	<p class="block29">Every day I walked as far as my small feet would carry me, and slowly, mile by mile, the landscape began to change. The further I went, the more food became available. A few berries hung from bushes speckling the sides of the trails, mushrooms sprouted from tree bases. The weather normalized. The storms became fewer, but still, there were no clean water sources available.</p>
	<p class="block29">After an especially long, grueling day, I set up camp under the protection of a small dugout in the base of a boulder, falling asleep as soon as I rested against my backpack.</p>
	<p class="block29">I awoke to whispers in my head, echoing back and forth in an incoherent fashion. Stop, stop! I screamed silently. I’d drunk enough water and knew I wasn’t hallucinating. Despite my inner pleas, the voices continued, zooming in and out like a bee seeking honey.</p>
	<p class="block33">Where i-s-s she? I know she’s close.</p>
	<p class="block33">Yeah, real close. Wait until she sees what we have in store for he-r-r-r</p>
	<p class="block29">Springing from the hole, I stumbled through the forest and ran until I could run no more. The voices faded then became stronger, then faded, and then got stronger. Finally, they were so loud my own voice became muted. A searing pain encased my trembling body. My chest felt like it had ruptured, I clutched it, dropping to the ground. Sweat poured from my brow, and I could hardly form a thought, let alone push words out of my mouth.</p>
	<p class="block29"><i class="calibre6">Here… Here… Here… She’s HERE</i>.</p>
	<p class="block29">The bushes in front of me rustled and from them emerged two bodies. Behind them, tied to a rope, another figure followed. Rubbing my eyes, I blinked, and Ollie, Fatima and the old woman who helped me a few days ago came into focus.</p>
	<p class="block33">Stay strong, child, if you can hear me… please stay strong. Fall not to their temptations, no matter how much you want to.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Ollie? Fatima? Is that you?” I asked, slowly gathering the strength to stand.</p>
	<p class="block29"><i class="calibre6">Of course it’s us, fool.</i> Ollie’s voice was loud and clear, but his lips never moved. Hollow green eyes stared back at me.</p>
	<p class="block29">“What are you doing with that woman?”</p>
	<p class="block33">Teival sent us. </p>
	<p class="block29">“I don’t understand. Why aren’t your lips moving when you speak? I can hear you, but it’s all in my head.”</p>
	<p class="block33">Too many questions, all of which will be answered later. In the meantime, we have a situation to deal with. This woman practices sorcery against the wishes of Teival. Sorcery is a threat to our father, and what threatens him must die. Prove that you’re with us, Elodie. Put this woman to death.</p>
	<p class="block29">“I—What? This woman saved me, Ollie. I won’t repay her kindness with death. Have you lost your mind? Teival wouldn’t condone this kind of behavior. Let her go this instant.” I took a step forward to test his reaction. He didn’t appear to notice. “What’s gotten into you?”</p>
	<p class="block33">You have no choice. The witch has been warned, but she continues to conduct magic. If you don’t kill her, we will. And trust me when I say, it won’t be pretty.</p>
	<p class="block33">Stay strong, child. I’ve lived a long, full life. I am ready to leave this world.</p>
	<p class="block29">My stare shifted from Ollie to the woman. Her wrists bled where the rope cut in, her once-warm face dripped with signs of exhaustion. Puffy, black bags surrounded her eyes, and sections of her hair had been hacked off.  It was a horrifying sight.</p>
	<p class="block29">At the time, I didn’t know how to speak to her the way she spoke to me. I didn’t want to put her at risk of encountering more harm by revealing her ability to communicate with me in the same way Ollie and Fatima could. I wanted nothing more than to tell her to run, to not give up, and to never look back. I wanted to tell her it was okay. That I knew Ollie and Fatima, and I wouldn’t allow them to hurt her any more than they already had. But I couldn’t tell her anything. All I could do was listen.</p>
	<p class="block33">Well, Elodie? What are you waiting for?</p>
	<p class="block29">“Ollie, what are you doing? Surely Teival will understand once I explain how much she helped me.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Without hesitation, Ollie turned and whaled on the old woman, and in hardly a glimpse, his face contorted, twisting into a vacant gaze. He punched her in the stomach, the head. Fatima ran around her in circles, smacking her with a stick, a hint of pleasure splashed across her porcelain face.</p>
	<p class="block29">“No, please! What are you doing? Let her go. Give me a chance to speak with Teival,” I screamed.</p>
	<p class="block29">They didn’t acknowledge my existence. Instead, they continued with the thrashing, beating the old woman over and over again, all the while chanting a familiar childhood song.</p>
	<p class="block33">Ring-around-the-rosie, pocket full of posies. Hush-ah… Hush-ah… </p>
	<p class="block29">I tried to run to the helpless woman, but something stopped me in my tracks. A force beyond my comprehension pushed back at me.</p>
	<p class="block33">We all fall down!</p>
	<p class="block33">No, child! Don’t come near me. If you touch me while I’m dying your fate will be their fate. Don’t give these child reapers what they want. Sta.. str—</p>
	<p class="block33">Ring-around-the-rosie…</p>
	<p class="block29">Tears flooded my face. I couldn’t let the woman die, but at the same time, I needed to honor her final wishes. </p>
	<p class="block33">Pocket full of posies…</p>
	<p class="block29">“Fatima, please listen to me. Teival will understand, he’ll be merciful, just let her go,” I sobbed. “Let her go, please, Fatima.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Ollie and Fatima continued until the old woman lay in a heap on the ground, blood pouring from her body. Long after she’d stopped breathing, they kept kicking her. Hush-ah! Hush-ah! They chanted as Ollie grabbed the front of her neck and dug his fingernails into her flesh. He looked up at me, flashing a crooked grin, and in one quick movement, ripped her throat out and tossed it to the side.</p>
	<p class="block29"><i class="calibre6">We all fall down.</i> This time he mouthed the words I heard in my head. His pale cheeks rising and falling with every word.</p>
	<p class="block29">I screamed and fell to the ground, clawing at the air in front of me, desperately trying to get to her dead, limp body. What I remembered most were her eyes staring at me the entire time. Those once beautiful, caring eyes soon became glazed and lifeless. When I reached her, I placed a shaky hand on her shoulder, knowing she’d already left this world. A surging pain pounded through my chest, knocking the wind out of me and causing me to stumble. I collapsed on top of her.</p>
	<p class="block33">Go on then, Elodie. Run. Run as fast as you want, but never forget… We’ll take from you until there is nothing left to take. Everything you love will suffer. Even the lands will suffer. Just as they have back in Hazleton. You’ll see. You’ll see how Teival reacts when his children don’t obey him.</p>
	<p class="block29">Ollie giggled, turning his fair, freckled face to Fatima. The twins linked arms and skipped off into the bushes. Fatima’s dark pigtails bounced up and down off of her slight shoulders while Ollie lifted his feet from the ground, clicking his heels together in the air.</p>
	<p class="block29">Remembering the old woman’s words, I swore to be strong for her. My soul may have been compromised, as she said, but over her dead body would I allow them to take my heart. I knelt beside her and closed her eyes. Tears flowed freely, I couldn’t help myself. My shoulders shook as I sobbed uncontrollably. <i class="calibre6">Nothing made sense. </i>Fatima and Ollie were family. They were innocent orphans who grew up in the alleys of Hazelton. Just like me.</p>
	<p class="block29">The moon glowed overhead, and leaves rustled in the distance. The near-silence calmed me, and I fell into a deep slumber, curled up beside the old woman. I couldn’t bear to leave her alone on the eve of her death. Her murder played out in my head on repeat. How could I have just stood idle, watching them beat her to death? Were Fatima and Ollie really the epitome of evil? They couldn’t be. I knew them.</p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block28"><span class="calibre3">The next morning, I departed the murder scene a changed person. Still a child, but no longer naïve to the ways of the world.  I needed to find Teival… to set things straight. If he was the mastermind pulling the puppet strings for Ollie and Fatima, he would pay.  Finding him wasn’t going to be easy, though. Before, he seemed to appear whenever I thought about him. I’d never really known where to look for him, per se. That’s the way it had </span>always been, and now with Hazelton gone, he could literally be anywhere. That left only one logical option, I had to find Fatima and Ollie in order to get to Teival.</p>
	<p class="block29">Living in the streets taught survival skills, but more importantly for this situation, it taught me how to track people. I set out in the direction Ollie and Fatima disappeared to after tearing the old woman’s throat out. After walking for a while, I realized there was no sign of them. It was almost like they were ghosts. No footprints, no scuffs in the dirt, not even broken twigs or left behind food remnants. I sat on the ground in an exasperated huff. They had to have left something behind, some trace of their existence. I just had to find it.</p>
	<p class="block29">With not a lot of food left, and needing to think about what to do next, I found a stick to whittle into a makeshift spear. If there were any rodents, birds, or small animals nearby, I would need something to kill them with. Unfortunately, I knew far too many ways to make rat meat taste good, even out in the middle of nowhere with little to nothing to cover the rancid taste. The one and only good thing about rats is that they’re everywhere. They survive anything. Even when all other life forms shrivel up and die, like back in Hazelton, rats always find a way to live.</p>
	<p class="block29">I kept trekking, not wanting to stop or slow for any reason. Food would come, I had faith and knew sitting around waiting for it would do no good. I pulled an odd, contorted berry from a nearby bush to keep from getting too hungry. The sun, hot and scorching, pounded down as I continued on. A midday rest would be in order soon, before I passed out from the intense heat. Luckily for me, a creek trickled not too far from where I stood.</p>
	<p class="block29">Kneeling, I cupped my hands, and dipped them into the somewhat muddy water. Most people would consider drinking dirty water to be desperate times, but for me, it was a daily reality. No food, unclean water and smelly clothes were a part of everyday life. Filthy as it may have been, the water felt good on the dry walls of my throat. It was exactly what I needed to motivate me to continue moving.</p>
	<p class="block29">As I attempted to stand, my chest pulsated, knocking the breath from my lungs. Darkness flooded my vision, tunneling into a vortex. With drool strung from my lips, I fell to my knees and dropped my hands into the dirt. My stomach contracted violently as its contents spilled onto the ground in front of me, and I struggled to not follow directly behind. Pressure compressed in my ears then released, and then compressed and released, causing an intolerable whooshing sensation throughout my entire body. I was ready to die, and then the world disappeared.</p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block28"><i class="calibre6">Ah, here you come</i>. <i class="calibre6">Follow the light and bring yourself closer to me. Let go, Elodie. </i></p>
	<p class="block29">Memories flashed. The good, the bad, the old woman’s brutal murder. Everything I’d ever experienced flickered through the darkness. Alongside the visions came searing pain. I was paralyzed. Trapped within myself. Memories continued to flood my senses like a magician shuffling a deck of cards faster than I could comprehend. Then, in a jarring motion, it all stopped, revealing one final card, death.</p>
	<p class="block29">I opened my mouth in an attempt to scream.</p>
	<p class="block33">Uh-oh. Silly, Elodie. You have no voice here. </p>
	<p class="block29">Mustering every ounce of strength I had, I threw my thoughts back at the familiar voice lurking in my head.</p>
	<p class="block33">Tei…vel. Help me.</p>
	<p class="block33">I will if you let me. Let go of yourself, and come to me, child.</p>
	<p class="block29">I wanted nothing more than to listen to his voice, to Teival, the man who raised me, but something was terribly wrong. He wanted me to let go, to venture out of my body, and to join him in the spirit worlds. <i class="calibre6">The world between worlds.</i> A place I knew little about, but what I did know told me to run the other way. </p>
	<p class="block33">Never.</p>
	<p class="block33">Where will you go then, if not with me? You’re in a suspended state. Not of the world you left behind and yet, not part of the world beyond. You’ll spend the rest of time trapped in a loop, Elodie. Is that what you want? To live eternity in your own wretched spiral?</p>
	<p class="block29">A cycle formed, and once again my memories flashed. The good, the bad, the old woman’s kindness. Everything I’d ever experienced flickered through the glowing white. Alongside the visions, a sense of euphoria. I was paralyzed. Trapped within myself. Memories continued to flood my senses like a magician shuffling a deck of cards faster than my brain could comprehend. Then in a jarring motion, it all stopped, revealing one last card, the devil.</p>
	<p class="block29">I opened my mind and fully took in my surroundings.</p>
	<p class="block33">Ah, is it all making sense now, Elodie? Let go of yourself, so we can get going.</p>
	<p class="block29">If there was a way in there had to be a way out. I just had to find it. With limited strength, I knew my thoughts needed to be hidden, afraid that no matter how quiet they were, Teivel would hear them. I tucked them deep within myself, and then stepped out to face him. With every forward step I took, my strength returned to me, bit by bit.</p>
	<p class="block33">Mmmm… I have great plans for you, child. Imagine what fiery worlds we can trample together, the two of us. You, the daughter of a drunk, who once rode so proudly a top his white horse. A man who fell from victory and sold you into a life of war and famine.</p>
	<p class="block33">What worlds, Teivel? Where is Ollie? Fatima?</p>
	<p class="block29">Then, before my eyes, four horses appeared. The first, more beautiful than life itself, stood in all of its glory, white as the clouds above. The second, as rich as the seas I’d never seen, and as red as the blood of the old woman who died at the hands of Ollie. The third, so pale it was translucent, stirred the dirt of the Netherlands with its hoof. Finally, the fourth horse, black as midnight, towered over me with eyes of coal and a mane of billowing smoke.</p>
	<p class="block33">Your father’s fall from grace was the perfect storm, and I made sure to be there to put the pieces together. From victory, pestilence needed to form, and so it did, through you. You were the key to unlocking the white horse from good… to evil. A revelation, ah?</p>
	<p class="block29">Everything suddenly made sense. Ollie said he’d joined Teivel after his father sold him for supplies to fight the war amongst the people of Hazelton.  Then Fatima, his twin, came shortly after when their father sold her, too, for food to fight the famine following the war. Finally, Death befell the people, and when my father failed to save my mother, he took to drinking. He left his victorious life behind and sold me to feed the alcoholic disease that plagued him.</p>
	<p class="block33">Take the white one, Elodie. It suits you stunningly.</p>
	<p class="block29">Teivel mounted the Pale horse, and when he did, Ollie and Fatima popped into view.</p>
	<p class="block33">We’ve been waiting for you, Elodie. Glad to see you’ve decided to join us after all. Sorry about your friend. What was her name? The white witch?</p>
	<p class="block29">I forced the emotion boiling inside of me back down and managed to keep a perfectly straight face, as I conversed with him in my head.</p>
	<p class="block33">Who cares? All that matters is that I saw the errors of my ways. I should have joined you, and instead, I betrayed you. Will you ever be able to forgive me, dear brother?</p>
	<p class="block29">Ollie raised his hand in the air and then swiftly dropped it. The Red horse knelt, and he climbed onto its rippling, muscular back. Then Fatima did the same to the Black horse. Her face looked shattered, no longer a picture of innocence. Her lips were cracked, caked in dry blood, and her teeth were rotted. The skin sloughed from her arms, and patches of bone stuck from various spots on her body. She was deteriorating.</p>
	<p class="block29"><i class="calibre6">Come on, Elodie, ride with us. </i>Ollie’s voice whispered in my head.</p>
	<p class="block29">Without thinking, I charged straight for Ollie. In six enormous steps, I arrived at the side of his ruthless-looking red steed. My fingers wrapped tightly around Ollie’s foot, and I yanked with all my might. Ollie crashed down in front of me.  His face bounced off the ground, clanking his teeth together as he skidded to a stop. The crimson horse reared up, and then smashed its hooves down right beside my head, making me wince.   It came dangerously close to smashing my skull open.</p>
	<p class="block29">In an adrenaline charged rage, I jumped on top of Ollie’s fallen body, wildly swinging my arms, punching anywhere my fists would connect. A flash smeared across my vision. Next thing I knew, Fatima squatted in front of me, staring me down, but her actions didn’t intimidate me. Instead, I sprang off Ollie, tackling Fatima to the ground by wrapping my arms around her in one fluid motion.  She fell backwards like a sack of rocks.</p>
	<p class="block29">Anger swelled inside of me, and what little bit of control I had left was gone. I could no longer control myself. Pent up fury spilled out of me, as my whole life, from living in the streets of Hazelton, to watching the old woman’s brutal murder, all came flying out at the same time. Not unlike an enraged, feral animal, froth spewed from the sides of my mouth. My feet kicked out, my fists connected with flesh, and I sank my teeth into Fatima’s rotting arm. But nothing hurt the twins. They never even flinched. </p>
	<p class="block29">Red painted my vision, and abruptly, my memories flashed. The good, the bad, the old woman’s lifeless eyes. Everything I’d ever experienced flickered through the blackness. Alongside the visions, agonizing pain. I was no longer paralyzed. No longer trapped within myself. Memories flooded my senses like a magician shuffling a deck of cards faster than I could comprehend. Then, in one jarring motion, it all stopped, revealing the white witch.</p>
	<p class="block29">Precisely then, the dirt beneath my feet grumbled, and a giant crack burst from the ground. I jumped back just in time to avoid falling into the void.  Landing with a thud, there was a gnawing pain in my stomach and lungs where the wind was knocked out. With two blood streaked, dirty hands, I rubbed the debris from my eyes and saw Teivel’s horse buck him into the colossal fracture. The screeching in my head dropped me to my knees.  It was similar to the sounds of a dying hog and must have belonged to Teivel because the noise quieted at the same rate he fell.</p>
	<p class="block29">The white witch didn’t look any different than the first time we met. She was luminous, and I could feel her power pulsing through my body. Ollie and Fatima hung, suspended in mid-air beside her.  Their small, rotting bodies frozen in time.</p>
	<p class="block29"><i class="calibre6">Child.</i> I recognized the voice in my head. <i class="calibre6">We were as one after you stayed with me on the eve of my death. My power became your power, and I owed you a debt. That is why I waited in limbo for you, here, in these wastelands. My time with you, however, is limited, as I am tethered to Teivel and must follow him to the depths of Hell.</i></p>
	<p class="block33">Hell? What? No! Stay here with me. We’ll figure this out together.</p>
	<p class="block33"><span class="calibre3">It was a cost I was willing to pay. Since the passing of my human body, my powers are nearly unrivaled.  Walking the pits of Hell with him would bring me great pleasure.  This way, at least, I would know he’s securely locked in. Once the scales are balanced and nature is satisfied, this situation will right itself, Elodie, and I will end up where I belong. At peace, resting with my ancestors. </span></p>
	<p class="block29">The selfless strength of the old woman broke my heart.</p>
	<p class="block33">Now, child, you must choose what to do next. Ollie and Fatima are slated to join Teivel… but with the sacrifice of a good and willing heart,I can restore them to their previous state, before Teivel nurtured the evil in them. </p>
	<p class="block29"><i class="calibre6">I’ll sacrifice myself</i>, I thought loudly </p>
	<p class="block29"><i class="calibre6">Not so fast.</i> The old woman answered. <i class="calibre6"><span class="calibre3">In sacrificing yourself, that doesn’t mean you get to pass on.  It’s quite the opposite. You will be stuck in this world between worlds, child. There is no guarantee you will ever get out. What good you have remaining will have to be used to bring the twins back, and you will be left here to rebuild yourself.  The scales may never tip in your favor. </span></i></p>
	<p class="block29"><i class="calibre6">Restore them.</i><span class="calibre3"> I knew what had to be done. My path in the real world ended here.  The twins deserved a second chance, and if the only way to do that was by sacrificing my own life, I would do it.  No question.</span></p>
	<p class="block29">The white witch nodded and lowered Ollie and Fatima back down to the ground, an unspoken understanding between us. First, she breathed into Fatima’s mouth.  Her rotted face regenerated to its porcelain color.  Where chunks of bone had previously stuck out, the skin healed before my eyes.  Fatima’s lips filled back out, and her glazed eyes returned to vibrant. Next, the old woman knelt over Ollie while she breathed into his mouth, too. His contorted face twisted back into a natural state, his skin returned to a normal color, and the deep pink scars scattered over his body disappeared.  Before either of them woke, the witch chanted some inaudible thing, and they vanished.</p>
	<p class="block33">They will return to their bodies and wake confused with no memories of the horrid things they did while under the control of Teivel. You, on the other hand, will never forget, sweet child.</p>
	<p class="block29">I nodded, wanting so badly to hug the old woman who’d just saved my brother and sister and who’d sent the man responsible for all of this down to Hell. It wasn’t possible, though, because the old woman was a mere image of herself; a see-through version only for familiarity’s sake. And I felt my humanity slowly slipping from my grasp.</p>
	<p class="block29"><i class="calibre6"><span class="calibre3">You’re headed down a hard road, Elodie.  One filled with trying times, and a lot of navigating.  I wish you well, and hope I won’t have to return one day to collect your rotted soul.  </span></i>With that, she disappeared, leaving me and the four horses standing by ourselves in the wake of the destruction. The reality of my decision began to sink in.</p>
	<p class="block29">The thing about the Netherworld, as I would come to learn, was that the landscape reflected your projected feelings. When the old woman left, I felt alone, desolate, and out of sorts, and in turn,  the lands were barren, dark, and full of hopelessness.  The opposite of being locked in the cell of a prison, you were left to roam the vastness of your mind as far as your eye could see, with no one to guide you.</p>
	<p class="block29">Lightening cracked in the distance, momentarily lighting the skies. I wanted to cry, to show some kind of emotion, but nothing surfaced. My soul was blackened, compromised, as the white witch had once told me. The thunder in the distance roared, echoing through the vacant lands, stirring the horses. I’d never felt so hollow. Looking to the midnight sky, into the abyss, I found myself wondering what to do next.</p>
	<p class="block29">Not dead, nor alive, my ghostly existence didn’t need nutrition like my human one, so I didn’t need to eat. There were no books to read, no people to interact with, and nothing to do but wander. I now understood what had happened to Hazleton. Why it shriveled up the way it had. Teivel wanted us to ride as the four horsemen together, as a family, to be the bearers of the apocalypse. He originated from the Netherworlds, from Hell to be specific, and when his emotion got the better of him, it reflected in the landscape around him, just as it now was for me.</p>
	<p class="block29">Lightening glimmered across the horizons, and roaring thunder again followed. It felt like an earthquake. The horses stirred. I reached for the white one, but it spooked, skittering away from me. I turned to the red one, holding my hand in the air the same way Ollie had, and then dropped it. The stallion didn’t respond.  I hurled my thoughts at the black horse, to see if that would get me any further ahead.</p>
	<p class="block29">It was similar to screaming while totally alone, in silence. To say I was frustrated would be an understatement. It seemed anger and bitterness were my only range in emotion. Lightening cracked directly above me this time, and the thunder that followed was so loud it sounded like giant footsteps running toward me. I covered my ears and dropped to the ground in shock. The horses took off galloping into the distance, and I spun on my foot.  A humongous hoof, covered in flowing white hair, came into focus.</p>
	<p class="block29">Before me stood a monstrous, coal-colored Clydesdale with a mane of snow.  A loud cracking noise filled the air, and from its back stretched massive, black wings.  Steam snorted from its nostrils, and its hoof clawed the ground.  The magnificent beast stared down at me, and then closed its wings and knelt, allowing me to climb on.</p>
	<p class="block29"><span class="calibre3">As soon as she stood, our purpose was clear. Together we would wander the Netherworld as one; forever seeking, never stopping. We found our way into the other realms, and we would ride, and conquer as the lone horseman of the apocalypse, Vengeance.   </span></p>
