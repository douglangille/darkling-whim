	<p class="block20">Kelleigh Elizabeth Perry</p>
	<p class="block24"> </p>
	<p class="block24"> </p>
	<p class="block29"><span class="calibre3">FIFTEEN YEARS AGO, just after Allie was born, her parent’s bought a large Victorian house in the little town of Elmhurst. They all loved the eccentric touches the previous owners had designed into the structure of the home. Secret passageways, originally meant for pets to run through, were the perfect size for Allie to crawl around in as a child.  A special room hidden behind a stately old armoire provided her hours of entertainment. Her own room, nicknamed Narnia after her mother’s favorite childhood book, could only be described as a young girl’s dream. </span></p>
	<p class="block29">The bed was tucked between two floor-to-ceiling bookshelves filled with beautiful leather bound classics. Gauzy fabric draped over thick wooden beams and strewn with tiny twinkling lights added to the magical feel of the room. Soft light provided by strategically placed lamps and a luminescent wall behind the bed bathed the room in an ethereal glow. Large windows and intricately carved French doors across the room led out to a balcony with morning glories creeping around the twisted iron bars.</p>
	<p class="block29">The rest of the house had been decorated with expensive one-of-a-kind pieces her mother, Aileen, purchased when she travelled. Allie’s father, Dr. Spencer Montgomery, was a surgeon at the General Hospital. With her father working most of the time, and her mother bitten by the travel bug, Allie spent much of her time alone in the house. She didn’t usually mind. Her imagination would run rampant, and keeping herself entertained had never been a problem, but she was lonely. Allie longed for companionship.</p>
	<p class="block29"><span class="calibre3">When she wasn’t in school, Allie stayed in the house. Her parents were kind but very strict, and this was one of their rules. Though well-liked by her teachers, most of the kids felt her to be too stand-offish, and not being able to socialize outside of school made maintaining friendships difficult. In the summer she’d swim in the family’s pool, or lie in the sun writing pages upon pages of poems and short stories. When the weather got cold, she’d sit by the large fireplace in her bedroom, as the flames danced over freshly cut wood, and pour through her ever growing collection of books.  </span></p>
	<p class="block29">One unseasonably warm day in March Allie arrived home from school early after having suffered stomach pains while in her last period class. To her surprise, her father’s car sat in the driveway. Excited to have some company for a change, she rushed up the front steps and barreled through the front door only to come to an abrupt stop. Dr. Montgomery stood in the entranceway with a young boy, his large palm planted on the young man’s shoulder. Allie recognized him from school.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Allison, this is Brent Donaldson from down the street. He was just dropping off something for your mother.” Dr. Montgomery smiled. Allie reached out and timidly shook his hand.</p>
	<p class="block29">“I think we might have a few classes together. Anyway, I have to get going. My mom gets nervous when I don’t stop at home right after school.” Brent nervously rubbed his hand over his dark hair. “See you tomorrow, Allie. Bye, Dr. Montgomery.” Brent rushed to the door and took off jogging down the street.</p>
	<p class="block29">“What a nice young man, don’t you think, Allison?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Yeah, he’s a really nice guy, very popular at school.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Well I have to hurry back to the hospital. I’ve got three surgeries this afternoon, so if you see your mother, tell her I won’t be home until very late.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Okay, I’ll let her know.” Allie put her bag on the table near the door and began searching for her history book. Her father’s hand, like a vice, suddenly gripped her arm.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Don’t forget.” He looked sternly into her eyes. “She has to know I won’t be home for dinner, do you understand?” Allie nodded as he loosened his grip and his eyes softened. “Alright, I’ll see you at breakfast tomorrow.” He kissed the top of her head and walked out the front door, whistling as he made his way to his car.</p>
	<p class="block29">Still stunned and confused by his tone, Allie gathered her books and rushed up to her room. She sat for a few moments going over the strange events that had just taken place before losing herself in a chapter on The Great Depression. With history done, she quickly completed her math assignment before starting her chemistry lab report. By now, her eyelids were heavy. She tried to fight it but soon succumbed to sleep amidst the notebook and textbook strewn bed.</p>
	<p class="block29">A knocking in the wall woke Allie with a start. Every now and then the pipes banged and the sound resonated throughout the old house. As a small child, she played a game where she tried to match the noises by knocking on the wall. Most of the time it was short lived and she got bored, but one day in particular, she remembered the noises sounding as though they were answering her. For over an hour she knocked on the wall and heard a clanking response. She told her parents about it at breakfast the next morning. They exchanged a glance and her mother told her it was just a coincidence, and she should stop playing silly games. Her time would be better spent improving her reading and writing skills.</p>
	<p class="block29">Until now, Allie hadn’t thought twice about the noises in the wall, but this time they seemed somehow different; the pattern almost frantic. She reached her hand out to touch the wall, catching a glimpse of her wristwatch as she did. In a panic, Allie rushed down the stairs to find her mother in the living room going over a list of items she needed to pack for her next trip. This time she was going to The Netherlands. Allie had never been invited along on these journeys.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Mother,” she blurted out, causing Aileen to startle, “I meant to tell you father won’t be home for dinner.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“I’d have figured as much by now, my dear, had he not called earlier and told me himself. It’s nine-thirty, and dinner is usually at seven. I tried to wake you, but you were sound asleep, so I’ve left a platter for you in the refrigerator.” Her mother smiled.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Please, don’t tell him I forgot to let you know he’d be late.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“I won’t, now off with you. I need to finish my list before bed.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Alright, thank you, Mother.” Allie slipped out of the living room and took her plate from the refrigerator. After only a few bites of chicken, she threw the rest of the cold, dry meat and potatoes away. Rinsing her plate in the sink and opening the dishwasher, Allie was surprised to see two plates already in the otherwise empty machine.  Why would there be two already if just she and her mother were home? Maybe her mother had eaten at seven and gotten hungry again before Allie had come down. Allie shrugged it off, grabbed an apple from the bowl on the marble island, and headed back up to her room to finish her homework.</p>

	<p class="block24"> </p>
	<p class="block28">Months passed and school let out for the summer. Allie spent most of her days poolside, reading a new set of books her mother bought for her on her most recent trip. When it rained, she sat in her room filling notebooks with stories and poetry, or journaling about her dreams and aspirations. As the school year began, Allie was excited to get away from the house for even a few hours a day. She’d started to feel as though it were a prison. </p>
	<p class="block29">One day, early in September, Allie bumped into Brent Donaldson in the hallway. Color crept up her neck and into her cheeks. Some of her writings over the summer had included Brent, and she found herself thinking about him more and more each day. She stood, frozen, unable to speak, as he smiled at her and said hello.</p>
	<p class="block29">“How have you been, Allie? I didn’t see you this summer. Were you away?” Brent appeared genuinely interested, making Allie even more nervous.</p>
	<p class="block29">“N-n-no,” she stammered, “I was home. I usually just stay in and around the house.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Oh, well did anything interesting happen?” He looked nervous and a little frightened when he asked.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Well, I got some new books, and I did a lot of writing.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“That’s all, huh?” Allie watched as relief washed over his face. “I’m glad to hear it.” Brent flashed a beautiful white smile and ran his hand through his hair.</p>
	<p class="block29">“How was your summer?” she asked.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Great, my family spent a month at the beach, and a group of us rented a cabin in the mountains for a week. If I’d known you were home, I would have invited you along.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Allie blushed. “My parents wouldn’t have let me go. They’re really strict about how I spend my time.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Right, I forgot. Anyway, I’ll see you around, Abby.” He slung his backpack over his shoulder and took off down the hall.</p>
	<p class="block29">Allie stood staring after him, confused. Had Brent Donaldson just called her Abby? No, he knew her name; they’d been in school together since the third grade. It must have been her imagination. The ringing of the bell startled her back to reality, and she raced down the hallway to her first class.</p>
	<p class="block29">In early October the entire junior class was assigned a project. They were to work with a partner to write a research paper on a controversial scientific topic. Allie hated these kinds of projects. She was always chosen last and ended up working with the only other unfortunate soul who no one wanted to work with. This time, however, they were to be assigned partners. The list had been posted outside the science room door, and everyone crowded around to see who they were paired up with. Guys were high fiving each other, girls either giggled or groaned, and then there was Brent. He stood next to the list smiling broadly as Allie approached.</p>
	<p class="block29">“It looks like we’ll be working together on this one.” He pointed at their names halfway down the page. “I already have some ideas about which topic we should choose. Let’s meet at lunch and talk.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Okay,” she replied, timidly, “where do you want to meet?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“I usually eat by the old oak tree on the edge of campus. It’s between the gym and the football field. Bring your lunch, and we can try to pin down a topic and a focus.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Allie knew exactly where Brent ate lunch. She’d made it a point to avoid him by eating in the cafeteria. Now he was asking her to have lunch alone with him. She couldn’t decide if this would be a dream come true or her worst nightmare. Both terrified and exhilarated, she agreed, and they parted ways heading to their next class.</p>
	<p class="block29">As each minute ticked by, Allie became more and more nervous. Word had spread that Brent asked her to have lunch with him, and many of the other girls were jealous. She overheard one group talking about it as she made her way to her locker.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Can you believe Brent Donaldson asked Allison Montgomery to have lunch with him?” </p>
	<p class="block29">“As if they would ever work out as a couple...”</p>
	<p class="block29">“He doesn’t even know her name. He kept calling her Abby.” </p>
	<p class="block29">They all started giggling before walking away. Allie hid her face in her locker as tears streamed down her face. She had never done anything to these girls, yet they taunted her and talked behind her back. Even worse, they confirmed her earlier suspicion; Brent had indeed called her Abby. She was so embarrassed to have thought he might be interested in her. How could he be if he couldn’t even remember her name?</p>
	<p class="block29">She considered standing him up for their lunch together, but since it involved a school project, she swallowed her pride and walked out to the oak tree. Brent was already there waiting. He waved her over.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Hey, Allie, come sit down.” He patted the ground next to him. “I have an idea for our topic I think you’ll really like.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Okay, what are you thinking?” She asked as she settled on the soft grass.</p>
	<p class="block29">“How about Nature versus Nurture, and we could use your dad as a reference?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“My dad? Why would we ask him? He’s a surgeon.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Brent stared back at Allie, fear and shock flashing in his eyes. “Oh, that’s right, he’s a surgeon. For some reason I thought he was in research. Forget I said anything, we can choose another topic.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“No, I like the topic. We’ll just have to find a different source to reference.” She smiled at him. “Are you okay?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Yeah, I’m fine, Abby. No worries.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Did you just call me Abby?”</p>
	<p class="block29">Brent’s eyes were as big as saucers. “Did I? I’m sorry.” He squirmed awkwardly.</p>
	<p class="block29">“It’s fine. You’ve said it before though, is there a reason?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“No, it was just a slip. Listen, I have to go. I’ll call you and we can make plans to meet and write the paper. What’s your number?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Oh, okay,” she said, disappointed. After giving her number, he quickly gathered his things and took off toward the gym.</p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block28">Later that night, Allie sat in her bed surrounded by books on twins and the ‘Nature vs. Nurture’ phenomenon. There were so many fascinating stories of siblings separated at birth, brought up in different households, and in different living situations. Some ended up complete opposites, while others ended up with similar personalities, likes and dislikes. Without noticing the passage of time, Allie found herself awake past midnight pouring over her research and taking notes, when the pipes suddenly started banging in the walls. It had been months since she last heard them clanking away, and it startled her causing her to jump and scatter the books and paper everywhere.</p>
	<p class="block29">She placed her hand against the wall to feel the vibrations. Thinking back to her childhood, she knocked the same rhythm on the wall. The banging stopped, and for a few moments, it was silent.  Allie pushed her ear up against the wall. At first, she heard nothing more than the slight buzzing of the electrical wires, but moments later she heard something more. The muffled voices of two individuals having a conversation reverberated through the drywall. Pulling her head away, she thought it must be her parents talking somewhere downstairs, but when she listened again, it became clear that both voices were female.</p>
	<p class="block29">Her mother left for London the day before, so Allie wasn’t sure who it was she could be hearing. Quietly slipping out of her bed, she tip-toed out into the hallway and down the staircase to investigate. With her robe wrapped tight around her body and her slippers gliding across the marble tiles of the hallway, she moved unnoticed toward the room directly beneath her bedroom, her father’s study. The door hung slightly ajar, so she pushed gently to get a better view. To her surprise, Allie found her father at his desk, furiously typing away on his laptop. He looked up when he heard the door squeak.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Allison, what are you doing awake at this hour? It’s nearly one o’clock.” </p>
	<p class="block29">“I’m sorry, Father. I was studying and thought I heard someone talking down here. I must have been mistaken.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Her father looked at her with a furrowed brow. “What do you think you heard?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Just two people talking with one another. I thought they were female, but now I see that couldn’t have been the case. I hope I didn’t disturb you. I’m going to back to bed. Goodnight.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Before you go, can you tell me where you heard these ‘voices’?”</p>
	<p class="block29">Allie hesitated for a moment. “Well…I heard the pipes knocking next to my bed. I put my ear to the wall and thought I heard a conversation, but I couldn’t make it out, only soft mumbling.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“What have your mother and I told you about those pipes, Allison? I thought you had outgrown this silly obsession with them. It’s just the hot water running through cold metal, nothing more. Now off with you, and I don’t want to hear any more about those pipes, understand?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Yes, Father.” Allie turned and pulled the door closed behind her. She knew what she heard. There were definitely people talking somewhere nearby, but where? The house sat on a five acre lot with no neighbors on either side within screaming distance, never mind just talking. She heard a telephone ringing as she got back to her room. It must have been her mother calling to check in on her and her father. After lying in bed for what seemed like hours thinking about the strange voices, Allie finally fell into a fitful sleep.</p>
	<p class="block29">She woke to the sound of rain against her window late in the morning. Saturdays were not usually meant for sleeping in at the Montgomery home. Her father always made sure she woke at eight to have breakfast with him in the large dining room. Her mother would also join when she was home every few weeks. Glancing at the clock next to her bed, Allie noted the time, ten-thirty, and quickly got herself up. After a quick shower, she dressed and went down to find out why her father had not woken her—only to find a note on the corkboard in the kitchen.</p>
	<p class="block33">‘Allison, I just got called into work for an emergency surgery. I’ll be home late tonight.’</p>
	<p class="block29">How strange. Her father had never been called in to work for any type of emergency. Now she would have to spend the day alone, cooped up in the house. It was probably for the best, though, as her father had the only computer with internet access in the house. Perhaps she could go online and do more research for her project. She made herself some eggs and toast, ate quickly in the kitchen, and went into the study to start working. Dr. Montgomery had very strict rules about her internet use, but since this would be research for a school project, Allie figured he wouldn’t mind. She settled herself in his large office chair and carefully moved his paperwork out of the way.</p>
	<p class="block29">As she pushed some of his files aside, one in particular caught her eye. A large stamp said ‘CONFIDENTIAL’ on the front, and unlike his other files, this one was very thick. She knew better than to open it, but she did look at the tab for a name. Understandably, there were no real identifiers, only the letters ‘NvN’ handwritten in the space. Setting it aside, she turned the computer on and got to work. After two hours had gone by, Allie had a large stack of printouts and she turned the screen off and headed out to the kitchen for a snack. </p>
	<p class="block29">Taking a yogurt from the fridge, she walked into the living room and settled down on the overstuffed couch, pen in hand, ready to take notes on her research. Before she even had a chance to take a bite of her yogurt, Allie was interrupted by the ringing of the doorbell. She rushed over and looked through the peephole, wondering who could possibly be stopping by today. When she saw who it was, her heart started pounding and her knees nearly buckled under her.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Hi, Brent,” she said as she opened the door, “I wasn’t expecting to see you today.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Hey, Allie, can I come in and talk to you for a minute?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Sure? Is it about the project?” She moved aside ushering Brent into the foyer. He peeled his soaking wet jacket and hat off, and Allie took them and hung them in the closet.</p>
	<p class="block29">“No, I didn’t come to talk about the project. I wanted to apologize for running off on you yesterday at lunch. I know it seemed really awkward, and I wanted to explain.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Why don’t you come into the living room and sit down. I’ll start a fire and you can dry off while we talk.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Thanks, but let me start it.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Okay, can I get you anything to eat or drink?”</p>
	<p class="block29">He smiled at her causing Allie to blush. “If you’re offering, I’m starving.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“No problem, I’ll make a few sandwiches and some cocoa. Does that sound alright?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Sounds perfect, thanks, Allie.”</p>
	<p class="block29">She pointed out the firewood and matches and then headed back into the kitchen. Standing by the sink, Allie grabbed onto the counter for support as her heart rate slowed and the color left her cheeks. She took a few deep breaths to calm down before preparing lunch. Sandwiches were easy, but she worried the whole time that Brent might not like the way she made them. He could be allergic to tomatoes, or he might be lactose intolerant, and the cheese would make him sick. The sound of the kettle boiling on the stove snapped her back to reality. She mixed the cocoa and put everything on a tray and carried it all to the living room.</p>
	<p class="block29">The fire crackled in the hearth and Brent stood close, warming his hands and drying his clothes. She placed the tray on the coffee table, and he came and sat down near her on the couch. Both ate in silence. Brent polished off his sandwich and yogurt before Allie had finished half of hers. He leaned back on the couch and sipped his cocoa.</p>
	<p class="block29">“So, what did you came to talk about?” She asked him, hoping to break the awkward silence in the room.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Oh yeah, I wanted to say how sorry I am for leaving so quickly yesterday. I know it probably seemed like I blew you off, and that wasn’t the case at all. The truth is, I like you Allie, and I got embarrassed when I called you Abby and brought up your father’s research. I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable.” He stared at her, waiting for a response.</p>
	<p class="block29">Allie never dreamed Brent Donaldson had feelings for her. She didn’t even realize he knew she existed until that day in March when he’d been dropping something off to her father. “You like me? Seriously?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Well, yeah. You’re really pretty, and you don’t worry about what everyone else thinks about you like those other shallow girls at school. Plus, you’re really smart, and I like that I can talk to you about school stuff and know we’re on the same level.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Allie was speechless. No boy had ever liked her before, and she wasn’t sure how to react, so she just sat there, staring at Brent. After a few moments, she processed what he had said to her. “What did you mean when you said my father’s research?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“The ‘Nature vs. Nurture’ project he’s been working on. He has a lot of stuff on the subject, so I thought we might be able to use some of it to our benefit. Of course I know we can’t actually ask him about it, but maybe we can look around and see what he has on the subject. It would give us a big advantage.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“I think you’re mistaken. My father is a surgeon, and he’s almost always at the hospital. He doesn’t have time to do any additional research. Besides, I’m sure he would have told me about it if he was. He tells me about his work all the time.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“You said that yesterday, but he’s not a…” Brent got cut off by the sound of the front door opening. Dr. Montgomery walked in carrying an armful of mail and his briefcase which he dropped when he saw Allie and Brent.</p>
	<p class="block29">“What are you doing here?” he boomed. His face twisted with anger as he stared directly at Brent. “I told you not to come bother my daughter again.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Father, Brent and I are working on a school project and…”</p>
	<p class="block29">“I wasn’t speaking to you, Allison,” he cut her off. “Go to your room.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“But we…”</p>
	<p class="block29">“I said, go to your room. Brent and I need to have a little talk.” Embarrassed and confused, Allie ran out of the room and up the stairs. She wanted to hear the conversation but knew he’d know if she didn’t go into her room. Closing the door, she flopped down on her bed as tears rolled down her cheeks. A boy finally said he liked her, and her father could ruin it all. She cried until she heard her father’s footsteps coming up the stairs. Wiping her tears, she sat up on the bed and waited.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Allison, may I come in please?” Her father didn’t wait for an answer. He came into the room and stood over Allie. “Whatever that boy said to you is a lie, do you understand me? I don’t ever want to find him in this house again. What were you thinking allowing him in with neither your mother nor myself home?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“He stopped by to talk, and we are partnered up for a project at school. I thought we might be able to work on it a little.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Well, I’ll be in touch with the school tomorrow to get that changed. You are not to be around him anymore.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“But, Father, he likes me, and I like him. I hoped to have your permission to maybe go out with him sometime.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Absolutely not, and this subject is closed. I don’t even want to hear his name uttered in my presence. Is that clear?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“It is, but our topic is ‘Nature vs. Nurture’ and he thought you might be able to help us out on our paper.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“He said what? Never mind, I’ve heard enough. Here,” her father shoved her printouts into her hands, “and don’t let me catch you in my study when I am not home again, young lady.” He stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind him. </p>
	<p class="block29">Allie spent the rest of the evening feeling sorry for herself and for Brent. She knew her father could be very frightening. Deciding it would be best to wait until the next day to call him, she slowly fell into a fitful and worried sleep.</p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block"> </p>
	<p class="block28">As the sun’s rays stretched across the floor and slowly crept up to Allie’s bed, she began her daily routine. First a shower, followed by breakfast with her father in the dining room, and then back to her room to enjoy some alone time writing. It was unseasonably warm that day, so she grabbed her book bag and gathered all of her papers together. The pool in the back yard had been covered since Labor Day Weekend, but the lounge chairs were still out, so she settled herself down in one and got to arranging her work. Their paper wasn’t due for nearly two weeks, but Allie liked to have everything done ahead of time. She didn’t work well under pressure.</p>
	<p class="block29">Remembering she had planned to call Brent, she flipped open her phone to find a strange text message he must have sent her the night before.</p>
	<p class="block29">‘You have to save Abby. Check the gate at the back of the property. Your father is lying to you about everything!’</p>
	<p class="block29">What did he mean? Who is this Abby he kept bringing up? She thought it would be best to call him and find out what he’d meant. After dialing, Allie waited to hear Brent’s voice answer, but instead she heard an unfamiliar voice.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Brent Donaldson’s phone, can I help you?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Oh, um, I hope so, this is Allie Montgomery. Brent and I are doing a school project together, and I wanted to talk to him about it if I could.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Brent was hit by a car last evening. He’s in a coma. I’m one of the doctor’s taking care of him and thought you might be a family member calling. Do you know how I can get in touch with them? We haven’t been able to reach them by phone, and he only had his school I.D. card on him at the time. It’s Saturday so we haven’t been able to get I touch with the school to get his address, and no one has filed a missing person’s report on him yet.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“He’s where? What happened? When did they find him? Who hit him?” Allie asked, flustered. How had father not heard about this and told her this morning?</p>
	<p class="block29">“A hit and run, and that’s all I can say, sweetie. I’m sorry, but I can only give out medical information to family.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Allie hung up after giving the doctor Brent’s address, staring at the text he’d sent her. What gate at the back of the property? The only one she could think of led to a small side garden where her father kept his tools and an old car. Brent must have been mistaken. And who is this Abby she kept hearing about?</p>
	<p class="block29">“Allison,” her father strode over to her. “I just got word that your ‘friend’ has been in an accident. I’m going to the hospital to see if there is anything I can do.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Father, can I please come? I need to see that he’s okay. It’s my fault he was out at that time, after all. If I hadn’t offered him something to eat and drink, maybe he would have left sooner.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“No! I told you last night you aren’t to see him anymore and I meant it, I’ll be back later.” With that, he headed back into the house, and a few moments later, Allie heard his car fired up in the driveway and take off down the street.</p>
	<p class="block29">Furious, Allie jumped up and rushed into the house. She slipped into her father’s study and turned on the computer, determined to find out something more about the accident. As the bulky machine went through its loading process, she scanned his desk. Her eyes came to a rest on the thick folder labeled ‘NvN’. She picked it up, listened carefully to ensure she was alone in the house, and flipped the cardstock open. Inside were two smaller files, one labeled AM1 and the other AM2. Brimming with curiosity, Allie flipped open the first file.</p>
	<p class="block29">Her infant eyes stared up from the glossy finish of a classic photograph. Mother posed next to her looking beautiful in a gliding rocker. A copy of her birth certificate, listing her full name, Allison Katherine Montgomery, along with her parents’ names, clung to the front of the folder, attached with a paperclip. The second folder made her breath catch in her throat. </p>
	<p class="block29">Allie had always been told she was the only child her mother had ever been able to conceive. Ignoring the rest of the files contents, she pushed it aside and opened the next one, slowly, afraid of what she might find. Inside, a similar picture of a baby and her mother looking down. The baby’s face appeared identical to Allie’s own infantile features. Her mother sat in an old spindle rocker, her robe tattered and worn, and the baby in little more than a cloth diaper. </p>
	<p class="block29">There must have been a mistake. Allie didn’t have any siblings, but when she saw the birth certificate in this file, it couldn’t be denied. Her parents had lied to her. On the line for ‘Child’s Name’ it said Abigail Noreen Montgomery. Both were marked with the same familiar birthday, July 16, 1998. </p>
	<p class="block29">Tears brimmed in her eyes as horrible thoughts ran through her head about what must have happened to Abigail and why she had never heard about her. None of these thoughts, however, were anywhere near as horrifying as the truth which soon would be revealed. Her body, wracked with terror and sadness, shook as she tried to put the files back together. She placed them back in the main folder and rushed out of the room up the stairs to her bedroom. She spent the rest of the afternoon alternately crying and wondering what could have possibly happened to her sister, and how she had lived fifteen years without ever knowing about her.</p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block"> </p>
	<p class="block28">As night fell, Allie still hadn’t heard from her father, and her mother had yet to make her nightly call to check in on the two of them. She made a quick trip to the kitchen and heated up the leftover spaghetti from the previous night before heading back up to her room. Her head spun after the discovery in her father’s study. Perhaps this is why her mother travelled so much and her father worked so frequently. They must blame her, in a way, for being the one to have lived and thrived. Their guilt over losing Abigail must have been why Allie lived such a pampered yet sheltered life. It all started to make sense, but one question remained unanswered. Why hadn’t they told her about her sister?</p>
	<p class="block29">In her silent bedroom, Allie tried to piece together the events of the last few days. The voices in the wall, Brent’s strange behavior at school, the mention of her father’s research she had known nothing about, the text message, the files in her father’s study. It all had to mean something. Suddenly, it clicked. She jumped off her bed, ran down the stairs and out to the back of the house. The old wooden door in the fence looked overgrown with ivy and weeds, but as she got closer she realized the vegetation wasn’t real. It had been glued onto the gate to give the appearance of an unused passageway. She tore off the plastic flora and unlatched the door.</p>
	<p class="block29">The opposite side of the fence didn’t look at all as she remembered it. No old car, no tools scattered around, in fact, a dirt pathway leading to what looked like a solid wall stood in its place. She had a feeling the wall wasn’t what it appeared, and started searching around for some clue as to what it might be hiding. Feeling along the bottom with her hands, Allie hit upon a lever which caused the wall to open inward.  A small set of stairs led down to a dirty, concrete foundation floor. She hesitated. Without some source of light, she couldn’t see more than five feet in. Frightened of what she might find if she ventured any farther, Allie turned around and fled back into the yard.</p>
	<p class="block29"><span class="calibre3">The last vestiges of light disappeared behind the hills as dusk fell. She tried to put the fake foliage back on the gate as best she could before heading back into the house.  Slipping in through the kitchen, she searched around through the drawers trying to find a flashlight. Interrupted by her father’s voice emanating from the study, Allie froze. </span></p>
	<p class="block29"><span class="calibre3">“What do you mean he’s awake? He wasn’t supposed to live through the crash. I hit him hard enough to break every bone in his body. Is he talking?” Her father paused as the person on the other end of the line answered. “Never mind, I’ll come and take care of it myself.  If he tells anyone about the girls nearly sixteen years’ worth of research could be ruined. I just need to go tell Allison I’m heading back for another surgery </span>and then I’m on my way. Don’t let anyone in to see him before then, do you understand? Good,” he huffed as he slammed down the phone cursing.</p>
	<p class="block29">Allie couldn’t believe what she’d just heard, and there wasn’t any way for her to get past the study without being seen. Thinking quickly, she hurried around the kitchen island and opened and slammed the door, feigning just having come in from the yard. Dr. Montgomery, having heard the door, headed into the kitchen.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Is everything okay, Father? You look flushed.” Allie tested the waters to ensure he didn’t know she had overheard his conversation.</p>
	<p class="block29">“No, Allison. It’s not. I’m afraid your friend Brent took a turn for the worse and is not expected to live through the night. I’m going back to the hospital to see if there is anything else we can do for him.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Please let me come” she pleaded, “I need to say goodbye.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“We’ve already discussed this, and, besides, I don’t want you exposed to this kind of tragedy. He’s gone and his broken body is merely a shell at this point. I’m sorry, but I have to go.” He turned his back as tears fell from her eyes and her blood boiled with rage.</p>
	<p class="block29">“You’re lying to me. I heard you on the phone. You’re the one who hit him, and you did it on purpose. You were trying to kill him.” Nearly hysterical, Allie ran at her father and lashed out, hitting and kicking him as hard as she could. He quickly subdued her.</p>
	<p class="block29">“What did you hear, Allison? Tell me!” he screamed as he shook her.</p>
	<p class="block29">She gulped at the air, desperate to catch her breath. “I know about Abigail. I know I had a sister. What did you do to her? Why didn’t you tell me? She’s still alive. I saw the file in your study. Father, what have you done?”</p>
	<p class="block29">Her father’s face went ghostly pale. For a moment, Allie thought he might hit her, but instead he fell to his knees sobbing. Holding his head in his hands, he tried to regain his composure. A deafening silence followed. Allie didn’t know if she should run or call the police. Her mind couldn’t make sense of it all, only adding to her fear and confusion.</p>
	<p class="block29">All at once, a blood-curdling scream pierced the air. Dr. Montgomery looked up as the sound filled the kitchen. “No! This can’t be happening. It’s too soon.” </p>
	<p class="block29">Allie didn’t wait for him to get up. She rushed to the wall and listened. Another scream and a woman’s voice trying to comfort its source filtered through the sheetrock. Her father jumped to his feet and rushed to the back door. Allie followed as he tore through the yard, yanked open the gate, and lumbered over to the secret door in the wall. He hit the latch on the ground and the door opened inward. The screaming became more intense, and Allie instinctively knew she had to find the source, even if it meant following her father into the dark hallway. </p>
	<p class="block29">He hit a switch on the wall she hadn’t seen before, and the tunnel illuminated. They were in a portion of the house Allie never knew existed, and the sounds of the two women grew louder with each step. This underground passageway had been set-up like a maze, allowing only those who knew their way through to reach the endpoint. After a series of twists and turns around blind, dark corners, the two finally came to a large metal door. Her father pulled a tarnished key ring from his pocket and fumbled to find the one matching the door in the dim, fluorescent light. </p>
	<p class="block29">Once unlocked, the metal door swung open to reveal a room identical in size and shape to Allie’s own bedroom. She looked around, slowly absorbing a horrifying contrast to the opulence of her retreat from the world. A metal-framed bed, with only a thin mattress, stood against the wall where Allie’s own bed resided in her room. A tiny desk with a few notebooks and pencils sat up against the opposite wall, and where there should have been windows, a framed area with a painting of the back yard hung. Where her flooring boasted thick, lush carpeting, this room had concrete with painted areas to look like throw rugs. A small hole in the wall revealed a dumb-waiter which must have connected in some way to the house. Its rope and pulley system seemed archaic next to the exposed brass pipes in the niche.</p>
	<p class="block29">A young girl lay half naked on the bed. Her face matched Allie’s identically, and a swollen abdomen, continuous screaming, and moans could only mean one thing; she was having a baby. Her mother, who should have been in the South of France, turned when she heard Allie and her father enter the room. Aileen held tightly to the young girl’s hand as Dr. Montgomery moved to the end of the bed.</p>
	<p class="block29">“What happened? She isn’t due for over three weeks. What have you done?” Allie had never seen her father speak to her mother in such a way.</p>
	<p class="block29">“I didn’t do anything. Her water broke an hour ago. I tried calling you, but no one answered, and when I tried again a few minutes ago, the line beeped back with a busy signal.”</p>
	<p class="block29">The girl on the bed appeared to be in so much pain she could barely speak, but her eyes met Allie’s and both girls instantly knew who the other was.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Abby?” Allie cautiously walked over to the bedside. Her sister nodded her head just as a contraction rendered her speechless, and she yelled out in agony.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Shit, here it comes. Push, Abigail,” their father said as the baby slid out. Abby cried and their mother tried to comfort her, but the baby didn’t move or make a noise. Dr. Montgomery placed it in a blanket on the floor and tried to clear it’s airway as its tiny body turned blue. He panicked and started doing CPR as the baby lay lifeless.</p>
	<p class="block29">“What happened? Why isn’t it crying? Where’s Brent? He has to know the baby’s here.” Abby’s anxiety grew with each word.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Brent? How do you know him?” Allie was shocked to hear his name.</p>
	<p class="block29">“He’s the baby’s father,” Abby said as she stared down at the baby. “Please, someone call him, now!”</p>
	<p class="block29">Finally it all made sense. The pieces of this puzzle all began falling into place when she heard a tiny cry coming from the blanket on the floor. Before her eyes, the baby pinked up and started moving.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Give me my baby,” Abby demanded, as her father picked up the blanket.</p>
	<p class="block29">“No, Abigail. The experiment has been compromised, and this baby cannot stay here. I shouldn’t have revived it, and now I have to get rid of it.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“The hell you will.” The girls’ mother jumped from her chair and snatched the baby from him. She handed it over to Allie as she pulled out a small hand gun from beneath her robe, the same one she’d been wearing in the picture Allie found in her father’s study. “I’ve let you use our daughters for your ridiculous research for far too long. Enough is enough, Spencer. It’s over, now get out.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Aileen, you’re a part of this too, and just as guilty as I am; pretending to go abroad every few weeks to spend an equal amount of time with each of the girls. If I go down, you’re coming with me.” He lunged at her, causing Aileen to drop the gun. The two hit the concrete slab hard, and everyone heard the sound as Dr. Montgomery’s head came into contact with the floor. Blood pooled all around him, his eyes grew wide, and his mouth opened in a silent scream. Allie ran to her sister’s bedside, cradling the baby in her arms as their mother picked herself up off the floor, tears rolling down her cheeks.</p>
	<p class="block29">“No! Spencer, wake up. You have to wake up!” Her pleas were unanswered. Dr. Montgomery had died. Their mother sobbed over his lifeless body, the girls watching in disbelief, as the baby’s cries echoed through the barren chamber.</p>
	<p class="block29">Allie handed the infant to Abby and watched as she carefully unfolded the blanket. “It’s a boy.” </p>
	<p class="block29">Allie looked back and forth between her sister and parents. Her father’s body remained still as her mother curled into a ball beside him. Feeling dizzy and lightheaded, the room began to close in on her. She heard Abby’s voice screaming her name before her world went black.</p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block"> </p>
	<p class="block28">Allie slowly woke the following day in a cold, white hospital room. Unable to open her eyes right away, she heard the unfamiliar voices of doctors and nurses, her mother’s occasional quiet weeping, and the blips of the monitors. She didn’t remember much of what had happened, and she called out for Abby who sat in a wheelchair across from her bed holding a beautiful baby in her arms. </p>
	<p class="block29">“What happened?” Allie croaked out.</p>
	<p class="block29">“You passed out and hit your head on the floor. We didn’t think you were going to make it through the night.” Abby reached for Allie’s hand. “I’m so happy you’re okay. Mother told me everything. Rest a while and I’ll explain later.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“I’ve been asleep for an entire day. Please, tell me now,” Allie replied, anxious to hear what her sister knew. Her head throbbed. She reached up and winced feeling a sizable lump where her skull hit the concrete. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Are you sure you’re ready for this?” Abby’s face reflected concern for her sister.</p>
	<p class="block29">“I need to know, Abby.”</p>
	<p class="block29">For the next hour, Abby told Allie everything she had learned. Their father had come up with his ‘experiment’ when their parents found out they were having twins. He had forced their mother into participating in the ‘Ultimate Nature vs. Nurture Project’, as he liked to call it. They split their time equally between the girls. Their father was actually a research assistant posing as a surgeon to account for his time spent away from Allie. The two weeks each month their mother left to go on her lavish trips were spent with Abby in what Allie now learned wasn’t just a bedroom, but an entire underground compound. It had been constructed identically to the upper level of the house, complete with three bedrooms two bathrooms, and a laundry room. Not having a matching downstairs, it lacked a kitchen, so when Allie had heard the banging of the pipes all of these years, it had actually been Abby trying to get her parent’s attention to send her down a meal on the dumb-waiter.</p>
	<p class="block29">The execution of the plan had been flawless. Both girls were fed the same food and allowed the same amount of time to sleep each day, but Abby hadn’t been given access to a proper education. She only saw the outside world at night while Allie slept, and those were just brief thirty minute outings into the yard. She’d been given drugs and alcohol as a child, addicted to heroin at age twelve, and then forced to suffer through withdrawals when her father abruptly stopped supplying it, giving her sugar pills instead. He’d brought Brent in to impregnate Abby so he could study the life of a single teenage mother with no resources. It hadn’t taken much to get him to perform the act. Dr. Montgomery had drugged his daughter and Brent enough that it took very little persuasion. Their mother hadn’t known about either of these experiments until it was too late.</p>
	<p class="block29">The plan had backfired, however, when Brent stopped taking the medication Dr. Montgomery had given him and his memories started coming back. When their father found Brent and Allie alone in the house, he’d been afraid the boy told his daughter what he’d been forced into doing, so he ran Brent down with his car hoping to to kill him. When he found out about the school project and the topic they had chosen, he knew he had to get rid of Brent once and for all.</p>
	<p class="block29">“He’s not dead though, is he? Brent didn’t die from the crash.” Allie suddenly remembered the conversation she had overheard her father having.</p>
	<p class="block29">“No, in fact he just got moved out of the ICU. They let him come up and see me and the baby this morning. He kept calling me Allie and making me giggle. They said the crash affected his memory a little, but he should have a full recovery.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“That’s what first made me suspicious! He called me Abby a few times a school. He never came out and told me about you, but he tried to point me in the right direction. He sent me a text on his way home. It must have been just before Father hit him.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“He saved my life and Brenson’s…” Abby’s words drifted off.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Is that the baby’s name?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Yeah. I wanted to combine Brent’s and yours. You both saved us and got us out of that horrible place.” Allie felt honored.</p>
	<p class="block29">“So where do we go from here?”</p>
	<p class="block29">Abby smiled. “I’m not sure,” she looked down at Brenson, “but now that we’re together, it can only get better.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Their mother walked in the room, flanked by police officers, looking nervously at the girls and the baby. She had tears in her eyes. “Allie, are you alright?” She cautiously stepped toward the bedside. The officers remained near the doorway allowing her to have a moment with her family.</p>
	<p class="block29">Allie couldn’t decide if she wanted to hug her mother or strangle her for what she’d done. She was just as guilty as their father, even if she didn’t know the full extent of what he’d done to Abby.</p>
	<p class="block29">“I’m fine, Mother,” she replied, coldly. “You can go. I don’t want to see you right now.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“I wanted to apologize to you girls for everything that happened. I didn’t know how far your father had taken his obsession. You deserved better lives, both of you, and I’m so sorry.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Allie adjusted the prongs delivering oxygen in her nose. “You’ve said your peace, now get out.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“I understand why you’re angry, Allison. We’ve all been hurt terribly. You have no idea what I went through, the abuse I had to withstand over the years, so your father could conduct his ‘experiment’. There is really only one way I can rectify it so we can all be at peace.” She looked over her shoulder and saw Brent being wheeled in the room to see Allie. In a flash, she withdrew a lighter from her pocket, and before the girls had a chance to protest, she flicked it on and held it over the nozzle on the wall labeled ‘Oxygen’. </p>
	<p class="block29">The explosion could be heard for miles, and with that, Dr. Montgomery’s project and legacy were wiped out for good.</p>
