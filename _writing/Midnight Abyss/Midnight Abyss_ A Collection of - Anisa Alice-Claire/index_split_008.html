	<p class="block28">THREE VILLAGES AWAY, just after twilight stomped out any vestige of the day, I heard the rumblings indicative of an impending battle. It was clear there was blood to be shed, and the lycanthropes were stirring the pot. My curiosity piqued when vaguely familiar voices rose above the din of the pack. Unthinkable, those of my own species, created from my blood alone, would dare risk their lives fighting with dogs on the eve of a full moon. Who were these fools, these indiscriminate night-walkers, who so carelessly toyed with the gift of eternal life which I bestowed upon them? I rushed through the darkness toward the noise of the scuffle, creeping among the shadows of the buildings, desperate to see the faces of these traitors and the mongrels.</p>
	<p class="block29">Standing with my back against the cool bricks, I slid my tongue across my fangs, delighting in the pain as they tore into the fleshy muscle. ‘The Queen’s Kiss’, it was called. Just a taste of my blood could save the most terminally injured from certain death and provide immortality. I alone am The Creator, and I alone shall be the one to destroy them. I delight in the first embrace, the feeling of their lips upon my own, and the passionate affair when they realize that their feelings and emotions are heightened. With all of their faculties eternally enhanced, I welcome them into the family. They seek me out, but the pleasure is always mine and only occasionally theirs.</p>
	<p class="block29">From my vantage point I could see the mutts’ faces, slowly and painfully mutating. I enjoyed listening to their screams of agony as their bones twisted and broke, their backs hunched, and their as their bones twisted and broke, their backs hunched, and their hands and feet became paws. They are among the ugliest of supernatural beings, and all should be vanquished from the face of the earth, but that would take time. My family was growing, but it was not yet at the capacity to which it would need to be to destroy the werewolf line. Besides, I was having the time of my afterlife adding to my exquisite collection. Now these four threatened to break off a branch of the family tree. Over my undead body!</p>
	<p class="block29">I sensed the others circling nearby, vampires and werewolves alike. The eight who stood before me were only a small number of those who would undoubtedly come forward to defend their own kind. Four facing four, fangs bared, ready for battle, my children stood idly by waiting for the others to complete their transformation. Fools! Respect is one thing, but not when your life belongs to me. Who were these rebels, these careless, angst ridden bastards? If they lived through this fight I might just kill them myself. If only I could see their faces.</p>
	<p class="block29">I turned to find a following of sweet and supple young vampires waiting, hoping to be chosen as my evening concubines. Raising my head, I flashed my fangs. They dispersed quickly. Tonight would not be their night. I rushed through the alleyways to the side of the local pub. Its windows were dark. The owner must have heard the ruckus in the streets and shut the place down. Good. The last thing I needed was a drunken gang of humans distracting us. Peering out into the square, I caught sight of one of the men. Blasphemy! This wasn’t a group of newborns, but my trusted, original circle who stood in front of the beings who could end their lives only during the full moon. Tonight!</p>
	<p class="block29">The normally icy blood boiled in my veins, for these were the most precious of my lot, my prize studs, who I called upon regularly. They were not to be lost to a dog-fight. A door slammed behind me as a man ran out of the back of the bar. I saw the worried faces of his friends gazing out the window, smiled wickedly over at them, and in a flash I was on him, biting down into the delicate arteries and veins in his neck. The screams my act elicited only made me want to kill him more. I waved over two of my beautiful girls and handed him over to them. Turning back to the men in the window with blood running down my chin, I hissed and ran towards them. Laughing at the comical display of men tripping over tables, chairs and one another, I resumed my position and awaited the first move.</p>
	<p class="block29">The hounds growled viciously as my boys stood smirking back at them. I knew not what their plan of attack would be, and I grew increasingly anxious as the seconds ticked away. My coven slowly emerged from the shadows, and the sound of the panting wolves pulsed in my ears. It was revolting. I felt many eyes trained on me as they awaited some sort of signal, however I was just as ill at ease as they were, and obviously less informed.</p>
	<p class="block29">At once, the werewolves pounced, knowing that it would take just one small bite to take down the eldest, strongest and most beloved of my flock. I started to advance towards them, but was halted by a small army of young vampires, holding tight around my waist, my wrists and ankles. They knew they were risking their eternal lives by attempting to thwart my advances, yet they held their ground and kept me at bay. I watched as the dogs came crashing down on those beautiful bodies, and I yelled out. A hand reached around and covered my mouth. A brave soul risking his limb, as I would have gladly bitten it off had I not seen what had become of the warriors.</p>
	<p class="block29">Four heads rolled away from their bodies, bloodied and severed, each returning to its human form. Four stunning men stood victoriously with silver blades in hand, daring the rest of the pack to attack. I watched as dozens of silver blades were extracted from baggy clothes all around the square, and doggies dropped off one-by-one as my brood ran out from the tree-line. Several of my own were injured, seven fatally as their hearts were torn from their bodies by the canines’ gaping maws. I wrestled my way out onto the square, caressing each of their faces and allowing them one final kiss before death stole them away.</p>
	<p class="block29">The carnage was massive. Bodies lay scattered throughout the village square. The streets ran with blood, and the mutts paid the ultimate sacrifice. I ran to my boys, embraced them each in turn before violently biting into their necks. Let that be a lesson to them. They would not be welcomed into my good graces or my body for many nights to come. I would spread the wealth, and let them fester for a while. They each knew what they were missing, and believe me, they would certainly miss it. I kicked one of the severed heads into the street as I made my way back to my lair, carefully choosing my mates for the night. Both he and she were more than willing.</p>
	<p class="block29">As I gazed out the window of my boudoir, I could see a bright orange light as the bodies of the fallen were burned for all to see. My attention was short-lived; I had my own fires to set. The two chosen ones awaited as three humans were led into the room. It was only right to feed before the night’s activities. I stood before them, assigning each victim to their death, keeping the female for myself. I whispered in her ear, “You’ve no idea how lucky you are, my pet,” before making the kill. As we enjoyed our blood meals, I heard distant howls of anguish and loss. I laughed at their pain.</p>
	<p class="block37">Perhaps that will teach them never to mess with The Queen of the Night.</p>
