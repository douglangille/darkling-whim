	<p class="block20">Matthew X. Gomez</p>
	<p class="block12"> </p>
	<p class="block12"> </p>
	<p class="block56">“HEY MISTER!” A girl called out. She looked underfed, her skinned-knees indicating a hard scrabbled life in the dust and the dirt. Her hair was a burnt orange color, the same shade as the dusty ground, and freckles speckled her face. She perched on the split rail fence leading into the no-horse town. I shouldered my worn leather tinker pack and kept walking, one foot following the other.</p>
	<p class="block57">“Hey Mister!” she called again, more insistent and demanding this time. “Where’s your sword?”</p>
	<p class="block57">I stopped, leaning lightly against the spear that doubled as my walking stick. It was half again as tall as I was with steel bands wrapped around the shaft and a cast iron butt-cap. The head of the spear was forged steel with a razor sharp point and barbs along the top edge. A short-hafted axe hung from a strap on my belt, its narrow crescent blade gleaming in the sunlight. A dagger as long as my forearm hung from the opposite side.</p>
	<p class="block57">“My what?” I asked, adjusting the brim on my hat. The sun was bright, and I wanted to get a better look at my impromptu interrogator. She was about eleven or twelve, not quite a child but not quite a woman either.</p>
	<p class="block57">“Your sword, Mister. Don’t all heroes carry one?” She kicked her bare feet against the fence post, making it thrum. “You’re here for the dragon, aren’t you?”</p>
	<p class="block57">“I’m here for the dragon, all right. I wouldn’t call myself a hero though,” I said, pulling on the mule's rope to get it walking again. I was sure the beast's previous owner had told me its name, but as far as I was concerned ‘Mule’ was as good a thing to call it as anything else. It answered to ‘Mule’ in any event, and all it needed to do was carry my gear.</p>
	<p class="block57">Now that I was closer, I could get a better look at the town. It had the usual general store and inn, and I counted two taverns at least. One of them probably doubled as a brothel, but mid-morning was hardly the usual time for such business to be conducted. From the ringing notes of a hammer striking metal there was a smithy nearby, and an acrid tang announced the presence of a tannery.</p>
	<p class="block57">My stomach grumbled fitfully, reminding me the last time I ate anything was the night before. My feet ached from the miles trudged into dust behind me. I tethered Mule to the hitching post outside the closer of the two taverns and made my way inside.</p>
	<p class="block57">“That’s an awfully big stick you’re carrying, Mister,” the man behind the bar said. He was a big man gone soft, probably a former soldier-for-hire who found a quiet spot to retire. A functional looking two-handed axe hung behind the bar within easy reach. The ceiling was relatively low, the tip of my spear grazing the bare wood.  The common room was cramped, filled with long tables and benches, most of which were unoccupied.</p>
	<p class="block57">“Is it a problem?” I asked. The smell of roasting meat was a pleasant change from the tannery outside, but it did remind me how hungry I was and how tired I was of eating my own cooking. </p>
	<p class="block57">“No problem.” The tavern keeper smiled broadly revealing broken and missing teeth. “You’ve got coin?”</p>
	<p class="block57">“I’m here about the dragon.”</p>
	<p class="block57">The man’s eyes narrowed to slits and the grin vanished so completely I wondered if I’d ever seen it. “Another fool, are you? Well I don’t give credit, especially not to dead men. You want to eat, well, you either pay or you get out. People who come to kill the dragon don’t usually stick around for long, and none of them come back.”</p>
	<p class="block57">I snorted, pulled a pouch of coins out of my jerkin and placed it on the worn-smooth bar top. “I’ve coin enough.”</p>
	<p class="block57">The bartender’s smile reappeared. “Good enough for me then. Let me get you a plate. Roast meat and root vegetables, plus some of my own home brew?”</p>
	<p class="block56">I nodded. “I’ve been traveling a while. Can you recommend a place to stay?”</p>
	<p class="block57">The bartender yelled an order into the back kitchen before turning back to me. “What’s that?” he asked. “Oh well, there is just the one inn. A couple of people around here might be taking boarders as well, but I know the inn has vacancies.”</p>
	<p class="block57">“Is it any good?” </p>
	<p class="block57">The bartender shrugged. “It’s all right,” he said. “Nothing too fancy, but the beds aren’t full of vermin and you can get company if you don’t mind spending a bit of coin. The keeper is my brother-in-law. He’s not a bad sort, all considered.”</p>
	<p class="block57">“Thanks, I’ll keep it in mind,” I replied. A short, heavy set girl pushed through the door from the kitchen and deposited a platter of meat and vegetables in front of me along with a tankard of the home brew.  The meat looked tough and stringy, and the vegetables were more than a tad suspect. If the surrounding area was having trouble with a dragon, I should be happy there was still food. The beer though, was rich, dark, and strong with a pleasant malt taste to it.</p>
	<p class="block57">“I’m guessing the farms around here are getting hit hard,” I said around a particularly tough bit of beef. I already knew the answer, had seen the signs as I approached the town. I’d seen more than one homestead reduced to a burnt out shell, the ruins still smoldering in places. Someplace else, you might think it was raiders, but there weren’t any bodies. A full grown dragon wouldn’t let all that meat go to waste.</p>
	<p class="block57">“Six so far,” the bartender confirmed. He noted my empty tankard and swapped me for a full one. Good man, that. “About one a week. Mayor’s been trying to get more of the outliers to come in, and some have. Most of them are a stubborn lot though.”</p>
	<p class="block57">“They wouldn’t be farmers if they weren’t stubborn,” said a voice behind me. I turned to see a corpulent red faced dressed in fur and wearing a thick silver chain of office around a neck swallowed by a triple chin. He’d be the mayor then. Flanking him were two toughs, axes and long knives hanging from their belts and both staring hard at me from lowered brows. I think they were trying to be intimidating. “You are a slayer then?” the mayor asked.</p>
	<p class="block57">“One of the best,” I replied.</p>
	<p class="block57">“You don’t look so tough to me,” the tough on the right said. “What makes you one of the best?”</p>
	<p class="block57">Sighing, even though I half-anticipated the question, I reached into my jerkin and produced a leather folio. The mayor’s goons went for their axes at my approach, and I smiled when the mayor told them to stand down. Spreading out the contents of the folio revealed three scales, each the size of my hand. The first was the color of a blazing hearth fire, the second was as black as a chunk of coal, and the third was the color of new grass in spring. </p>
	<p class="block57">“Three dragons?” the mayor breathed, his eyes wide in his piggy face. “Truly you are a prodigy, sir.” </p>
	<p class="block57">“Or a liar,” muttered one of the toughs. I smiled at him.</p>
	<p class="block56">The mayor reached out to touch one of the scales, but I swept them into the folio and tucked it back into my jerkin.</p>
	<p class="block57">“Where is the rest of your crew?” one of mayor’s guards asked. The question made me reassess his intelligence. Maybe he wasn’t dumb muscle after all. It was true: most dragon hunters worked in teams of at least ten to fifteen. Some professional bands held upwards of thirty full-time members with any number of additional hangers-on and camp followers. Anything less than ten was generally considered folly at best and suicide at worst.</p>
	<p class="block57">“It’s just me,” I said, taking a long pull from my tankard. “Have any other hunters tried to rid you of your dragon problem?”</p>
	<p class="block57">“The Band of the Red Hand went up into the hills ten days ago,” the mayor replied. “They haven’t come back and the dragon attacked another farm three days ago.”</p>
	<p class="block57">I had never heard of the Red Hand, but wasn’t surprised. Usually when word got out of a dragon sighting, amateurs started crawling out of the woodwork like termites from a rotten log. Most were young sons of minor nobility looking to make a name for themselves. Others were soldiers, most of whom had experience fighting ogres or possibly the odd giant. Nothing could prepare them for the sheer pants-soiling terror of going up against a winged avatar of destruction. The most successful hunters made sure to employ at least one wizard. Of course, it was something of a challenge to find a wizard who would rather risk being flambéed by a giant lizard than live safely in quiet contemplation.</p>
	<p class="block57">“How many in the band?” I asked.</p>
	<p class="block57">“Fifteen,” the mayor replied. “They had someone claiming to be a wizard with them.”</p>
	<p class="block57">“All right,” I replied. Nothing they were saying was dissuading me from making my own journey up into the hills. Even after ten days it would be easy enough to follow the trail of fifteen men.</p>
	<p class="block57">I turned back to the bar but the mayor and his flunkies hadn’t moved. “Was there something else?” I asked. </p>
	<p class="block57">“Err, yes… that is we were wondering how long you were planning to stay in town,” the mayor explained. I didn’t have to see him to smell the nervous sweat on his skin. Could be he was as scared of me as he was of the dragon. Could be he had good reason to be.</p>
	<p class="block57">“Just tonight,” I said, trying to sound reassuring but probably sounding tired. “I thought I’d get a good night sleep, resupply, and head out in the morning.” </p>
	<p class="block57">The mayor cleared his throat, trying to give his voice the extra weight of authority it sorely lacked. “I don’t want any trouble,” he said. “Some of you hunters can get a bit out of hand.”</p>
	<p class="block57">I snorted. “Worse than a dragon?”</p>
	<p class="block57">“He said, ‘No trouble,’” one of the toughs, the smart one, repeated. </p>
	<p class="block57">“Yeah, yeah, I heard him.”</p>
	<p class="block57">The mayor and his bodyguards left the tavern without so much as a fare thee well or a good luck. They didn’t hurl any curses at my back either, so there was that. The bartender checked my tankard and passed me another full one. Like I said: good man. “Don’t mind the mayor,” he said. “The last group through here got a bit out of hand.” </p>
	<p class="block57">“Not my problem,” I said, slowly sipping my beer, making a mental list of what I’d need. Food for one thing, as my rations were getting perilously low and I didn’t have a good sense of how long it was going to take me to find the dragon. I could sense it out there, a tingling down at the base of my spine. It wasn’t precise though, and I knew I’d be out in the wilderness for a time. </p>
	<p class="block57">“You think you’ll find the Red Hand out there?”</p>
	<p class="block57">I took a long time answering, savoring my beer and the buzz it brought before answering. “Fifteen men aren’t going to be sneaking up on anything, least of all a dragon. Even if I do come across them, I don’t think any of them are coming back alive. Dragons don’t much like being hunted.”</p>
	<p class="block57">“But you’ve killed three of them. How’d you do that?”</p>
	<p class="block57">I gave the bartender a twisted grin and rested my finger across my lips. “Trade secret,” I said. “My thanks for the beer and the food.” I paused, looked around at the tavern, imagined it engulfed in flames. </p>
	<p class="block57">“I should go see about those supplies. Will my mule be all right out there?”</p>
	<p class="block57">“Shouldn’t be an issue,” the bartender replied.</p>
	<p class="block57">I thanked him, paid my tab, and exited the tavern. The sky was cornflower blue, the sun, high and hot, baking the ground and bleaching the wood of the buildings. I made my way across the street to the general store, feeling eyes on me. Word had evidently spread of my presence and strangers were probably rare so my arrival elicited curiosity. As long as they were content to look and didn’t feel the need to pester me, well, then it didn’t bother me any. I was used to being stared at.</p>
	<p class="block57">The general store was much like other stores on the frontier. Sides of salted beef and pork hung from the high beams of the ceiling. Sacks of grain were stacked high. Staples like salt and sugar were neatly organized on shelves. I noted picks and shovels, saw blades and wagon tongues. A solitary cat gazed at me enigmatically from atop one of the stacks of grain. </p>
	<p class="block57">A stout middle aged woman, her hair tucked up under a blue scarf, came out of the back. She tried twisting her frown of disapproval into a welcoming smile, failed, and settled for a neutral sort of contempt. “What do you want then?” she asked. </p>
	<p class="block57">“I need supplies. I’ll take six pounds each of pork and beef, some salt, sugar and a week’s worth of hardtack. Do you have any coffee?”</p>
	<p class="block57">The woman grunted. “What does this look like to you, the Capitol? There is a merchant comes around once a month or so. He brings some coffee. I usually sell out the same day. Mayor buys it all. You should know I don’t take credit.”</p>
	<p class="block57">“I know, I know,” I said. “I’ve got coin to pay.” The woman’s dour expression brightened by a fraction. </p>
	<p class="block57">“You’re the dragon hunter everyone’s going on about, aren’t you?” she asked as she started bundling my supplies.</p>
	<p class="block57">“I’ll take fifty feet of that rope too,” I said, pointing to the coil in question. “Wait, what? News does travel fast around here.”</p>
	<p class="block57">She shrugged. “What did you expect? It’s a small town. Do you think you’ll find the Band of the Red Hand?”</p>
	<p class="block57">I picked up an iron pot, turning it over in my hands, before setting it back down. “Alive you mean? Not likely.”</p>
	<p class="block57">I turned to see the woman biting her lip, her eyes moist, making me regret my honesty.</p>
	<p class="block57">“Your man went with them?” I asked. </p>
	<p class="block57">She shook her head. “My son. I forbade him from going, we fought, and he went anyway. He’s not even sixteen.” The woman wasn’t quite blubbering, but was close to it. Feeling clumsy and awkward I reached out and touched her arm. </p>
	<p class="block57">“I’ll look for him,” I said. It wasn’t going to make much difference. Dragons weren’t known for leaving survivors or taking prisoners, and the odds of a boy, even one born and raised on the frontier, surviving out in the wilderness were slim. </p>
	<p class="block57">“Thank you,” she said. </p>
	<p class="block57">I picked out a few more items: a spare flint and steel, the pot I’d been eyeing, and I even splurged on a small steel mirror and a new razor. Most importantly I picked up a local map of the area. Even if it wasn’t completely accurate, it would give me a better sense of where I was going than without one.  “The local smith made this?” I asked, holding the razor up in the light so it gleamed off of the blade. “Exceptional work.”</p>
	<p class="block57">“My husband’s work,” the woman said, the pride evident in her voice. “He was a smith in the army before he mustered out.”</p>
	<p class="block57">I paid for the goods and arranged to have them picked up in the morning. As it happened to be midafternoon, I found myself with some time on my hands. I resisted the urge to go back to the tavern, as tempting as it was to be around people. An early start was called for, and time spent in a tavern has a way of getting away from me. I still needed to answer the question as to what I was going to do with myself for the remainder of the day. </p>
	<p class="block57">I left the store angry at myself for promising the woman I’d look for her brat, and angry at her for asking. I tried to imagine myself in her place, but soon shook my head at the effort of it. It had been a long time since I’d seen my family, and I had long since abandoned any notions of starting again. I broke free of my reverie as I passed into the cool interior of the inn. </p>
	<p class="block57">I saw my friend, the mayor, having swapped his furs and chain of office for more functional linen tunic and breeches. His two bravos lounged in the lobby, one of them offering me a half-hearted wave. There was no animosity there, only casual professionalism. I tipped my hat back at the one who waved. </p>
	<p class="block57">A tired looking woman, half falling out of her dress, her face flushed with drink, pushed to her feet and made a half-hearted attempt to saunter over to me. She pressed herself against me, but I grabbed her wrist as she slid her hand into my jerkin. </p>
	<p class="block57">“What?” she breathed into my face. She was trying to be seductive, but the cheap rotgut she’d been drinking made me want to gag. </p>
	<p class="block57">“Bit early, isn’t it?” I asked, pushing her away. </p>
	<p class="block57">“Since when is it ever too early for a bit of fun, big man?” she asked. “Or do you not like my particular flavor?” She let out a too loud and brash laugh before slumping back into her chair, skinny legs lewdly spread and eyes half-closed. </p>
	<p class="block57">“A room for the night then is it?” I wasn’t sure when the mayor appeared next to me, but there he was. “That’ll be two merchants,” he said as I reached for my purse. “Company’s extra, of course,” he said, indicating the whore with a shake of his jowls.</p>
	<p class="block57">“Two merchants?” I grumbled. Usually that much coin would buy you a room for a week with some left over. “You wouldn’t be trying to gouge me here, would you?”</p>
	<p class="block57">The mayor’s eyes hardened. “Times are tough. You don’t like the price, you can find lodging elsewhere. We don’t serve food here either so don’t ask. And I need the coin up front.”</p>
	<p class="block57">Grumbling, I fished two silver coins out of my purse and dropped them into the ham-sized hand of the mayor. He smiled, displaying two rows of perfectly white teeth. His eyes didn’t get any softer though. </p>
	<p class="block57">“Are you going to want company tonight?” he asked. </p>
	<p class="block57">The whore was snoring softly in the chair. Her dress had fallen a bit more, revealing almost all of one sagging breast.</p>
	<p class="block57">“Oh, not her,” the mayor assured me. “I have other girls working for me. She works the day shift. Unless of course you prefer boys…”</p>
	<p class="block57">Shaking my head, I tried and failed to keep my feelings of distaste from showing on my face. “Won’t be necessary,” I said. “I’ll take the room. I do expect my mule to be seen to, though, and don’t think you’ll be charging me more for that.”</p>
	<p class="block57">“I’ll have it seen to,” the mayor said. </p>
	<p class="block57">The room itself was small and spartan; a bed, a wardrobe, a chamber pot, and a wash bowl. The door at least latched from the inside, ensuring a modicum of privacy. I took off my weapon belt, sat on the bed, pushed off my boots and stretched. My body ached from travelling and the bed was warm and soft: a far cry from my usual accommodations of hard ground for my bed and my pack for a pillow. </p>
	<p class="block57"><span class="calibre28">I closed my eyes for what felt like a moment, but when I opened them, it was dark outside my window. I listened carefully to the noises of the inn, but other than the distinct sound of a headboard banging into a wall somewhere below me, the building was quiet.  My stomach grumbled fitfully, but I promised I would take care of it come morning. </span></p>
	<p class="block57">That night, the nightmares came. The old farm blazing. My wife, my parents, engulfed in fire. My sister, snatched from the ground and dropped from such a height it shattered all of her bones. Again, I saw myself race into the farmstead, saw myself grab my grandfather’s spear. Stumbling back into the courtyard, choking on the smoke, looking for the winged devil who destroyed my home, my family. </p>
	<p class="block57">It saw me, its awful yellow eyes gleaming as it swooped down on me. I braced the spear, the point piercing its chest, and the impact sending me sprawling, its body covering mine. I remember the blood, black hot and thick, so much of it entering my mouth, filling me with dread power.</p>
	<p class="block57">I sat up, hands clutching the sheets, covered in sweat. Only a dream. Settling back into the bed, I closed my eyes, slowly started counting back from one thousand. At some point, sleep took me.</p>
	<p class="block57">When I woke again, it was to a light rapping on my door. I grumbled something unintelligible, sat up, pulled on my boots and walked to the door. </p>
	<p class="block57">“What is it?” I half growled, grabbing my axe from my belt and holding it loose and dangerous back behind my leg. Admittedly, I am not at my best first thing in the morning. </p>
	<p class="block57">“It is morning, sir,” a voice, young and female, said. “Master Biggles asked me to wake you up.”</p>
	<p class="block57">“Who?” I asked, rubbing the dirt from the corner of my eyes. </p>
	<p class="block57">“The mayor.”</p>
	<p class="block57">“Oh.” I unlatched the door. Standing there was a pretty girl, couldn’t have been any older than sixteen. She had the same red hair and freckles as the girl who had greeted me outside of town. I wondered if they were sisters. She was carrying a tray laden with cold meat, cheese and what looked and smelled like porridge. My stomach chose that moment to remind me of my earlier pledge. </p>
	<p class="block57">“All that for me?” I asked, stepping aside so she could enter the room. </p>
	<p class="block57">She nodded. “Master Sloe over at the tavern thought you would want something to eat before you went on your way.”</p>
	<p class="block57">Smiling, I picked up a slice of ham, folded it over, and popped it into my mouth. I turned to see the girl still looking at me. “Was there anything else?” I asked. </p>
	<p class="block57">“Is it true you are here to kill the dragon?”</p>
	<p class="block57">I laughed. “Why does everyone keep asking? Do you get a lot of heavily armed strangers just passing through?”</p>
	<p class="block57">She shrugged. “We get them on occasion. Most of them are veterans and deserters looking for a new life. We hoped the Red Hand would have taken care of the problem, but the dragon is still out there and the Band hasn’t come back.”</p>
	<p class="block57">I cut a thick slice off of the loaf of bread. I placed a generous amount of the ham and cheese on top of it, then topped it off with another thick slice of bread. </p>
	<p class="block57">“What’s that?” she asked. </p>
	<p class="block57">“This?” I responded, pausing with the food halfway to my mouth. “A trick I learned from an old campaigner.”</p>
	<p class="block57">“Seems a bit odd,” she said. </p>
	<p class="block57">“So was he.” I took a bite, set it back on the platter and finished getting ready. I buckled my weapon belt, and slung my satchel over my shoulder before picking up my spear and taking another bite out<b class="calibre29"> </b>of my sandwich. </p>
	<p class="block57">“Have you killed any dragons?” She stepped between me and the door. </p>
	<p class="block57">I looked down at her and thought about lying. “Three.”</p>
	<p class="block57">“You think you’ll be able to kill this one?”</p>
	<p class="block57">I tried to push past her, but she deftly stepped in front of me again. “Well I won’t be able to if you keep me from leaving,” I said. “But yes, I don’t expect this one to be any different.”</p>
	<p class="block57">I finally managed to get past her and make my way downstairs. Mule was waiting for me outside, already laden with the supplies I’d purchased. </p>
	<p class="block57">Finishing my sandwich, I unhitched him. “Ready then?” I asked.</p>
	<p class="block57">Mule gave me a baleful look and rolled his eyes, which I figured was as close to agreement as I was going to get. There were no crowds gathered to see us off, no women offering a favor to bring me luck or to safely see me on my way. I figured they’d been disappointed enough when the Red Hand failed to exterminate the dragon, and had decided one man wasn’t going to have much more success. </p>
	<p class="block57"><span class="calibre28">From what I gathered, the dragon was attacking farms up to the north of the town so I decided to start my search there.  The road out of town wasn’t anything more than hard-packed dirt, and the grass alongside was the yellow-browned result of too much sun and not enough rain. The map I picked up wasn’t the most accurate or detailed, but it did show a number of farms a few miles out. I selected one, owned by someone named Mudder, apparently, and made it my goal for the day. At around midday, I stopped to let Mule have a rest and to eat something myself. The landscape hadn’t changed, and if it wasn’t for the fact I could no longer see the town, it was as if I hadn’t made any progress. I studied the sky, but it was empty except for a few fluffy cotton clouds. I didn’t even see any birds. I sighed, picked up my spear and used it to leverage myself to my feet. </span></p>
	<p class="block57">The afternoon was much like the morning, only hotter. It wasn’t long though before I saw a few wisps of black smoke coming from the general direction of my intended destination. I cursed and tugged on Mule’s reins. I’d been hoping to sleep indoors, but that didn’t seem likely. My suspicions were confirmed when I came over the crest of the hill. The farm house and associated buildings were little more than charred timbers. The chimney was still mostly intact, and the surrounding fields had been spared destruction, but even from a distance I could make out the still, blackened bones in the courtyard.</p>
	<p class="block57">Mule started getting ornery, not wanting to get closer. The smell of wood smoke and burnt flesh grew stronger. Taking a bit of cloth, I tied it around my mouth and nose as I moved around the remains. There were ten bodies on the ground, all of them adults. I saw the smashed open cellar door, black smoke rising from the hole. Bile rose up in my throat and forced it back down, forced myself to look at the scene with something resembling professional detachment.</p>
	<p class="block57"><span class="calibre28">It seemed evident some of the homesteaders at least tried to present a defense.  I saw more than a few half-molten blobs of iron and steel, as </span><span class="calibre28">well as about a dozen arrows scattered here and there.  The prints on the ground were a confused mess, and I was having a hard time getting a sense of how big a dragon I was dealing with. It was conceivable even a younger dragon could wreak this much destruction, but I found it unlikely. Then it struck me. Not only was there no livestock, there </span>weren’t any animal bodies at all. The dragon must have carried most of them off, which gave me a better sense of its size. Even a thirty foot dragon would struggle with a full grown milk cow, preferring to feast on it on the spot. The dragon I was after was considerably larger if all of the livestock was gone. Chances were, its lair wasn’t too far away either.  Of course, tracking any flying creature is next to impossible. Luckily for me, I knew a way to cheat.</p>
	<p class="block57">After I filled my waterskins from the well, first ensuring there weren’t any bodies in there fouling the water, I spent about an hour scraping through the ash and dirt and checking under the corpses of the farmers. I finally found what I was looking for, a thick scale the size of my palm. Given what the villagers told me about the dragon, and now what I saw, I wasn’t surprised to see it was a deep burnished red. It  wasn’t that reds were more or less dangerous than any other type of dragon, but they did have a well-deserved reputation for malice and a taste for destruction and wanton murder.</p>
	<p class="block57">Having found what I wanted, I left the charred bones and ruined homestead behind me. Mule was where I left him, idly sniffing at the sere grass. I drew my dagger from my belt and dug a rough circle around me, making sure it was unbroken. I drew the sigils of tracking and sigils of the Tyrant Lizard along the outside of the circle, then drew a second circle on the outside of the first one. Kneeling, I placed the dragon scale before me. I pricked my finger with the long knife, letting the drops of blood fall on the scale. I twisted my mouth, my tongue and teeth aching as I spat out the magic words. That’s the thing about magic they don’t tell you in the stories. Magic hurts. Most mortal frames aren’t intended to channel forces capable of fundamentally changing the way the world works. Sure, there are alternatives, but most of those are deeply unpleasant and require a steady supply of victims to take the strain for you. I’ve heard of some practitioners who went so far as to give up mortality in an attempt to avoid the burdens of magic, but that came with other problems.</p>
	<p class="block57">The magic I gathered coalesced around the dragon scale as little motes of light grew more numerous and luminous as I watched. The scale started shaking, then spinning, before finally coming to a rest, a now faint glow permeating it. I picked it up, scuffing the circle with my foot. I turned, holding the scale up in front of me. As I pointed it in a northerly direction, it began to shake and its glow intensified. I smiled, walked over to Mule and took the pack saddles off of him. I unpacked my bed roll, made sure Mule was watered, fed, and hobbled, had a bite of something to eat myself, and lay down to sleep.</p>
	<p class="block57">I woke to the sound of rustling in the tall grass. I rolled to my feet, hands loose on the haft of my spear, half a dozen spells of attack and defense springing to mind. Standing a fair distance away was a man, a wild shock of red hair standing from his head, and naked as a jaybird. He tilted his head to one side and studied me. </p>
	<p class="block57"><span class="calibre28">“You are a slayer?” he asked, speaking the ancient language of the dragons.  “Come to slay the dragon, man-meat?” he asked this time in the language common to the area, though his accent was strange. As he stepped closer, I saw the red scales covering his arms, legs, chest and neck, saw where his hands ended in black talons. </span></p>
	<p class="block57">“Could be I have,” I replied, in dragon.</p>
	<p class="block57">He laughed then, a deep dark sound full of dread and malice. His eyes narrowed and I saw they were red also, and slitted like a lizard’s. “Man-meat came alone? I’ve killed fifteen of your brothers!” he roared and I could feel the heat of his breath even from the distance separating us.</p>
	<p class="block57">I shrugged. “Weren’t my kin, and I’ve killed three of your kind,” I replied. </p>
	<p class="block57">That brought him up short. “You lie,” he hissed. As I watched something moved under his skin, unnatural ripples and waves and I wondered how close he was to losing control.</p>
	<p class="block56">I reached into my jerkin, pulled out the three dragon scales there, tossed them on the ground between us.</p>
	<p class="block57">The dragon sniffed. “Scales prove nothing.”</p>
	<p class="block57">I chuckled. “Be that way if you must. I am still coming for you though. And think about this, how else could I speak your tongue?”</p>
	<p class="block57">The dragon waved a dismissive hand. “You may try to slay me, man-meat, but like others before you, you will die. There is a ring of standing stones a few miles to the north of here. I will meet you there tomorrow when the sun is highest. Do not make me come looking for you.” He stepped away, back into the darkness until I couldn’t see him anymore. There was the sound of air being suddenly displaced, followed by the sound of an enormous pair of wings flapping against the air. Realizing I wasn’t going to get much sleep, I went ahead and gathered some scrub brush and started a fire.</p>
	<p class="block57">Morning broke and found me sitting, staring at the dying fire. I decided to make myself eat something, despite having no appetite. I walked over to the pack saddles, pulled out a bit of food and some water and chewed, made myself swallow. I unwrapped my shield, a large oblong piece of embossed wood that covered me from my chin to the top of my ankles. Its only ornamentation was an inverted red spear. I next unpacked my chain armor. I wasn’t looking forward to carrying it, but wearing it was going to be worse. Still, it might protect me some from the dragon’s teeth and claws. I checked it for rust and wear, before repacking it into a bundle I could carry on my spear.  My armaments consisted of my spear, my axe, and my dagger. I cut Mule free from his hobbles. I wasn’t sure if I’d be back to collect him, and he’d served me well. He deserved at least a fighting chance to make it back to town. I stepped back and away, trying to think of something profound to say, realized it was just a mule I’d never bothered to properly name anyway.</p>
	<p class="block57">I turned north and started walking. I chewed a bit of the pork as I walked, washed it down with water, and wished I had a beer. I thought about turning around, giving it all up, but laughed at myself and kept walking. I thought about the whore back in town. I tried to remember the last time I was between a woman’s legs, couldn’t, and gave up before I started to get myself down. I started whistling a tune I remembered hearing years ago, something about a woman’s one night stand with a soldier.</p>
	<p class="block57">I crested a rise, saw the standing stones. They were monolithic and looked to all have been cut from granite. They were impressive, if crude, in their own way. The ground between the stones was covered in bleached bones and some industrious soul had stacked a series of skulls into a neat pyramid. A morbid place to be sure, but I wondered at the significance and why the locals hadn’t seen fit to mention it.</p>
	<p class="block57">I sat down a fair bit away and made myself drink a bit more water. I checked the sun’s position, decided I was early. I got up, stretched, and checked my weapons, my armor, and my shield. I stripped off my jerkin and my shirt. I opened my satchel and rummaged in it until I found the clay jar I was looking for. I broke the wax seal on it and smeared the foul smelling unguent on my face, hands, arms, and chest. It wouldn’t protect me much against the dragon roasting me alive if I got hit fully with its flame, but it would keep my skin from blistering from the heat. It was almost worth the price of smelling like rancid butter. My shirt went back on, followed by my chain. </p>
	<p class="block57">I looked up and in the distance I could see the dragon circling high overhead. I strapped my shield to my arm, made sure my weapon belt was securely fastened, and waited for the dragon to come to me.</p>
	<p class="block57"><span class="calibre28">The dragon dropped from the sky like a meteor, all teeth and claws and reptilian fury.  I spoke a spell of binding that made me feel like I’d been punched by an ogre, but it did the trick. Brilliant blue bands of energy wrapped themselves around the dragon, snapping its wings into its body. I thought I heard one of the wings snap, and it was all I could do to sprint out of the way before the out of control dragon crashed into the space where I was a moment ago. </span></p>
	<p class="block57">The dragon pushed itself to its feet as I took a guarded position, my shield in front and my spear in an overhand position, the haft resting on the shield’s brim. The dragon’s left wing was definitely broken, eliminating one of its main advantages. Unfortunately, it was still deadly.</p>
	<p class="block56">The dragon drew back its head to unleash a gout of flame. I shouted a spell that pushed me back four feet and left me tasting copper on my tongue. The spell had the desired effect of plummeting the temperature in the area immediately around me. When the flame hit the aura of cold, it was quickly dissipated, leaving me unharmed, even if there was a bit of frost still on my spear and shield.</p>
	<p class="block57">I went on the offensive, pushing forward toward the dragon. The dragon swiped at my unshielded side with its claws, but I bounced my shield against its talons and drove my spear forward, aiming for the dragon’s eye. The dragon snapped his head back as the tip of my spear deflected harmlessly off of its scales. Snake-quick the dragon attacked again, its teeth sinking into my right arm. I howled in pain, hearing the chain links snap under the force of those terrible jaws. I managed to slam my shield again and again into the dragon’s snout until, with a roar of agony, it dropped me and backed away, hatred shining bright in his molten red eyes. I tried lifting my spear, but my savaged arm refused to obey. I dropped my shield and switched my spear to my left hand. </p>
	<p class="block57">“Where did you learn dragon magic, man-meat?” the dragon hissed at me. I could see my blood on its fangs, and I considered its long sharp claws. “You don’t taste like the others,” he continued. “Strange, yet familiar all the same.”</p>
	<p class="block57">“Care to try for another taste?” I asked. “Or are you ready to yield?”</p>
	<p class="block57">The dragon charged. I hurled the spear with both hands and a shouted spell that left me kneeling on the ground, clutching my chest. The dragon bowled me over, leaving me sprawled and stunned from the pain. It felt like a giant had used me as an anvil. I scrabbled for my axe and forced myself to my feet.</p>
	<p class="block57">The spear, aided by that bit of magic, flew true, puncturing the dragon’s eye and lodging itself deep. The dragon roared and thrashed, trying ineffectually to grab the spear and pull it free. I stepped back, bent over, hands on my knees and breathing heavily. Eventually the dragon’s thrashing diminished, his tail stopped slamming down hard enough to make the bones jump a foot off the ground. He clawed at the dirt, his talons gouging deep furrows into the earth. The terrible beast lay still, its body finally getting the news the brain was dead.</p>
	<p class="block57">I smiled, straightened, and groaned from the effort. It hurt to breathe, and I suspected at least one of my ribs was broken. I limped over to the dragon, the rush of combat abandoning me, as I felt how much damage I suffered. Taking hold of the spear shaft with both hands, I pulled hard, twisting it back and forth to work it free. At least twice, I thought about leaving it there. Finally, it came out of the body, and I was pleased to see it still intact.</p>
	<p class="block57">Luckily for me, the dragon’s thrashing placed it on its side, making the next part marginally easier. Using my dagger, I cut away some of the relatively softer belly scales. It was then axe work to hack through the dense chest tissue and to break the ribs to get to the treasure beneath. A few deft strokes and I pulled free the dragon’s heart. Smiling, I opened my mouth wide and took that first delectable bite.</p>
	<p class="block57">I felt the dragon’s power flow into me, all of its strengths, all of its memories. I could taste sweet meat and hot blood, could smell the victory of burning castles and men, women and children roasted by my flames. I felt an itch on my hand, pulled off my chain glove to see small scales forming on my skin. I felt an ache in my gums, and wondered if my teeth were reshaping themselves into fangs. I finished my meal and sat down, my back leaning against the cooling corpse of the dragon. I rinsed my mouth out with some water and pushed myself to my feet. Already my body felt invigorated, and I whistled a jaunty tune as I headed back toward town.</p>
	<p class="block25">If I was lucky, Mule wouldn’t have gotten far.</p>
