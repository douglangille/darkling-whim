	<p class="block21">Jennifer M. Zeiger has wanted to write novels since the seventh grade. </p>
	<p class="block21">Why then? Because that’s when she finally figured out reading and stopped having to guess on her tests. She found a world of magic in books. So, although she’s worked in retail, candy making, and rock climbing… her true passion lies in writing. Jennifer lives in the beautiful state of Colorado with her husband, dog, and two cats. She graduated with her Bachelors in English in 2008 with minors in Accounting and Recreation. (Gotta have a mix of everything, right? It helps the writing.) For inspiration, Jennifer loves to read John Flanagan, Brent Weeks, Anne Mccaffrey, Cassandra Clare, and Brandon Sanderson. Fantasy with a little scifi mixed in.</p>

	<p class="block46">THE CHILL AIR felt wonderful on his burned skin. The wounds, after a week, were darkened scabs. Pulling his sleeves up, he let the soft wind brush across the burns and settled back against a tree while he eyed the flicker of their campfire. Out here, where they couldn’t see, was his refuge, where he observed and planned.</p>
	<p class="block47">He’d left everything behind but the clothes he wore, a skin of water and weapons. He gathered food from the forest as he went and hunted each night. Now, after tracking the murderers for over a week, his clothes weren’t much to speak of, but his weapons were sharp. That’s all that mattered.</p>
	<p class="block47"><i class="calibre6">Kill them now.</i></p>
	<p class="block47">“Not yet. I want to see their home, to destroy it like they destroyed mine.” His whisper sounded harsh after such a long silence. At the mention of home, his mind’s eye brought up the cluster of log cabins he used to live in. He shook the image away before he could recall the black smoke and ashes that replaced the buildings. He didn’t want to see the blackened corpses he’d tried to pull free.</p>
	<p class="block47"><i class="calibre6">You’ll burn their home?</i></p>
	<p class="block47">“Of course.”</p>
	<p class="block47">He crept closer as the murderers settled into sleep. They looked so peaceful, so secure, as they laid out their bedrolls and banked the fire. They didn’t even post a sentry. It’d be so easy to slip in and slice their throats.</p>
	<p class="block47"><i class="calibre6">Too easy.</i></p>
	<p class="block47">He agreed. The murderers slipped in and sliced Mallory and Zane’s throats as they slept. His wife and son never even knew what happened. He wanted the murderers to know exactly what was happening when he killed them. </p>
	<p class="block24"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block12"> </p>
	<p class="block46">He followed them for two more days deep into the woods where ‘civilized’ people didn’t go. Great outcroppings of rocks interrupted the tress now and then, but otherwise it was a solid expanse of foliage. </p>
	<p class="block47">Crouching low, he watched from behind a rock as the five men followed a trail between two boulders. Only after they were gone from sight did he follow. </p>
	<p class="block47">The caution wasn’t needed. The men never looked back, but he was a careful man and if, by chance, they spotted him, his revenge wouldn’t be so sweet. </p>
	<p class="block47"><i class="calibre6">They’re slowing.</i></p>
	<p class="block47">“Must be close,” he agreed.</p>
	<p class="block47">The five continued on through the rocks until a cave opened up to their right. They disappeared inside.</p>
	<p class="block47"><i class="calibre6">This must be it.</i></p>
	<p class="block47">A thrill ran through him. He tasted the sweet tang of success on his tongue. Waiting for a bit, to let the five settle into their home, he approached the cave. Faint light flickered deep within.</p>
	<p class="block47">He trailed a hand along the wall. Dirt crunched beneath his steps but the chatter of voices below covered the sound. </p>
	<p class="block47">Finally, he spotted them. Except they were no longer five. One man carried a child on his shoulders as another hugged a woman while trying to steal food off the table behind her. A third sat on the floor with two boys. He kept pulling treasures from his pack for them to cry in delight over.</p>
	<p class="block47">Those treasures were stolen from the village they destroyed. The man pulled out a carved wooden horse and the two boys grabbed it at the same time. They pulled at it, fighting for possession. </p>
	<p class="block47">Zane’s carving. He shook his head and looked away, fighting tears. His son’s skilled fingers could carve any image. He’d inherited his mother’s slender hands.</p>
	<p class="block47"><i class="calibre6">Sweet revenge just became sweeter.</i></p>
	<p class="block47">“They killed my family for trinkets.”</p>
	<p class="block47">Something scraped the floor behind him. Jumping, he hugged himself against the dark wall of the tunnel and waited. </p>
	<p class="block47">There it was. In a small hole in the tunnel wall, something moved. Silently he reached into the hole while pulling his knife. He encountered flesh. A person. Latching onto the person’s arm, he pulled her out…and froze.</p>
	<p class="block47"><i class="calibre6">Kill her!</i></p>
	<p class="block47">He couldn’t. Bright eyes stared at him in terror. They slanted up at the corners, just like Mallory’s. The girl was tied and gagged. She whimpered when he didn’t lower his knife. </p>
	<p class="block47"><i class="calibre6">She’ll give you away. Kill her.</i></p>
	<p class="block47">Sheathing the knife, he shook his head. He motioned for silence with a finger against his lips and pulled the gag from her mouth.</p>
	<p class="block46">“What are you doing here?”</p>
	<p class="block47">She cringed away from his rough words.</p>
	<p class="block47">“They’re going to sell me,” she whispered.</p>
	<p class="block47">“Of all th—“ he cut off before his voice rose with his anger. Pulling his knife again, he cut her ties. She cringed at his sudden movement but then stared at her loose wrists. </p>
	<p class="block47">“What’s your name?” she asked.</p>
	<p class="block47">He thought for a second. “Patrick.”</p>
	<p class="block47">“Thanks, Pa—“</p>
	<p class="block47">“Go.” He pointed up the tunnel. Something in him didn’t want to hear her gratitude. “You don’t want to be here.” Forgetting her, he turned back to the murderers in the cave.</p>
	<p class="block47"><i class="calibre6">You’ll regret that.</i></p>
	<p class="block47">“No I won’t.”</p>
	<p class="block47">“What?”</p>
	<p class="block47">He swung around. The girl was watching over his shoulder, her eyes wide and lips pinched in concern.</p>
	<p class="block47">“Go.” He shoved her toward the tunnel.</p>
	<p class="block47">She stumbled back but then planted her feet.</p>
	<p class="block47">“What are you doing here?” she asked.</p>
	<p class="block47">“I followed them here after they killed my family.”</p>
	<p class="block47"><i class="calibre6">Don’t tell her. She’s just keeping you from your revenge. They deserve to die.</i></p>
	<p class="block47">“They’ll die,” he muttered.</p>
	<p class="block47">The girl’s mouth gaped. She glanced at the families below.</p>
	<p class="block47">“You—you mean to kill them?”</p>
	<p class="block47">“They murdered my family!” He shrank back from the cavern at the volume of his voice. Thankfully the chatter in the cave was still loud enough to cover his mistake. </p>
	<p class="block47">“But—but how does that make you any different? You’ll be a murderer of families too!” She spun and ran but not before her eyes clouded with tears. </p>
	<p class="block47">Patrick stared after her.</p>
	<p class="block47"><i class="calibre6">It’ll be justifiable revenge. They’ll kill more families for trinkets if you don’t.</i></p>
	<p class="block47">“But what does that make me?”</p>
	<p class="block47"><i class="calibre6">The hand of justice.</i></p>
	<p class="block47">“It’s still murder and of children no less.”</p>
	<p class="block47"><i class="calibre6">They’ll grow up to be their fathers.</i></p>
	<p class="block47">He shuddered and clutched his knife in a white knuckled grip. </p>
	<p class="block47">“They deserve it.” he pulled his sword.</p>
	<p class="block47"><i class="calibre6">Yes.</i></p>
	<p class="block47">But the girl’s eyes haunted him. Tear-filled eyes of innocence named him murderer. Zane would have given him the same look if he’d been here.</p>
	<p class="block47">“Gah!” Patrick shoved his sword back into its sheath and pivoted on his heel. </p>
	<p class="block47"><i class="calibre6">Go back! They killed Mallory and Zane. They deserve death.</i></p>
	<p class="block47">“Not by my han—“</p>
	<p class="block48">Then you’ll die with them.</p>
	<p class="block47">The earth rumbled. The ground shook beneath his feet and trickles of dirt showered his head. Screams filled the cave behind him. He glanced back but a boulder smashed into the ramp down into the cavern. He couldn’t reach them.</p>
	<p class="block47">Racing up the tunnel, he careened into walls like a drunkard. Falling rocks smacked his arms and head and blood trickled from broken skin. Seeing light ahead, Patrick made one last push and flew from the cave just as a deep concussion to the air sounded behind him.</p>
	<p class="block47">Then dust, dirt and air whooshed from the cave as it collapsed. He stumbled and fell to his knees. Shocked, he turned and sat, staring at what used to be a cave. No one else made it out.</p>
	<p class="block47">“I would’ve been inside.”</p>
	<p class="block47"><i class="calibre6">Yes. And I would’ve claimed your murderous soul. </i></p>
	<p class="block47">Patrick shuddered as goose bumps covered his flesh. His breath caught as a dark shape separated from him. Empty, bottomless eyes stared at him from a shadowy face just like his own. </p>
	<p class="block47"><i class="calibre6">I would’ve killed you as you murdered them. </i>The shade said. <i class="calibre6">Then I would’ve claimed your body as my own. </i>The shade dissipated like smoke, and the voice was gone. With it went the angry desire for revenge Patrick had been clinging to. </p>
	<p class="block47">“Oh God,” he slumped to lean against a rock. The ground still shuddered beneath him.</p>
	<p class="block47">“What was that?!” The young girl ran from her hiding place to fling her arms around him.</p>
	<p class="block23">Patrick hugged her back. “My own personal demon, I think.” His words stuttered in his throat. He’d almost lost his soul.</p>
