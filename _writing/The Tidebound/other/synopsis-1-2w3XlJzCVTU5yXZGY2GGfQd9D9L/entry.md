Okay, I've revised the character names and tweaked the detailed synopsis with a "distant future Nova Scotia" vibe in mind. I've aimed for names that feel a bit more contemporary/stylized and details that subtly evoke the setting without being overly explicit.

**Revised Elements:**
- **Setting Hints:** Instead of generic "ruins," I'll allude to specific geographical features or cultural remnants that hint at Nova Scotia (e.g., coastal erosion, resilient fishing communities, unique flora/fauna).
- **Character Names:**
  - Elara becomes **"Kaelen"** (a bit more modern, Celtic influence).
  - Samira becomes **"Lennox"** (unisex, slightly rugged).
- **Enclave:** I'll give the Enclave a name that suggests a maritime authority or a corporation that controls coastal resources, like "The Shoreguard" or "Aqualex."

**Revised Detailed Synopsis:**

**Title:** *The Tidebound*

**Logline:** In a resource-scarce future where the coastline of what was once Nova Scotia is drastically altered, a scavenger and a guardian of a hidden beach must forge a connection to protect it from a powerful organization seeking to exploit its unique regenerative properties.

**Chapter 1: The Choice**
- We meet KAELEN, a quick-witted scavenger navigating the treacherous, eroded coastline, salvaging tech and supplies from sunken "old-world" settlements (hinting at submerged coastal towns). She's known for her knowledge of tides and currents.
- Kaelen discovers a secluded cove with a surprisingly vibrant ecosystem, a stark contrast to the ravaged landscape. Here, she encounters LENNOX, a member of a close-knit community called the "Tide Keepers," who have lived in harmony with the cove for generations. Lennox is wary of outsiders and deeply connected to the cove's rhythms and cycles.
- The initial conflict arises from Kaelen's pragmatic need for resources versus Lennox's fierce protection of the cove's delicate balance. Their interactions reveal Kaelen's adaptability and Lennox's deep-rooted connection to the land and sea, hinting at the traditions of the region's indigenous people and early settlers.
- The arrival of a patrol from AQUALEX, a corporation controlling offshore resources and coastal settlements, disrupts their encounter. Aqualex is searching for something specific within the cove, something related to its unusual regenerative properties, raising the stakes and forcing Kaelen and Lennox to consider an alliance.
  - This sets up the clash of values: exploitation vs. preservation, echoing historical tensions around resource extraction in the region.

**Chapter 2: The Trouble**
- Kaelen and Lennox form a tentative partnership, navigating their differing worldviews and the challenges of coexisting. Their relationship grows through shared experiences, with Kaelen learning to appreciate the cove's ecological significance and Lennox recognizing Kaelen's resourcefulness.
- They face obstacles that test their resilience: unpredictable "surge tides" (exaggerated tidal events due to climate change), the constant threat of Aqualex surveillance using advanced drone technology, and the discovery of mutated marine life that poses a danger to the cove. These threats subtly reflect the environmental challenges faced by coastal communities.
- Their attempts to protect the cove involve a series of escalating encounters with Aqualex, revealing the corporation's ruthless tactics and the lengths they'll go to for control. There are hints of internal dissent within Aqualex, suggesting not everyone agrees with their methods.
- The chapter culminates in the discovery that the cove's unique properties are linked to a rare bioluminescent algae bloom, which has a powerful regenerative effect on damaged tissue and the surrounding environment. Aqualex is determined to control this resource, increasing the danger to Kaelen and Lennox and the cove.
  - This introduces a unique sci-fi element grounded in a natural phenomenon, moving away from generic "ancient technology."

**Chapter 3: The Twist**
- The twist shifts the focus from Lennox being a "chosen one" to revealing that the Tide Keepers possess a deep understanding of the bioluminescent algae's life cycle and its connection to the cove's unique geological features (e.g., underwater geothermal vents). This knowledge is passed down through generations in oral tradition and songs.
- Kaelen and Lennox, combining their skills, attempt to use the algae's properties to create a defense against Aqualex, but their efforts have unintended consequences, temporarily disrupting the cove's delicate balance and attracting more attention. This highlights the theme of unintended consequences in ecological manipulation.
- Aqualex launches a major operation, capturing Lennox not as a "key," but as a hostage to force the Tide Keepers to reveal their knowledge of the algae. This creates a moral dilemma for Kaelen: risk further ecological damage to save Lennox, or protect the cove at all costs.
  - This twist emphasizes the value of indigenous knowledge and the ethical complexities of scientific discovery.

**Chapter 4: The Epiphany**
- Kaelen's epiphany is not about a grand solution but about embracing a sustainable approach. She realizes that the cove's survival and the Tide Keepers' way of life are interconnected, and that true preservation requires working in harmony with nature, not dominating it.
- Kaelen infiltrates Aqualex headquarters (perhaps a repurposed offshore platform), not for a violent confrontation, but to negotiate using her knowledge of the tides, currents, and the algae's sensitivity to environmental changes. She also leverages the internal conflicts within Aqualex to find allies.
- The climax involves a tense exchange and a demonstration of the algae's regenerative potential, offering Aqualex a chance for a less destructive path. This leads to a fragile alliance between Kaelen, the Tide Keepers, and a faction within Aqualex, focused on sustainable resource management and ecological restoration.
- The resolution avoids a simplistic "happily ever after." It emphasizes the ongoing struggle to balance human needs with environmental preservation, with Kaelen and Lennox committed to protecting the cove and sharing their knowledge, acknowledging the long-term challenges and the need for continuous adaptation in a changing world. The final image could be them working together to cultivate the algae sustainably, ensuring the cove's future.
  - This ending promotes a message of hope grounded in ecological responsibility and collaboration.

I believe this revised outline provides a more nuanced and evocative story, subtly weaving in elements of a future Nova Scotia while avoiding common clichés.
