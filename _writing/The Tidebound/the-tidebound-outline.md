## Themes

- Environmental preservation vs. corporate exploitation
- Trust and betrayal
- Personal redemption through connection
- Consequences of reckless action
- Sacrifice for the greater good
- Healing from trauma

## Tone

- Cli-fi (climate fiction) with romantic elements
- Action-driven with emotional depth
- Environmental urgency balanced with character intimacy
- Bittersweet but ultimately hopeful

## Writing Notes

- Use sensory details for bioluminescent algae scenes
- Balance action sequences with quiet character moments
- Escalate environmental stakes parallel to romantic tension
- Rexton should be sympathetic villain (believes he's helping humanity)
- Cove as character—its health reflects relationship status
