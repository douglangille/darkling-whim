**2. The Sunken Village of Port Cabot**
- **Description:** Partially submerged ruins of a once-thriving fishing village, now mostly underwater due to sea-level rise. Jagged remnants of buildings and docks are visible at low tide, a haunting reminder of the past. Some structures have been adapted by scavengers and outcasts, built on stilts or floating platforms.
- **Climate/Seasons:** Similar to the cove, but more exposed to the elements. The ruins offer little shelter from storms and surge tides.
- **Nova Scotia Inspiration:** Represents the many coastal communities in Nova Scotia threatened by rising sea levels and coastal erosion. The resilient scavengers echo the resourcefulness of those who have historically relied on the sea for survival.
