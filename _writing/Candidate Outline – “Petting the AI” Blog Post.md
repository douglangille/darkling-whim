## Working Title

Petting the AI: Designing Against Parasocial Chatbots

## Possible Structure

1. **Hook**
   - Personal confession about chat sprawl and the strange comfort of late-night AI chats.
   - Introduce the phrase “petting the AI.”

2. **The Intimacy of the Phone**
   - Phone as always-with-you object; why it encourages emotional use.
   - Brief nod to research on parasociality and AI companions [web:39][web:41][web:44].

3. **How Chat Sprawl Happens**
   - One-offs, half-finished threads, and “talking to the bot about everything.”
   - The guilt of not curating versus the impossibility of doing so.

4. **Architecting a Defense**
   - Present the three-device stack:
     - Gemini (phone/iPad) as self-cleaning, 3-month memory tool [file:49].
     - Perplexity + GitHub as the serious workbench.
     - Claude/Mistral as specialized prose tools.
   - Emphasize auto-delete and content-first entry as key design decisions.

5. **From Willpower to System Design**
   - Argument that sustainable digital hygiene comes from constraints, not discipline.
   - How encoding intent into devices and tools reduces emotional drift.

6. **Practical Checklist**
   - Turn on auto-delete for mobile AI.
   - Remove archival AI tools from the phone.
   - Use share sheets or browser integrations so AI is invoked by content, not by boredom.
   - Keep a Git-backed `!nbox` for keeper outputs.

7. **Closing**
   - Reframe: AI isn’t a pet; it’s a power tool.
   - Invite readers to design their own boundaries rather than waiting to feel “addicted” first.

This outline ties together personal experience, technical architecture, and psychological risk into a single narrative suitable for a Digital Doug post.
