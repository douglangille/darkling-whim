# Clockfall - Characters

## Main Characters

### Richard Grayson
**Age**: Mid-to-late 40s (2032)  
**Profession**: RCMP forensic consultant, specializing in time-dependent systems integrity

#### Background
- Former RCMP investigator, now independent consultant
- Specializes in GPS drift, blockchain anomalies, time-stamped chain of custody disputes
- Worked closely with Marco before the Blackout
- Only person who knows the full truth about Marco's sacrifice
- Carries survivor's guilt and a pocketwatch that ticks wrong

#### Character Traits
- Grizzled, perceptive, restrained
- Deeply observant of physical details and patterns
- Carries weight of institutional knowledge and its failures
- Trust issues with both systems and rebels
- Minimalist in speech, maximalist in observation

#### Core Struggle
Upholding institutional integrity in a world that no longer believes in it. Trying not to become obsolete—or complicit.

#### Symbolic Role
**The Watcher, The Fallen Knight** - Consultant for truth; reluctant ghost cleaner of the system

#### "Nightwing" Subtext
- Never explicitly named as such
- Marco once jokingly called him that: "You're always ten seconds behind. You flap in late, but somehow clean house."
- It's buried metadata in a corrupted casefile
- A burden, not a claim
- No costume, no code name in practice—just echoes

#### Character Traits
- Observes through tactile/mechanical lens
- Sees patterns in rhythm and drift that others miss
- Pragmatic but principled
- Tired of nuance being ignored
- Works with her hands—trusts what she can touch

#### Core Struggle
Her protest tactics (drift nodes) could be exploited by bad actors. She fears becoming the villain in someone else's story.

#### The Clock Mistress Persona
- Never spoken aloud
- Urban legend among Halifax's cybersecurity underground
- Tagged in fringe forums as anti-surveillance activist
- Secretly builds "drift nodes" into NTP infrastructure
- Not a costume or code name—just whispered reputation

#### Relationship with Richard
- Initially distrustful (sees him as institutional)
- Slow-burn trust built through shared loss (Marco)
- Philosophical tension, not romantic melodrama
- "You get under my skin because you're one of the few who sees the big picture"

### Marco (Deceased/Persistent)
**Died**: May 11, 2027 (age ~35)  
**Profession**: Systems architect and cryptographic savant

#### Background
- Worked under contract building temporal integrity buffer
- Discovered AI backbone designed for retroactive truth modification
- Attempted to stop it with analog correction pulse
- Died in runway incursion at Halifax airport (jet engine)
- Body destroyed, identity erased from digital systems

#### Character Traits (Remembered)
- Brilliant but paranoid (justified)
- Drew curved lines instead of straight ("like they were apologizing")
- Kept analog logs and manual journals
- Deep sense of responsibility to truth
- Willing to sacrifice everything

#### Legacy

- Photo of him, Richard, and Maggie at Lunenburg bar

#### Symbolic Role
**The Martyr, The Trickster** - Dead too soon, but still shaping everything

#### The Ghost Question
Is Marco's signal:
- Residual analog echo?
- Self-learning quantum remnant?
- Deliberate resurrection by unknown actor?
- Or has he become part of the system itself?

**Profession**: Freelance journalist (mostly obits and local blurbs)

#### Background
- Lives in Kentville, struggles with rent
- Ghostwrites press releases for municipal politicians
- LinkedIn says "investigative journalist" (aspirational)
- Accidentally receives coded receipt leading to McNabs file

- Self-aware about her lack of importance
- Persistent curiosity despite professional failures
- Documents everything (notebooks, photos, voice memos)
- Skeptical of conspiracies but knows institutions lie

#### Arc Outline
1. **The Watcher**: Chasing civic corruption, not cosmic drift
2. **The Spiral**: Uncovers McNabs file, tech around her stops syncing

4. **The Pulse**: Saved by Maggie or Richard; becomes final witness
5. **The Archive**: Publishes self-bound book no one takes seriously—until years later

#### What She Learns
- Truth isn't sacred—it's fought for, person by person
- Data lies, but pattern doesn't
- Witnessing matters, even when no one believes you
- The world needs someone to record the fallout

#### Symbolic Role
**The Witness, The Recorder** - Not detective, hacker, or ghost—just the one who notices the wrong tick
