# Clockfall

**Genre**: Neo-noir procedural with alt-history speculative realism  
**Setting**: Post-Blackout Near-Future Nova Scotia (2032)  
**Status**: Development - World Building Complete

## Project Overview

Clockfall is a grounded techno-noir story set in Nova Scotia, five years after a global "Time Blackout" event that fractured digital trust and forced society to rebuild with analog systems. The story follows Richard Grayson (RCMP forensic time integrity consultant) and Maggie Kincaid (independent horologist/Clock Mistress) as they investigate temporal anomalies tied to a martyred systems architect named Marco.

## Core Premise

A global Time Blackout struck in 2027—a cascading failure of GPS, network time protocols, and cloud sync systems. In 2032, Richard is pulled into an investigation involving impossible timestamp drift, Marco's ghost in the system, and the possibility that time itself has been weaponized.
