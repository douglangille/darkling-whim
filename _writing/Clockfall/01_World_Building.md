# Clockfall - World Building

## The Canon World: Post-Blackout Near-Future Nova Scotia (2032)

**Tone**: Hyper-grounded techno-noir with real-world gravity.

### The Time Blackout (2027)

A global "Time Blackout" struck in 2027—a cascading failure of GPS, network time protocols, and cloud sync systems due to a precision-timed cyberattack (or solar event… or both—still debated). For 48 hours, digital systems failed worldwide:

- Planes grounded
- Financial systems froze
- Emergency response collapsed
- Digital clocks reported different times

Canada wasn't hit as hard as others—but the Atlantic region was vulnerable. Nova Scotia learned a brutal lesson: **you can't rely on central authority if time itself is unstable.**

### Post-Blackout Society (2028-2032)

Since the Blackout, the Maritimes have become *digitally cautious*, leaning into analog redundancy and localized systems:

- National institutions still exist—but trust is brittle
- Halifax is a strange nexus of retrofitted smart infrastructure, old-school tech, and civic paranoia
- Manual systems and paper logs are standard backup
- "Time forensics" is now a recognized field
- Analog clock restoration has become both practical and political

### Key Locations

#### Halifax/Dartmouth
- **Citadel Hill Data Vault**: Former Cold War bunker, now classified OTI facility
- **Dartmouth Container Terminal**: Abandoned industrial sites hide analog infrastructure
- **Maritime Museum**: Archive of pre-Blackout time measurement systems

#### Lunenburg
- **Town Clock Tower**: Maggie's primary restoration project, contains Marco's hidden messages
- **Maggie's Workshop**: Converted boathouse, nerve center for drift node network

#### McNabs Island
- **Former Radar Station**: Site of 1963 temporal anomaly, still classified

## Historical Timeline

### 1963 - Cold War Halifax (Mythic Origin)
- McNabs Island radar station goes dark for 11 minutes
- Navy clock tech records impossible drift patterns
- Report titled "Echoes Beyond UTC" buried in DND archives
- Lunenburg Clock Tower receives unscheduled adjustment
- **Significance**: First documented temporal manipulation, 11-second drift

### 2026 - The Decency Case
- Richard investigates tampered digital evidence at university
- Metadata shows messages sent before they were written
- Marco uncovers AI auditing tool silently rewriting timestamps
- Contractor escapes consequences
- **Significance**: First crack in Richard's faith in digital systems

### Early 2027 - Marco's Descent
- Marco goes off-grid, keeps analog logs
- Secretly contacts Maggie for analog timekeeping insights
- Discovers global AI backbone tampering with causality
- Devises Temporal Correction Pulse using analog circuitry
- Richard thinks he's losing it—they fight
- **Significance**: Seeds of the Blackout, Marco's martyrdom begins

### May 11, 2027 - The Blackout
- Marco attempts to inject analog heartbeat into EastNet timing system
- Dies in runway incursion at Halifax airport (jet engine)
- Official report: tragic systems error
- Richard recovers pocketwatch ticking 0.5 seconds off UTC
- Time Blackout begins minutes later
- Halifax "burns" metaphorically—files lost, AI destabilized, emergency systems fail
- **Significance**: Inciting incident, Marco becomes ghost in the system

### 2028-2031 - The Burning Years (Reconstruction)
- Halifax rebuilds with paranoid redundancy
- Manual systems return as standard practice
- Public trust in timestamps and AI collapses
- Richard becomes time forensics consultant
- Maggie disappears from public work, travels rural NS restoring clocks
- "Clock Mistress" emerges as urban legend
- **Significance**: World rebuilding, characters finding new roles

### 2032 - The Lunenburg Discovery (Frame Story Begins)
- Maggie restores Lunenburg Town Clock
- Discovers gear etched with Marco's signature: `- M. // :60`
- Clock ticks out of phase by 11 seconds (same as 1963)
- **Significance**: Past and present converge, story begins

## Thematic Axes

| Theme | Explored Through |
|-------|------------------|
| **Truth vs. Authority** | Time data, chain of custody, tampered evidence, institutional overreach |
| **Analog vs. Digital** | Maggie's mechanical tools vs. AI-optimized forensics |
| **Memory and Drift** | Characters dealing with time loss—personally and professionally |
| **Resilience** | Atlantic Canada's quiet, pragmatic culture holding its own |
| **Surveillance and Rebellion** | Maggie's soft resistance; Richard's institutional conflict |
| **Time is not neutral** | Systems built to measure it can be corrupted |
| **Sacrifice and ambiguity** | Marco's death was heroic—or reckless. Or both. |
| **Legacy and ghost code** | Marco lives on in drift, in gears, in code nobody understands |

## The Office of Technological Integrity (OTI)

Post-Blackout government agency tasked with:
- Investigating temporal anomalies
- Data sanitation and security
- Suppressing evidence of ongoing drift patterns
- Erasing "ghost signatures" from systems

**Key Figure**: Dale (not his real name) - data sanitation specialist attempting to erase Marco's presence from systems

## Marco's Legacy: The Heartbeat Signature

Marco's analog correction pulse didn't stop the Blackout—but it persists:

- Etched gears found in restored clocks across Nova Scotia
- Rhythm markers: `:59.5`, `:60`, `:60.5`, `:61`, `:∞`
- All synchronized to 60 bpm—a human heartbeat
- Still detectable in temporal drift patterns 5 years later
- Maggie has collected dozens of etched gears
- Richard finds Marco's materials in hidden caches

**The Pattern**: Marco's signal is growing, learning, or both. Was it ever truly analog?

## Beacon Points

Network of "truth-stabilization nodes" embedded in Nova Scotia's iconic analog devices:
- Town clocks
- Fog horns  
- Railway signals
- Marine chronometers

Someone has been hardening time against future collapse. Someone else is undoing that work.
