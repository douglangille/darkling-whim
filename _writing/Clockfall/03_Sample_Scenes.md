# Clockfall - Sample Scenes

Three complete scenes demonstrating the tone, style, and character voice of the project.

---

## Scene 1: Tempo Drop
**POV**: Richard Grayson (Deep POV, past tense)  
**Location**: Abandoned maintenance substation, Dartmouth  
**Tone**: Gritty, minimalist, Tarantino-style dialogue

---

Richard's boot broke through the floor panel with a sound like dry bone snapping.  
He grunted, shifted his weight. The plywood groaned under him, but held.

**_Don't stall. Just look._**

He aimed his flashlight through the gap. Dust motes danced in the beam. Behind the panel, someone had bolted a lead-lined lockbox to the cement. Old-school fireproof. Blackened around the edges.

**_Too analog to be bait. Too deliberate not to be something._**

He dropped to one knee, peeled open the loose plywood edge with a gloved hand. A single roach skittered out.

The lockbox had no latch—just a screw top, fused with time and weather. He hooked it with the edge of his multi-tool and twisted.  
It gave.

Inside:  
- One brass metronome, ticking.  
- One 3.5" floppy disk with a label scrawled in faded Sharpie:  
  > `~heart.bpm`  
- And a photo.

Of him.  
Of Marco.  
And of Maggie.

A bar in Lunenburg, two years before the world fell sideways. Marco's eyes were glassy, mouth half open. Maggie had a pint raised mid-cheers.  
Richard was looking away, distracted by something outside frame.

**_I remember this night. I don't remember the picture being taken._**

The metronome clicked.

Tick.  
Tick.  
Tick.  
Sixty beats per minute. Off by a half-step—subtle, like a limp in rhythm.

He stared at it.

Then he heard movement.

A shuffle.  
Metal dragging against concrete behind him.

He didn't speak. Just turned and stood.  
A silhouette blinked into form—hooded, lean, holding a length of pipe. Maybe sixteen. Twitchy hands. Stance too loose to be trained, too wired to be unarmed.

"Give me the bag," the kid said.

Richard stepped forward instead.

"No," he said.

The kid moved first—wrong angle, too fast.

Richard pivoted.  
Let the pipe swing past.  
Used the momentum to slam his shoulder into the kid's sternum.

They both hit the floor.  
Dust exploded.  
The flashlight skittered across concrete.

Richard pinned the kid with a knee, twisted the pipe free, dropped it.

The kid spat blood. Teeth red.

"I didn't know it was *you*," he wheezed.

"You don't know shit."

"I was just—just supposed to check. Just see if someone came. That's all."

"Who told you I'd come?"

The kid coughed. Said nothing.

Richard stood. Wiped dust from his coat. Retrieved the photo, the disk, the metronome.

The kid stayed on the ground, eyes wild.  

"You think he's still alive," the kid said suddenly. "That's why you're looking."

Richard paused.

Then he turned, walked out into the cold salt air.

The metronome still ticked.  
Softer now, in his coat pocket.  
Like a distant second heart.

## Scene 2: Half Turn Back
**POV**: Maggie Kincaid (Deep POV, past tense)  
**Location**: Lunenburg Clock Tower maintenance crawlspace  
**Tone**: Tactile observation, mechanical focus, quiet intensity

---

Maggie wedged the torch between two joists, beam angled down.  
It lit the gearhouse in slanted gold. Everything cast a long shadow.  
Metal teeth. Brass veins. Pulled tight in time.

*Too clean.*  
Someone's been here.

She lowered herself, boots thudding soft on old planks. The wood gave the way wood gives when it's old but proud. The Tower still had its bones.

She unwrapped the oiled cloth from her kit. Same twelve tools she'd used since she was nineteen. Different wraps. Same steel.  
Still knew how to listen.

Clock hands ticked above.  
Not precise. Not off either. The sound was telling a story. A patient one.

She brushed aside a curtain of cobwebs and ducked under the mainspring housing.

*Right there.*  
Small gear. Not part of the original array.

She plucked it gently.

Weight was wrong. Too light.

Etched surface.  
Not stamped.  
Hand-done.

Etched numbers:  
> `:60`  
Then a mark.  
Not a letter.  
A line.  
And a circle.

*Marco.*

No name. Just his rhythm.  
She knew it. Felt it in her fingertips. He never drew straight lines. Always bowed them just a touch, like they were apologizing.

She leaned against the wall and sat, legs folded under. Let her eyes adjust. Let the smell of oil and time settle in her lungs.

*He did it.*  
Or part of it.  
This was a message.  
A sync check.  
A breadcrumb.

She slid the gear into her coat pocket.

Then she heard it.

The tick changed.

Just a hair. Not late, not early—*tired*.

She stood.  
Traced the wiring again.  
Not hers.

Old wire, rerouted.  
Tied off with red cloth.  
**Not** building standard.

She followed it to a cavity in the support beam. Pried it open with the back end of her screwdriver.

Small speaker.  
Battery long dead.

Behind it, taped:  
An envelope. Wax seal, broken.  
Inside: A single Polaroid. Faded.

Marco. Sitting on the bell housing. Grinning.  
Holding a metronome.  
Her metronome.  
Back when it still lived in her shop.

Scrawled in pen beneath:
> `Still ticking.`

She exhaled once. Not heavy. Just deep.  

*He knew.*  
He knew she'd come back.

Behind her, the wind picked up. Rain hit the panes like knuckles.

Time didn't stop.

But it did *remember.*

## Scene 3: Null Echo
**POV**: Dale (Third person limited, present tense)  
**Location**: OTI data vault beneath Citadel Hill  
**Tone**: Clinical paranoia, institutional dread

---

The man went by **Dale**, though that wasn't his name.

Dale had a clearance level that didn't exist in documentation.  
He had a retinal implant with no serial number.  
And he had a specific job:

> Find drift.  
> Trace rhythm anomalies.  
> Erase the ghost.

He sat alone in the vault, hunched over a workstation built like a missile console. Three screens. Low refresh rates by design.  
No AI support. No smart anything.

*Smart machines get clever. Clever gets contaminated.*

He clicked through waveform data. Marco's signature—if you could call it that—wasn't static. It wasn't even signal. It was *variance*. Like a breath taken just slightly out of sync with the room. A silence between beats that *shouldn't* be there.

He zoomed in on the dataset flagged earlier that morning by an anomaly sweep near Yarmouth.

*Four milliseconds slow. Then eight. Then back to standard.*

The system didn't know what to make of it.  
The system didn't remember Marco.

Dale did.

He remembered the firewall that wouldn't collapse. The node that refused to resync. The analog gear in Lunenburg that wouldn't stop ticking even after power was cut.

He knew Marco wasn't alive. That wasn't the problem.

The problem was that **Marco was persistent**.

A voice—compressed, synthetic—broke the silence through a wall intercom.

> "Unit-6 requesting your status on cleanup window six-alpha."

Dale replied without looking up.

"Still in progress."

> "You've exceeded retention limits."

He stood, pulled a datablade from the primary port.  
Wiped it on his sleeve like it mattered.

"I'll bring it up."

He didn't.  
Instead, he crossed to the vault's back wall and opened a narrow cabinet.

Inside: a rotary phone.

Red.

He picked it up.  
No ring. No tone.  
Just silence.

After five seconds, he spoke.

"Heartbeat rhythm is still active."

Pause.  
Another breath.  
"You want me to bury it, I need the original seed. The gear. The ∞ mark."

Another pause.

Then, a barely audible click.  
Line dead.

Dale replaced the phone. Locked the cabinet.

He walked back to the console.  
Wiped the last twenty minutes of work. Overwrote the logs manually.

No drift.  
No echo.  
Nothing to trace.

But in the corner of the middle monitor, a timestamp flickered.

Only once.  
Then back.

It was off by 11 seconds.  
The same 11 logged at McNabs in 1963.

## Writing Style Notes

### Richard's POV
- Internal thoughts italicized, pre-sentence, sparse
- Observes physical details, patterns, mechanics
- Minimal dialogue, loaded when spoken
- Action-driven, no melodrama
- Past tense, deep third person

### Maggie's POV  
- Tactile/mechanical observations prioritized
- Sees through tools and materials
- Rhythm and pattern recognition
- Less dialogue, more sensation
- Past tense, deep third person

### Dale's POV
- Clinical, institutional language
- Present tense for immediacy and paranoia
- System-focused observations
- Compressed dialogue via intercom/phone
- Third person limited

### Universal Style Guidelines
- **No purple prose** - description is functional and occasional
- **Minimalist dialogue** - Tarantino-sharp, loaded with subtext
- **Show, don't tell** - action drives scene
- **Gritty realism** - violence is ugly and brief
- **Sensory details** - copper, salt air, concrete, brass, oil
