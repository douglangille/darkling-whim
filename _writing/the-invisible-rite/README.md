**Genre:** Political thriller / Conspiracy fiction / Architectural mystery  
**Target Length:** ~100,000 words / 27 chapters (~80 scenes)  
**Status:** Development / Scene brief phase  
**Authorship Model:** Human-guided, AI-assisted collaborative writing

## Themes

- Power as architecture: when belief is built into stone, who owns it?
- Imperfection as freedom; perfection as tyranny
- Language, ritual, and bureaucracy as forms of magic
- The moral cost of knowledge: contain it, expose it, or let it die
- Can a republic survive by remaining forever unfinished?

## Creative Philosophy

> "The Founders built a republic of reason. Their heirs rebuilt it into a temple of faith."

This story explores conspiracy not as paranoia but as pattern—the human need to encode meaning into physical space, and what happens when those patterns try to complete themselves.

## Process Notes

This project is being developed as a transparent experiment in AI-human co-authorship:
- Story logic, themes, and character arcs designed by human author
- Structural synthesis and scene scaffolding assisted by AI
- Final prose, pacing, and editorial choices remain human-controlled

The meta-process will be documented for potential publication alongside or after the novel itself.
