## Scene Briefs

**Purpose:** Establish mythic history, moral warning, and the humming architecture that underpins everything.

## Scene 1 — Ritual of Consecration (S)

**Location:** Mellon Auditorium, 1935  
**POV:** Omniscient / Ritual Chorus  
**Goal:** Perform the dedication of the Mellon Auditorium according to Masonic rites

**Obstacle:** Tension between pageant and true ritual; the architects fear federal oversight will trivialize the ceremony

**Conflict/Action:** The Grand Master insists the geometry must remain imperfect; younger members push for precision

**Climax/Turn:** The apprentice aligns the final corner exactly despite the warning. The harmonic hum begins.

**Outcome:** Ritual "succeeds" outwardly, but an unseen vibration lingers

**Tone/Mood:** Gilded light, solemn choir, marble as resonant instrument

**Thematic Hook:** Humanity's obsession with perfect order invites imbalance

## Sequel 1 — Aftermath and Warning (Q)

**Emotional Reaction:** Apprentice panics, senses the building breathe; older Masons pretend not to hear

**Reflection:** He wonders if they've built a temple to faith or to fear

**Decision:** He seals the charter but leaves one sigil line faintly incomplete, defying his superiors

**Set-up:** That missing stroke becomes the future vault's weak point—and the reason the hum persists

**Transition:** Fade to silence, machinery noise of 2025 demolition blending with remembered chants

## Writing Notes

- Voice: Near-scriptural cadence, stylized
- Sensory focus: Sound (choir, gavel, hum), light (candles, marble reflection), texture (cold stone)
- Keep prologue tight: 1000–1500 words
- Establish pattern: perfection attempted → warning ignored → consequence echoes forward
