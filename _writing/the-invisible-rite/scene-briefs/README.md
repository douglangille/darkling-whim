# Scene Briefs
## The Invisible Rite

---

This directory contains expanded **scene/sequel breakdowns** for each chapter, designed as writing prompts for drafting.

Each chapter sequence is broken into 2–3 scenes following the **Scene → Sequel** model:

- **Scene (S):** Goal → Obstacle → Conflict → Climax/Turn → Outcome
- **Sequel (Q):** Emotional Reaction → Reflection → Decision → Transition
