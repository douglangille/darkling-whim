## Scene 1 — Discovery at the Demolition Site (S)

**Location:** White House East Wing demolition site  
**POV:** Cal Mercer  
**Goal:** Authenticate the unearthed copper vault; wants to treat it as routine archaeology

**Obstacle:** Workers are superstitious; site unstable, press sniffing around

**Conflict/Action:** He orders the vault photographed and begins cursory inspection; the hum distorts his instruments

**Climax/Turn:** Touching the surface, he feels vibration and hears faint tones like overlapping choirs

**Outcome:** Pretends nothing happened, masks confusion with professionalism

**Tone/Mood:** Harsh work lights, dust motes, the smell of hot metal

**Thematic Hook:** The rational mind's first encounter with irrational design

## Sequel 1 — Analytical Dismissal (Q)

**Emotional Reaction:** Annoyance at his own imagination

**Reflection:** Reviews readings; decides the resonance must be mechanical feedback

**Decision:** File preliminary report, keep one rubbing for himself

**Transition:** At the trailer office, the humming stops when he leaves—then resumes as the generator cuts power

## Scene 2 — Private Curiosity (S)

**Location:** Mercer's apartment  
**POV:** Cal Mercer  
**Goal:** Examine the rubbing alone

**Obstacle:** Fatigue, skepticism, and his father's old notebooks distracting him

**Conflict/Action:** He matches part of the sigil to a forgotten annotation in his father's files

**Climax/Turn:** The correlation is too precise to dismiss as coincidence

**Outcome:** Decides to visit the Archives first thing in the morning

**Tone/Mood:** Dim desk lamp, hum barely audible through city noise

**Thematic Hook:** Obsession born from curiosity; the call of the pattern

---

## Sequel 2 — Quiet Compulsion (Q)

**Emotional Reaction:** Restless fascination replacing reason

**Reflection:** Tells himself he's chasing closure about his father, not mystery

**Decision:** Commit fully to investigation, unofficially

**Exit Beat:** He turns off the light; the vault hum echoes faintly in his skull

## Writing Notes

- Establish Mercer's voice: methodical, slightly detached, dry humor
- Synesthesia element: describe how he "hears" the geometry
- Father's ghost present but subtle—margin notes, familiar handwriting
- Keep professional mask intact until private scene
