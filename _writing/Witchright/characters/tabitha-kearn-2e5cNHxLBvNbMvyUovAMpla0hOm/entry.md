Tabitha Kearn: A troubled classmate of Sam's who harbors a deep jealousy and resentment towards her, and becomes possessed by a powerful demonic entity known as the Darkling.

Tabitha is a loner who often feels isolated and unseen, leading her to be envious and jealous of others. She is intelligent, however, and uses her mind to overcome her difficulties. Her Myers-Briggs personality type is INTP, or the "Logician." She is a highly analytical and creative person who is always looking for new and interesting ways to solve problems. Her enneagram type is 4, or the "Individualist." She is a unique and special individual who is always striving to stand out from the crowd.



Tabitha's speech is marked by a sardonic, mocking edge, dripping with false sweetness and thinly veiled hostility.

She often uses rhetorical questions and condescending remarks to taunt the other characters, like calling Sam "Sammy" and suggesting she's "playing with fire."

Tabitha's language reflects her resentment and desire for power, as well as the corrupting influence of the Darkling talisman she possesses.
