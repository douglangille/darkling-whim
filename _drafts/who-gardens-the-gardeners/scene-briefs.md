# Scene Briefs: Who Gardens the Gardeners?

**Project**: Expansion to Novelette  
**Total Scenes**: 20 (5 preserved/expanded, 15 new)  
**Target Word Count**: 8,500 words  
**Created**: December 24, 2025

---

## ACT 1: TRANSFORMATION BEGINS

### Scene 1: The Dare (PRESERVED)

**Type**: Scene  
**POV Character**: David (first-person)  
**Setting**: Hilltop under lightning-split oak tree, blistering summer day  
**Word Count Target**: 250 words

**Status**: PRESERVE ORIGINAL VERBATIM

**Content**: Opening through "It was a good afternoon."  
**Tree Verse**: "Hello, said Tree. I'm in you and you're in me."

**Original Structure**:
- **Goal**: Accept Betsy's dare to swallow acorn (for payoff of seeing her shirt lifted)
- **Conflict**: Minor (heat, cannabis haze, unripe acorn)
- **Disaster**: Acorn slips into stomach "like it wanted to be there" - seeds transformation

**Voice Anchor**: This is the baseline. David's casual, physical, slightly crude narration. Sets tone for entire story.

**Drafting Approach**: N/A - Already written  
**Integration Notes**: Stands as-is. Scene 2 follows immediately (night, same day).

---

### Scene 2: The Night Terror (MINOR EXPANSION)

**Type**: Sequel  
**POV Character**: David (first-person)  
**Setting**: David and Betsy's bedroom, middle of the night  
**Word Count Target**: 200 words (was 150)

**Status**: PRESERVE CORE, MINOR ADDITIONS

**Original Structure (Sequel)**:
- **Reaction**: Wakes screaming with pain, swollen stomach, worse dream
- **Dilemma**: Implied - something's very wrong, medical emergency obvious
- **Decision**: Go to hospital (Betsy decides for him)

**Additions Needed**:
1. Expand the dream: What did David see? Tree's presence? Roots growing? Keep vague but visceral.
2. End with them rushing to car (transition to Scene 3)

**Tree Verse**: "Seed and Sprout, there is no doubt."

**Voice**: David's fear breaking through casual tone. Pain genuine. Still his voice but cracking.

**Drafting Approach**: [X] Human First Draft (minimal expansion to existing text)  
**Leads to**: Scene 3 (ER arrival)  
**Comes from**: Scene 1 (the dare, hours earlier)

**Integration Notes**: Keep original dialogue and beats. Add 2-3 sentences on dream content. Add 1-2 sentences of them getting to car. Preserve "Dreamed something. Inside. Inside me. Alive." exactly.

### Scene 3: Emergency Room

**Type**: Scene  
**POV Character**: Betsy (close third)  
**Setting**: Regional hospital ER, pre-dawn / early morning  
**Word Count Target**: 600 words

---

#### Structure (Scene)

**Goal**: 
Betsy needs the ER staff to take David's condition seriously and help him immediately. She wants answers and she wants him not to be in pain.

**Conflict**: 
- ER staff initially dismissive ("What did he swallow? When? Just an acorn?")
- Triage nurse sees the swelling, priority shifts but confusion remains
- David's vitals are wrong (temperature elevated, heart rate strange)
- Doctor examines him, can't explain what's happening
- David's terror escalating, Betsy helpless to comfort him
- Medical system protocols separate them ("You'll have to wait out here, miss")
- Her questions get non-answers ("We're running tests")

**Disaster**: 
David is taken away on gurney to isolation. Betsy is forced to waiting room, separated from him. A specialist (Dr. Evans) is being called in. She's alone with no information, dawn coming, and David is somewhere she can't reach him.

---

**Leads to**: Scene 4 (Evans examining David) and Scene 5 (Betsy sent home)  
**Comes from**: Scene 2 (rushing to hospital)

---

#### Drafting Information

**Drafting Approach**: [X] AI First Draft (author will refine Betsy's voice)

**Status**: [ ] Brief Only  [ ] Drafted  [ ] Scene-Level Review Complete  [ ] Revised  [ ] Final

**Notes**: 
- First Betsy POV - establish her voice: practical, trying to stay calm, counting things
- Show her love for David through action and worry
- ER details: fluorescent lights, plastic chairs, smell of disinfectant, clock ticking
- Medical staff get brief personality (not named except triage nurse maybe?)
- David's pain and fear visible but we're outside his head now
- End on her isolation - waiting room, alone, can't help
- This is where their separation begins (physical and POV)

---

### Scene 4: Dr. Evans' First Encounter

**Type**: Scene  
**POV Character**: Dr. Evans (clinical observation becoming personal)  
**Setting**: Hospital isolation room, examination area, early morning  
**Word Count Target**: 500 words

---

#### Structure (Scene)

**Goal**: 
Dr. Evans needs to diagnose David's condition and determine appropriate treatment protocol. He's a specialist (infectious disease? Unusual pathology?) called in for a "weird case." He wants to understand what he's looking at.

**Conflict**: 
- Nothing fits known biology (plant cells in human tissue? Cellular fusion?)
- Initial hypotheses fail (parasitic? Fungal? Tumor? None match)
- Growth is accelerating while he watches
- Patient is semi-conscious, non-responsive to questions
- Standard tests yield impossible results
- His expertise is useless here - he's encountering something unprecedented
- Institutional pressure to provide answers/treatment plan when he has none

**Disaster**: 
Evans realizes this is beyond his understanding and possibly beyond medical science. He makes the decision to isolate David completely and document everything rather than attempt treatment he doesn't understand. This is either "make my career" or "end it" - and he doesn't know which. He's now committed to observing rather than curing.

---

**Leads to**: Scene 5 (concurrent - Betsy sent home), then Scene 6 (David wakes, Week 1)  
**Comes from**: Scene 3 (ER admission, Evans called)

---

#### Drafting Information

**Drafting Approach**: [X] AI First Draft (author will refine clinical voice)

**Status**: [ ] Brief Only  [ ] Drafted  [ ] Scene-Level Review Complete  [ ] Revised  [ ] Final

**Notes**: 
- Establish Evans' voice: clinical, precise, rational scientist
- But underneath: curiosity, unease, ambition
- Show him looking at cellular samples, taking notes, observing David
- First clinical note embedded here (professional tone)
- Setting: sterile isolation room, monitoring equipment, specimens
- Evans is in control here but the control is illusory
- Hint at his eventual breakdown: "I'll document everything"
- End with him watching David sleep, seeing growth happen in real-time
- This is the moment science fails

---

### Scene 5: Betsy Goes Home

**Type**: Sequel  
**POV Character**: Betsy (close third)  
**Setting**: Betsy and David's apartment, late morning / early afternoon  
**Word Count Target**: 250 words

---

#### Structure (Sequel)

**Reaction**: 
Betsy has been sent home from the hospital ("Come back tomorrow, we'll know more"). She's exhausted, terrified, helpless. Their empty apartment is full of David's presence - his coffee mug, his jacket, his smell. She can't eat. Can't think straight. She has a stomach ache that she dismisses as stress.

**Dilemma**: 
What can she do? 
- Wait helplessly while David suffers in isolation?
- Demand to stay at hospital (they won't let her)?
- Try to function normally (impossible)?
- Call his family, her family (and say what?)?

All options feel wrong. She's powerless.

**Decision**: 
She'll try to sleep, calm down, count things to regulate her anxiety. Tomorrow she'll go back and demand answers. For now: survive until tomorrow. Count to sleep. (This decision is surrender to waiting, to powerlessness - a small disaster in itself.)

---

**Leads to**: Scene 6 (Week 1 - David wakes), Scene 7 (Evans' Day 3 log), Scene 8 (Betsy visiting)  
**Comes from**: Scene 3 (separated from David at hospital)

---

#### Drafting Information

**Drafting Approach**: [X] AI First Draft (author will refine emotional beats)

**Status**: [ ] Brief Only  [ ] Drafted  [ ] Scene-Level Review Complete  [ ] Revised  [ ] Final

**Notes**: 
- Establish Betsy's counting compulsion clearly
- Show her love through small details (his things in apartment)
- First subtle symptom: stomach ache she rationalizes away
- Tree Verse placement: "Bark and Branch, look within"
- Keep this short - it's a breathing moment between hospital scenes
- End with her in their bed, counting, falling into uneasy sleep
- Foreshadow her transformation without her knowing
- Setting: small apartment, their shared domestic life, now broken

## Act 1 Scene Chain Validation

**Scene 1** (Scene): Goal (take dare) → Disaster (acorn in stomach)  
↓  
**Scene 2** (Sequel): Reaction (pain, terror) → Decision (go to hospital)  
↓  
**Scene 3** (Scene): Goal (get David help) → Disaster (David taken away, Betsy separated)  
↓  
**Scene 4** (Scene - concurrent): Goal (diagnose David) → Disaster (can't diagnose, chooses observation over treatment)  
↓  
**Scene 5** (Sequel): Reaction (exhausted, helpless, first symptom) → Decision (wait, count, sleep, return tomorrow)

**Chain Status**: ✅ Validated
- Scene 1 Disaster leads to Scene 2 Reaction
- Scene 2 Decision leads to Scene 3 Goal
- Scene 3 Disaster leads to Scene 5 Reaction
- Scene 4 runs parallel (Evans POV) but ends in his own disaster
- Scene 5 Decision sets up Act 2 (her returning to hospital, symptoms developing)

**Pacing**: Alternates Scene/Sequel appropriately. Scene 4 adds parallel tension. Act 1 ends on Sequel (breathing room before Act 2 intensity).

## Authorship Decisions

**Human First Draft**:
- Scene 2 (minor expansion to existing text)

**AI First Draft** (author will edit for voice/authenticity):
- Scene 3 (Betsy POV)
- Scene 4 (Evans POV)
- Scene 5 (Betsy POV)

**Rationale**: 
- Scene 2 is minimal work on existing prose - human touch preserves original voice
- Scenes 3-5 are substantial new material - AI scaffold, author voice refinement
- This distributes work efficiently while maintaining voice control

---

**Next Steps**: 
1. Author approval of Act 1 scene briefs
2. Create scene-tracker.md
3. Begin drafting Act 1 scenes in sequence
4. Author review after Act 1 complete before proceeding to Act 2 briefs

---

**Notes**: Act 2 and Act 3 scene briefs will be created after Act 1 drafting is complete and approved. This allows for any adjustments based on how Act 1 voice/pacing develops.
