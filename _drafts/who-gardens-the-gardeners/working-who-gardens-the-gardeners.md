## ACT 1: TRANSFORMATION BEGINS

### Scene 1: The Dare

> Hello, said Tree. I'm in you and you're in me.  
> Hello, said Tree. Soon we'll be a family.

It started as a joke, really. Betsy dared me.

"Swallow that acorn and I'll lift up my shirt. "Do it, David."

It was a blistering hot summer day. The cicadas were screaming. We hung out under the big oak at the top of the hill. It was shady. We figured we'd pass the time with a few special gummies. Maybe screw around a bit. My stupid idea. Blame it on the heat.

I smirked at her giggling face and rolled the greenish acorn in my hands. It was too early. An unfinished seed.

"Do it," she teased and put her hands on the hem of her tank. It was soaked with sweat and her nipples were encouraging.

I walked closer to the trunk, split by a recent lightening strike and looked at her. I nodded my chin to her in a 'you promised' gesture.

"Down the hatch," I said and plopped the acorn in my mouth and swallowed it. It was small and slipped into my stomach like it wanted to be there.

"That'll hurt on the way out," she said and burst into a cannabis-fueled giggle-fit.

"Probably," I said and approached her, greedily helping her out of her top.

It was a good afternoon.

### Scene 2: The Night Terror

> Seed and Sprout, there is no doubt.  
> No need to cry. No need to pout.

I woke in the middle of the night, screaming with both pain and fright. My gut was killing me, swollen and angry. It felt like the slightest touch would rupture it. But the dream was worse.

In the dream, I was underground. Not buried—rooted. Green tendrils pushed through my skin from the inside, curling into soil that tasted like spring and smelled like rot. Something ancient whispered without words: *Welcome home.* I tried to run but my legs were wood, my feet spreading into the earth like fingers grasping.

Betsy turned on the lamp. "You okay?" she asked stupidly as clearly I was not.

I looked at her and she was coming fully awake and worry washed her face. We'd been living together for a few months. It was comfortable and felt right. I couldn't speak. Just shivered deeply as the open window of night cooled my damp skin.

She saw my stomach. "That ain't right, David," Miss Obvious commented. "You gotta go to the hospital."

I tried to belch to relieve the pressure. Nothing would help. I could only speak in gasps.

"Dreamed something. Inside. Inside me. Alive."

As if on cue, I felt a twitch in my abdomen.

Betsy was already pulling on jeans, grabbing her keys. "Come on," she said, voice tight. "We're going. Now."

I stumbled after her toward the car, one hand pressed against my swollen belly, the other reaching for her in the dark.

### Scene 3: Emergency Room

Betsy counted the fluorescent lights in the ER ceiling. Fourteen. Then the plastic chairs bolted to the floor in the waiting area. Thirty-two. The clock on the wall ticked past 4 a.m., each second a small eternity while David moaned beside her, doubled over and clutching his stomach.

The intake nurse barely looked up at first. "What's the emergency?"

"My boyfriend," Betsy said, forcing calm into her voice. "He's in a lot of pain. His stomach—something's wrong."

"When did symptoms start?"

"Few hours ago. He woke up screaming."

The nurse clicked her pen. "Any known allergies? Medications? What did he eat today?"

Betsy's mouth went dry. "An acorn," she said. "This afternoon. As a joke."

The nurse's eyebrows rose. She leaned forward to look at David, who'd gone pale and sweaty under the harsh lights. "Sir, can you stand for me?"

David tried. His shirt rode up and Betsy heard the nurse's sharp intake of breath. His abdomen was distended, tight as a drum, skin stretched and faintly mottled with green undertones that hadn't been there an hour ago.

"I need a doctor," the nurse said into her phone, calm professional mask sliding into place. "Now."

Things moved fast after that. A wheelchair appeared. David was whisked through double doors into an examination room that smelled like antiseptic and fear. Betsy tried to follow but a hand on her shoulder stopped her.

"You'll need to wait out here, miss."

"But he's—"

"We'll take good care of him. Someone will update you soon."

Through the narrowing gap in the doors, Betsy saw a young doctor—Patel, his name tag read—pulling on gloves and leaning over David. She counted his questions. Five of them, rapid-fire. David's answers were gasps, barely words.

"Temperature's 39.2," a nurse called out. "Heart rate 118 and climbing."

"What's his abdomen feel like?" Dr. Patel asked.

"Rigid. There's—Christ, there's something moving under the skin."

The doors swung shut.

Betsy stood frozen in the hallway, counting the tiles beneath her feet. Forty-seven from the doors to the waiting room. Forty-seven steps between her and David. She walked them backwards, then forward again, trying to slow her breathing.

The waiting room was nearly empty. A man with a bloodied towel wrapped around his hand. An elderly woman coughing into a tissue. The clock ticked. She counted the ticks. Lost count at two hundred and something. Started over.

Dawn crept through the windows, gray and cold.

A different doctor emerged an hour later. Older, steel-rimmed glasses, white coat crisp despite the early hour. He scanned the room and his eyes found her.

"Are you with David Henderson?"

Betsy stood. "Yes. Is he—"

"I'm Dr. Evans. I'm a specialist. Your boyfriend's condition is... unusual. We're running tests, but I need to ask you some questions."

"Can I see him?"

"Not right now. He's being moved to isolation as a precaution."

"Isolation? Is it contagious?"

"We don't know what it is yet." Evans' face was carefully neutral. "You said he swallowed an acorn?"

"Yesterday afternoon. Under the big oak on Vinegar Hill. The one that got hit by lightning."

Something flickered in Evans' expression. "Did you touch the tree?"

The question was so strange that Betsy almost laughed. "Yeah. We both did. Why?"

"And how are you feeling? Any stomach pain? Joint aches? Unusual dreams?"

Betsy's hand moved unconsciously to her belly. There was an ache there, dull and persistent, but she'd assumed it was stress. Hadn't she?

"I'm fine," she lied.

Evans didn't look convinced. "I'd like to examine you as well. Just to be safe."

"I want to see David first."

"That's not possible right now."

Betsy's voice cracked. "He's scared. He needs me."

"What he needs," Evans said quietly, "is for us to understand what's happening to him. And I can't do that if you won't cooperate."

They stared at each other. Finally, Betsy nodded.

"Good," Evans said. "Come with me."

As she followed him down the hallway, Betsy counted her steps. Sixty-three. Sixty-three steps away from David, being taken somewhere she couldn't follow.

She'd never felt so alone.

### Scene 4: Dr. Evans' First Encounter

Dr. Marcus Evans had seen unusual cases before. Parasitic infections that defied conventional treatment. Fungal growths in impossible locations. Once, a patient who'd aspirated a seed that sprouted in their lung tissue—medical curiosity, case study material, ultimately resolved with surgery.

This was different.

He stood at the observation window of isolation room three, watching David Henderson sleep under sedation. The young man's abdomen rose and fell in shallow breaths, the skin stretched taut and discolored. But it was the subtle movement beneath the surface that held Evans transfixed.

Cellular growth. Visible. Happening in real-time.

He pulled up the preliminary lab results on his tablet. Flicked through images from the ultrasound, the CT scan, the blood panel. Nothing made sense. The acorn—if it had been an acorn—was no longer discrete. Instead, there was a mass of tissue that looked neither wholly plant nor wholly animal. The cellular structure showed characteristics of both kingdoms, chromosomes tangled in configurations that shouldn't exist.

Hybridization at the molecular level.

Impossible.

Evans opened a new file and began typing:

**PATIENT**: Henderson, David. Age 24. Admitted 04:47 following acute abdominal distension and pain.

**PRESENTING COMPLAINT**: Patient reports swallowing unripe acorn approximately 18 hours prior to admission. Initial symptoms began during sleep—pain, swelling, fever.

**PRELIMINARY FINDINGS**: Abdominal mass of unknown origin. Imaging reveals dense, fibrous growth emanating from gastric region and spreading through soft tissue. Growth rate unprecedented—estimated 2-3 cm expansion in six hours of observation.

**CELLULAR ANALYSIS**: Samples show chimeric tissue combining plant and animal cellular structures. Chloroplasts present in what appear to be modified human cells. Cell walls forming where none should exist. DNA sequencing pending but preliminary results suggest genetic merger rather than infection or parasitism.

**WORKING HYPOTHESIS**: Unknown. No comparable cases in literature. Recommend continued isolation and observation.

Evans stopped typing and removed his glasses, rubbing the bridge of his nose. In his fifteen years of infectious disease research, he'd never written "unknown" in a working hypothesis. There were always patterns, precedents, frameworks to build upon.

Not here.

He suited up—gown, gloves, face shield—and entered the isolation room. David stirred but didn't wake. Evans moved closer, pulling back the hospital gown to examine the affected area.

The skin had taken on a texture like bark. Rough, layered, gray-green in color. When Evans pressed gently with a gloved finger, it didn't give like human flesh. It resisted. Rigid. Organic armor forming from the inside out.

He scraped a sample from the outermost layer. The tissue flaked away easily, brittle and dry. Beneath it, fresher growth—pliable, almost moist. When he tried to section it with a scalpel for biopsy, David's eyes flew open and he screamed, a sound that sent every monitoring alarm into cascade.

Evans stepped back, hands raised. "It's okay. I'm sorry. I won't—"

But David wasn't looking at him. David's eyes were fixed on the ceiling, pupils dilated to black pools, and he was whispering something Evans couldn't quite hear.

It sounded like... singing?

No. Not singing. Growing.

The monitors settled. David's eyes closed again, sedation pulling him back under. Evans stood frozen, scalpel still in hand, heart pounding against his ribs.

This would make his career or end it.

Probably both.

He left the room, stripped off the protective gear, and went back to the observation window. Pulled out his phone and began searching for precedents, cases, anything remotely similar.

Hours passed. The sun rose fully outside the hospital windows. Nurses changed shifts. Evans barely noticed.

He was still there when the girlfriend—Betsy—was admitted to isolation room five with identical symptoms.

Evans stared at the notification on his tablet, then looked back at David through the glass.

The growth had spread to his chest. Visible beneath the hospital gown. Creeping upward like ivy on a wall.

"What are you?" Evans whispered to the sleeping figure.

No answer came.

But deep in his gut—in a place he didn't want to acknowledge—Evans felt the first stirrings of something that might have been understanding. Or might have been fear.

Or both.

### Scene 5: Betsy Goes Home

> Bark and Branch, look within.  
> You'll know soon that we will win.

They sent her home at noon. "Come back tomorrow," the nurse said, handing Betsy a card with Dr. Evans' number. "If your symptoms worsen, call immediately. Otherwise, we'll run more tests in the morning."

Betsy took the card. Counted the numbers printed on it. Ten digits. She counted them twice to be sure, then put the card in her pocket and walked to her car.

The apartment was exactly as they'd left it. David's coffee mug in the sink, still half-full from yesterday morning. His jacket on the back of the chair. His smell everywhere—sweat and soap and the faint sweetness of cannabis.

She stood in the doorway and counted. Counted the mugs in the cupboard. Seven. Counted the shoes by the door. Four pairs. Counted the books on the shelf. Twenty-three.

Her stomach hurt. A dull, persistent ache that had been there since the hospital, maybe before. She pressed her hand against it and felt something shift inside. Just gas, probably. Stress. Fear.

She should eat.

The fridge hummed. She opened it and stared at the contents without seeing them. Closed it again. Counted to thirty. Opened it. Closed it.

She wasn't hungry.

The shower called to her. She stood under the water and counted to three hundred, just like she did every morning, but the water didn't wash away the feeling of wrongness that had settled into her bones.

When she got out, she couldn't find clothes that fit. Her jeans wouldn't button. Even her loose sweats felt tight around the waist. She pulled on one of David's t-shirts instead, soft and worn and smelling like him.

The ache in her stomach pulsed. She lay down on their bed—her bed now, just hers, at least for tonight—and curled on her side.

Counted the knots in the wood of the ceiling beam. Eleven.

Counted the cars passing on the street below. Lost count at seventeen.

Counted her breaths. In for four. Out for six. In for four. Out for six.

Somewhere between breath forty-seven and forty-eight, she felt it.

A whisper, soft as wind through leaves.

*You're not alone.*

Betsy's eyes snapped open. The apartment was empty. Silent except for the hum of the fridge, the tick of the clock, the distant sound of traffic.

She pressed her hand to her stomach again. The ache bloomed into warmth.

*I'll take care of you. Both of you.*

She should be terrified. She counted reasons to be afraid. David in isolation. Her own symptoms starting. Something impossible happening inside her body.

But the warmth spread, and with it came a strange, settling calm.

Betsy closed her eyes and started counting backwards from one hundred.

She was asleep before she reached seventy.
