# Who Gardens the Gardeners? - Expansion Project

## Project Overview

**Original Publication**: January 26, 2021 - douglangille.ca  
**Original Scope**: Flash fiction (~1,100 words)  
**Target Scope**: Novelette (7,500-10,000 words)  
**Expansion Factor**: 7-9x  
**Project Started**: December 23, 2025

## Synopsis

A body horror/sci-fi story about David who swallows an acorn on a dare from his girlfriend Betsy. What begins as a joke transforms into a terrifying metamorphosis as the acorn grows inside him, transforming his body from the inside out. The story follows David's transformation in a hospital while Betsy begins experiencing similar symptoms. It culminates with both lovers escaping to the forest where they complete their transformation into trees, joining "Tree" and her family.

## Why Expand?

The original flash fiction has exceptional bones but covers 2+ months of story time in compressed space. The most emotionally resonant moments—Betsy's transformation journey, David's experience of changing, the hospital escape, and joining the forest collective—are summarized rather than shown. The story wants room to breathe.

## Expansion Strategy

**Preserve**:
- Opening scene (the dare, the acorn, perfect voice)
- Tree's poetic refrains (structural spine)
- Dr. Evans' clinical note format
- Ending image (rooting together in the glade)
- Horror-wonder-acceptance tonal balance
- David's sensory transformation descriptions

**Expand**:
- **Act 1**: Add ER admission, Betsy's early symptoms, Dr. Evans as character
- **Act 2**: Show David's transformation experience, multiple Betsy POV scenes, connection moment, secondary characters
- **Act 3**: Full escape sequence, journey to forest, meeting the collective, rooting ceremony

## Three-Act Structure

- **Act 1** (20% / 1,500-2,000 words): Dare through hospitalization
- **Act 2** (60% / 4,500-6,000 words): Containment, transformation, connection
- **Act 3** (20% / 1,500-2,000 words): Escape, journey, joining

## POV Distribution

- David (close third) - 50%
- Betsy (close third) - 25%
- Dr. Evans (clinical notes + reflection) - 15%
- Tree (poetic refrains + epilogue) - 10%

## Workflow

Following **EXPANSION-BOOTSTRAP** from story-engine/bootstraps/

**Phase 1**: Foundation Review ⏳  
**Phase 2**: Structure Planning ⏳  
**Phase 3**: Incremental Building ⏳  
**Phase 4**: Integration & Polish ⏳

## Focus Areas

1. Character interiority (especially Betsy and Dr. Evans)
2. World-building (What is Tree? Who else is there?)
3. Scene construction (turn summaries into full scenes)
4. Emotional arc (horror → curiosity → acceptance)

## Notes

This is an expansion, not a replacement. The original flash fiction remains as published. This expanded edition explores what happens when the story has room to breathe and develop its most compelling moments fully.
