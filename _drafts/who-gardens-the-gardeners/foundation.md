## Preserve (Do Not Change)

### Core Scenes

1. **Opening scene under the oak** - The dare, the acorn swallow, Betsy's shirt, the afternoon together. This is pitch-perfect voice, character establishment, and setup. Keep it nearly verbatim.

2. **David waking in pain** - The night scene with Betsy, the swollen stomach, "Dreamed something. Inside. Inside me. Alive." The horror begins here and it works.

3. **The ending image** - Betsy and David rooting together in the glade, watching sunsets, lacing roots in embrace. This conclusion is exactly right.

4. **David's expanded sensory awareness** - The paragraph describing his omnidirectional perception, tasting/smelling/touching through air. This is the story's most evocative moment.

5. **The flower in Betsy's hair** - David growing a flower in her hair, her shudder, the wink. Perfect romantic/horrific beat.

### Voice & Style

- **David's conversational first-person**: Direct, slightly crude, young adult voice ("Miss Obvious", "Down the hatch")
- **Betsy's counting compulsion**: Subtle motif that suggests her need for control
- **Clinical/poetic contrast**: Dr. Evans' medical notes vs. Tree's verse
- **Sensory richness**: Strong smell/taste/touch descriptions
- **Sexual subtext**: The story's reproductive/transformation metaphor
- **Tonal balance**: Never tips fully into horror or wonder - maintains both

### Character Essence

- **David**: Impulsive, physical, accepts dares, capable of crude humor, loves Betsy
- **Betsy**: Playful, daring, uses sexuality, counts things, ultimately pragmatic
- **Tree**: Seductive but not malevolent, maternal, patient, certain

### Atmosphere

- **Heat and humidity**: Oppressive summer, cicadas, sweat
- **Body horror that becomes sensual**: Transformation that shifts from violation to intimacy
- **Inevitability**: Sense that this was always going to happen
- **Acceptance over resistance**: Characters move toward, not away from, transformation

### Structural Elements

- **Tree's poetic refrains**: Six verses marking transformation stages. These are the spine. Keep every word.
  1. "Hello, said Tree" (introduction)
  2. "Seed and Sprout" (germination)
  3. "Bark and Branch" (growth begins)
  4. "Grow the Leaf" (development)
  5. "From our Shade" (maturation)
  6. "Cut us, break us" (final transformation)
  7. "Hello, said Tree" (completion/family)

- **Multi-POV structure**: David first-person, Dr. Evans clinical notes, Betsy limited third, Tree verse

### Character Development

**David**:
- **Backstory to reveal**: Why is he impulsive? What's his relationship with risk? Does he have family trying to reach him?
- **Arc to develop**: Horror → Curiosity → Desire → Acceptance (currently happens off-page)
- **Relationships**: With Betsy (deepen their bond), with Dr. Evans (antagonist/observer), with Tree (seduction)

**Betsy**:
- **Backstory to reveal**: Her life before David, why she dares him, her relationship with control (counting)
- **Arc to develop**: Fear → Denial → Recognition → Acceptance (currently completely off-page)
- **Relationships**: With David (lover to something beyond), with doctors (resistance to compliance), with Tree (fear to trust)
- **Agency needed**: She needs to make choices, not just react

**Dr. Evans**:
- **Character to create**: Currently just a note-taking device
- **Personality**: Dedicated researcher? Ambitious? Ethical person in impossible situation?
- **Arc to develop**: Professional distance → Fascination → Moral crisis → ?
- **Stake to establish**: What does he want? To cure them? Study them? Save them? Stop it spreading?
- **Possible**: Does Tree call to him too? Does he resist or succumb?

**Tree**:
- **Nature to clarify**: What IS Tree? Ancient forest intelligence? Alien? Evolved consciousness? Magic?
- **History to reveal**: How long has this been happening? Who else has joined? Why?
- **Motivation to establish**: Why does Tree want humans? What's the purpose of the collective?
- **Voice to expand**: More verses? Direct communication? Visions/dreams?

### World-Building

**The Forest**:
- Where is this? Rural area near city with hospital?
- How big is the collective? Dozens? Hundreds?
- What do transformed trees do? Just exist peacefully or something more?
- Are there different stages/types of transformation?
- What happens to human memories/consciousness in tree form?

**The Transformation**:
- Is it contagious? (Seems yes, given Betsy)
- How is it transmitted? (Touch? Air? The acorn specifically?)
- Can it be stopped/reversed?
- What's the timeline? (Currently 2+ months for David)
- What determines who gets called?

**The Hospital/Medical Response**:
- How do authorities react to impossible biology?
- Quarantine protocols?
- Other cases or just David and Betsy?
- Media attention?
- Family trying to intervene?

**The Fire**:
- Who started it? (David/Betsy? Tree? Accident?)
- Casualties?
- Cover-up or public knowledge?

### Emotional Beats to Extend

1. **David's terror** - When he first realizes what's happening, before acceptance
2. **Betsy's love and helplessness** - Wanting to help David, unable to
3. **The separation** - David hospitalized, Betsy alone
4. **Betsy's denial** - Her symptoms starting, refusing to acknowledge
5. **Betsy's recognition** - Moment she knows she's transforming too
6. **The connection** - First time they sense each other non-humanly
7. **David's temptation** - Tree offering something he wants
8. **Betsy's choice** - Deciding to join David rather than fight it
9. **Reunion** - Coming back together as something new
10. **Surrender** - Letting go of humanity, accepting Tree

## Integration Strategy

**Approach**: Expand from the original like growing rings on a tree trunk. The core (opening, refrains, key moments, ending) stays intact. New material grows around it, adding depth and context.

**Method**:
1. Keep original opening scene verbatim
2. Insert Act 1 expansion (ER, Betsy alone, Evans intro) after "I felt a twitch"
3. Replace Dr. Evans' single note with multiple dated entries interwoven with new scenes
4. Add David consciousness scenes throughout Act 2
5. Add Betsy parallel transformation scenes throughout Act 2
6. Insert connection scene before current "David was awake" section
7. Keep "David was awake" paragraph largely intact
8. Expand escape from one sentence to full scene
9. Add journey and meeting collective scenes
10. Expand ending rooting scene
11. Add Tree epilogue

**Pacing Principle**: The original moves fast because it's short. The expansion slows down the middle (containment) to build tension and character, then accelerates the escape for dramatic release, then slows again for contemplative ending.

**Voice Consistency**: 
- David scenes: First-person, his voice
- Betsy scenes: Close third, her interiority
- Evans scenes: Clinical notes that become more personal/disturbed over time
- Tree scenes: Poetic verse, occasional direct voice

**Transition Strategy**: Use Tree's verses as section breaks. Each verse introduces a new transformation stage and the scenes that follow explore that stage.
