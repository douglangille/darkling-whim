## Integration Strategy

### Original Material Placement

**Preserved Verbatim**:
- Scene 1: Opening (250 words)
- Scene 15: Flower in hair moment (150 words)
- Scene 20: Rooting ending (150 words)
- All Tree verses (7 verses, ~450 words total)

**Total Original Preserved**: ~1,000 words (91% of original)

**Modified/Expanded**:
- Scene 2: Night terror (+50 words)
- Scene 10: Evans' first note (original descriptive content preserved, context expanded)
- Scene 11: Betsy's morning (original details preserved, expanded)
- Scene 14: David's awareness (original sensory paragraph preserved, approach added)

**Discarded**: ~100 words of transitional summary that new scenes replace

### Pacing Strategy

**Act 1 Pacing**: MODERATE
- Scene 1: Quick, energetic (original pace)
- Scenes 2-5: Slowing down to establish stakes
- Builds tension through separation and medical impossibility

**Act 2 Pacing**: SLOW BUILD
- Early scenes: Confusion, resistance, fear
- Middle scenes: Understanding growing, acceptance beginning
- Later scenes: Connection forming, peace emerging
- Uses time jumps (week by week) to cover 2 months
- Evans notes provide time markers

**Act 3 Pacing**: RAPID THEN CONTEMPLATIVE  
- Scene 17: Fast, urgent, chaotic (the escape)
- Scene 18: Flowing, dreamlike (the journey)
- Scene 19: Timeless, welcoming (the meeting)
- Scene 20: Eternal, peaceful (the rooting)

### Transition Mechanisms

**Between Acts**:
- Tree verses mark major transitions
- Each verse introduces new transformation stage

**Within Acts**:
- POV shifts signal scene changes
- Time jumps explicit in Evans' dated notes
- Scene breaks marked by white space

**Voice Consistency**:
- David: Casual, direct, increasingly strange
- Betsy: Practical, counting, emotional underneath
- Evans: Professional degrading to obsessed
- Tree: Poetic, patient, certain

---

## World-Building Decisions (For Consistency)

### What is Tree?
- The lightning-split oak from the opening scene
- Ancient consciousness awakened by lightning strike
- Not alien - terrestrial intelligence, always here
- Connected to all trees but this one is awakened/aware
- Has transformed humans before (over centuries)

### How Does Transformation Work?
- Contact with awakened tree required (David and Betsy both touched it)
- Acorn was catalyst not cause
- Spreads through touch initially, then through air proximity
- Takes 2+ months to complete
- Conscious participation required - forced transformation impossible
- Voice/call intensifies as transformation progresses

### What Happens After?
- Transformed beings retain consciousness
- Individual and collective simultaneously
- Peaceful existence, aware of surroundings
- Can sense each other, Tree, the forest
- Time perception changes (seasons, not hours)
- Still love, still connect, but differently

### The Fire?
- Started by David and Betsy (not consciously, but through their power)
- Manifestation of Tree's "death by Fire" verse
- Protective - prevents pursuit
- No human casualties (people evacuate)
- Hospital destroyed but forest preserved

### Evans' Fate?
- Ambiguous in story
- Heard Tree's call
- Either resisted and left broken, or helped them and found peace
- Could return in future stories
- Leave unresolved

## Questions for Author Approval

Before proceeding to drafting, please confirm:

1. **Target word count** (8,500 words) feels right? Or prefer shorter/longer?
2. **Three-act structure** with these proportions works?
3. **POV distribution** - comfortable with Betsy getting equal time to David?
4. **Dr. Evans' ambiguous fate** - or prefer clear resolution?
5. **Tree's nature** (awakened oak) - or prefer more mystery?
6. **Timeline** (9 weeks) - or compress/extend?
7. **The fire** (David/Betsy cause it) - or different origin?
8. **Original preservation** - happy with keeping ~90% verbatim?
