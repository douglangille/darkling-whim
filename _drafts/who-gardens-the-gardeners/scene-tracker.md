## Notes

**Authorship Strategy**: 
- Preserved scenes (1, parts of 2, 10, 11, 14, 15, 19, 20) = Original author
- Minor expansions to preserved (Scene 2) = Human first draft
- Substantial new scenes = AI first draft, author voice refinement
- This balances efficiency with voice control

**Integration Points**:
- Scenes 1-2: Preserved sequence
- Scenes 3-5: New material bridges to Act 2
- Tree verses distributed throughout (mark in draft)
- Original climactic moments preserved in Scenes 15, 20

**Voice Anchors**:
- Scene 1: David's voice baseline
- Scenes 3, 5: Establish Betsy's distinct voice
- Scene 4: Establish Evans' clinical voice
