- Three-act structure with 20 scenes

### ✅ Phase 2: Structure Planning (Complete)

**Plan Approved**: Yes, December 23, 2025

**Structure Overview**:
- **Act 1**: 5 scenes, 1,800 words (21%)
- **Act 2**: 11 scenes, 5,100 words (60%)
- **Act 3**: 4 scenes, 1,600 words (19%)
- **Total**: 20 scenes, 8,500 words

**Timeline**: 9 weeks (Day 0 through Week 9)

**POV Distribution**:

- Dr. Evans (clinical/personal): 19%
- Alternating/Tree: 12%
- Tree verses: 5%

## Voice & Style Guidelines (Author-Approved)

### Betsy's Voice
- Distinct and feminine but young and contemporary like David
- Not as crass but not a prude either
- "Adult in the relationship, but only barely"
- Free-spirited but coming into maturity
- Tries to impose order (counting) but wild underneath

### Dr. Evans' Voice
- Start clinical and professional
- Degrade gradually as Tree's influence grows
- Medical language breaking down, poetic/strange creeping in
- The corruption happens in the prose itself
- Stay as clinical as possible but show the breakdown

### Profanity & Language
- Can go stronger than original (fuck, shit) but not gratuitous
- Keep grounded so Tree's verses don't clash tonally
- Contemporary, working-class dialogue

### Sexual Content
- Stay sensual and implicit mostly
- Explicit only if it serves the story
- Through-line is important (transformation as sexual/reproductive metaphor)
- Don't shy away when needed but not gratuitous

### Horror Tone Progression
- Dark humor consistent early
- Shifts toward horrific + serene + alien as story deepens
- Visceral yes, nauseating no
- Reader should be uncomfortable and holding breath, not repulsed
- Push boundaries where it serves story

### Supporting Characters
- Keep minimal - if names matter, give them
- Everyone gets personality and slight quirk
- No cast of thousands
- Functional but human

### The Forest Collective
- Collective presence, not individuals
- Alien feeling, inhuman
- Maybe plurality or chorus effect
- Don't "meet" specific tree-people

### Setting
- Contemporary exurban Maritime Canada vibe
- Implied, not explicit (no named cities)
- Regional hospital feel (like Colchester East Hants Health Centre)
- Big oak on hill near river (Vinegar Hill reference)
- Let readers fill in mental geography
- Evans might come from city (Halifax vibe) but don't specify

### Tree's Communication
- Speaks in verse only when "speaking"
- Can drift to metaphor as needed
- Translation from inhuman to human-recognizable
- Not dialogue - more sensation becoming words

### Cannabis Detail
- Keep the "special gummies" mention (contemporary, rule-breaking youth)
- But doesn't pass Chekov's gun test
- Just dressing, don't make it mean anything
- Could be swapped for beer/rum but detail is generation-specific

---

## World-Building Decisions

### What is Tree?
- The lightning-split oak from opening scene (full circle)
- Ancient consciousness awakened by lightning strike
- Not alien - terrestrial intelligence, always here
- Connected to all trees but this one is awakened/aware
- Has transformed humans before (over centuries)

### How Transformation Works
- Contact with awakened tree required (both touched it)
- Acorn was catalyst not cause
- Spreads through touch initially, then air proximity
- Takes 9 weeks to complete (detailed timeline in plan)
- Conscious participation required - can't be forced
- Voice/call intensifies as transformation progresses

### What Happens After?
- Transformed beings retain consciousness
- Individual and collective simultaneously
- Peaceful existence, aware of surroundings
- Can sense each other, Tree, the forest
- Time perception changes (seasons not hours)
- Still love, still connect, but differently

### The Fire
- Started by David and Betsy (unconscious power manifestation)
- Manifestation of Tree's "death by Fire" verse
- Protective - prevents pursuit
- No human casualties (evacuation happens)
- Hospital destroyed, forest preserved

### Evans' Fate
- Ambiguous in story (author approved)
- Heard Tree's call
- Either resisted and left broken, or helped them and found peace
- Leave unresolved
- Could return in future stories

## Next Phase: Phase 3 - Incremental Building

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Draft Act 1 (Scenes 1-5)** - ~1,800 words
   - Scene 1: The Dare (250w) - PRESERVE ORIGINAL
   - Scene 2: Night Terror (200w) - MINOR EXPANSION
   - Scene 3: Emergency Room (600w) - NEW, Betsy POV
   - Scene 4: Dr. Evans First Encounter (500w) - NEW, Evans POV
   - Scene 5: Betsy Goes Home (250w) - NEW, Betsy POV

2. **Author review of Act 1** for voice/tone confirmation

3. **Draft Act 2 (Scenes 6-16)** - ~5,100 words (if Act 1 approved)

4. **Draft Act 3 (Scenes 17-20)** - ~1,600 words

5. **Integration & Polish Pass**

### Drafting Strategy

**Recommendation**: Draft full Act 1 in one session, then pause for author review. This allows early course-correction on voice/style before investing in Acts 2-3.

**Alternative**: Scene-by-scene with check-ins (slower but more iterative)

**Author Preference**: TBD on resume
