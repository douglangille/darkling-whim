## Project Artifacts

- `assessment.md` - Complete assessment with all three phases
- `original.md` - Copy of published version for reference
- README.md (this file) - Project status and history

## Next Steps

1. Load REVISION-BOOTSTRAP.md
2. Apply high-impact technical fixes:
   - Tense consistency in hospital chaos
   - Conscience voice clarity ("You have no idea" line)
   - Parallel structure in cemetery scene
   - Timeline clarity (three-month reference)
3. Review optional polish opportunities
4. Generate revised version

## Notes

- Story structure is perfect - do not alter time jump or cyclical ending
- Expansion would weaken impact - flash length is ideal
- Focus is purely technical polish, not structural revision
