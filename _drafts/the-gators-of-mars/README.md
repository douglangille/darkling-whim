## Workflow History

### Session 1: December 29, 2025 - ASSESSMENT
**Bootstrap**: ASSESSMENT-BOOTSTRAP.md  
**Phases Completed**: All 3 phases

**Key Findings**:
- Story is complete and optimal at flash fiction length (~720 words)
- Reactive/accidental causality is CORE to its power
- Expansion would destroy the fatalistic dark comedy
- Needs precision polish, not expansion
- Recommended path: REVISION only

**Assessment Document**: `assessment.md`

**Next Steps**:
- Load REVISION-BOOTSTRAP.md
- Focus on high-impact line edits
- Target: 600-650 words through compression
- Preserve: reactive causality, ambiguous ending, dark comedy tone

## Important Notes

**DO NOT EXPAND THIS STORY**

The prior scope discussion definitively concluded:
- The narrator's arc is complete at egg discovery
- "I sit and wait" is narrative closure, not act break
- Survival would negate the ending
- Expansion would require making the reactive protagonist proactive (kills the story)

**Universe Potential**: Yes - other Neo Amsterdam stories with different doomed specialists, but NOT this protagonist's story.

**Revision Goal**: Polish the gem, don't expand it.
