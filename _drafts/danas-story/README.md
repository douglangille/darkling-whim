# Dana's Story - Revision Project

**Original Publication**: March 29, 2013 (douglangille.ca)  
**Original Word Count**: ~3,000 words  
**Project Initiated**: December 30, 2025  
**Workflow**: REVISION (surgical improvements at compressed scope)

---

## Project Status

**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Analysis (Complete - using dual assessments)  
**Next Phase**: Phase 2 - Planning  
**Target Word Count**: 4,500-5,000 words  
**Estimated Sessions**: 2-3

## Workflow History

- **December 30, 2025**: Project initialized
  - Dual assessments completed (AI + previous human assessment)
  - Consensus: REVISION path, not expansion
  - Key insight: Compression is strength, needs surgical precision not breathing room
  - Bootstrap selected: REVISION-BOOTSTRAP.md

## Core Story Elements

**Premise**: A veteran with PTSD and possible military mind-control programming snaps during a camping trip with childhood friends, leading to a violent confrontation where her best friend must kill her.

**Genre**: Psychological horror / Military sci-fi  
**Structure**: Three-POV rotation (Prim → Dana → Prim)  
**Heart**: Betrayal and loss of childhood friendship, destroyed by trauma and weaponization

**Critical Preservation**:
- Dana's reactive/triggered agency (not chosen violence)
- Compression and velocity (horror depends on whiplash)
- "Time to Foxtrot" as unexplained trigger
- Ambiguity about Control
- Fire imagery through-line
- Tragic inevitability

---

## Revision Strategy

**Approach**: Surgical improvements - add ~1,000-2,000 words maximum

**High Priority Revisions**:
1. Cut Control's dialogue entirely (keep visual threat only)
2. Sharpen trigger moment (Dana fights activation, loses)
3. Give Prim harder choice at ending (active decision, not panic-fire)
4. Prune backstory exposition
5. Fix bathroom scene pacing (cut rhetorical questions, add concrete memory)
6. Resolve Maggie's fate
7. Tighten fire imagery recursion
8. Fix repetition error (Crawford dialogue)

## Key Insights from Dual Assessment

**From AI Assessment**:
- Identified expansion candidates (which we're now avoiding)
- Strong causality/agency analysis
- Recognized compressed timeline as weakness (now reframed as strength)

**From Previous Assessment**:
- "The brutality depends on compression" - key insight
- Diagnostic test: "What would you add?" revealed expansion adds context, not story
- Control character is pure exposition device
- Bathroom scene drowning in rhetorical questions
- Fire imagery needs one more layer of recursion

**Synthesis**:
- This is intentional compression, not insufficient development
- Horror velocity comes from whiplash, not buildup
- Surgical revisions strengthen existing power, don't explain it away
- Every addition must serve velocity
