## Project Overview

This project focuses on polishing "The Way Home," a complete and successful flash fiction piece about a recently divorced woman experiencing highway hypnosis and microsleep while driving home exhausted.

**Assessment Verdict**: Story is structurally complete at flash length. Needs polish, NOT expansion. The compression is the mechanism of impact.

## Workflow History

### Session 1: December 30, 2025
- **Bootstrap**: ASSESSMENT-BOOTSTRAP.md
- **Phases Completed**: All 3 phases
- **Outcome**: Recommendation for REVISION path (polish)
- **Key Decision**: Keep bull-men endowment detail (adds to absurdist dream-logic horror)
- **Artifacts Created**:
  - `assessment.md` - Complete assessment with all 3 phases
  - `revision-plan.md` - Prioritized revision tasks
  - `the-way-home-original.md` - Copy of published version
  - `older-assessment-notes.md` - Previous analysis for reference

## Next Steps

**Next Bootstrap**: REVISION-BOOTSTRAP.md  
**Focus**: Light polish (1-2 sessions estimated)

**Priorities**:
1. Cut "Wake up" dialogue (trust visual cues)
2. Add sensory highway detail between hallucinations
3. Clarify first transition for first-time readers
4. Consider Maritime-specific details (salt spreader vs tractor trailer)
5. Fragment final line ("Almost home" vs "She was almost home")
6. Earlier echo of ring finger detail

## Key Insights from Assessment

**What Makes This Work**:
- Three-layer nested unreality structure (reality → bull-men → mountain → reality)
- Reactive character agency (things happen TO Gwen, not BY her)
- Compression creates breathless pacing that mirrors exhaustion
- Divorce grief as deeper subtext beneath drowsy driving PSA surface
- Absurdist dream-logic (bull-men endowment) mixing with genuine horror

**Core That Must Be Preserved**:
- Flash fiction length (expansion would create different/lesser story)
- Reactive/accidental nature of hallucinations
- Single moment of crisis (not character development arc)
- Ambiguous ending ("almost home" but danger still present)
