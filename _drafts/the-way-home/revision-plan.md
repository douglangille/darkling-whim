**Created**: December 30, 2025

## Revision Priorities

### HIGH IMPACT (Must Do)

#### 1. Cut "Wake up, Gwen... Wake up now"
**Location**: Mountain climber dialogue  
**Current**: 
> "Wake up, Gwen," he said. "Wake up now."

**Revision**: Remove the dialogue entirely. Let him wave silently. Trust the visual cues and the subsequent horn blast to do the work.

**Why**: This is too on-the-nose. The story is strong enough to work without explicit instruction. Silence is more chilling.

**Impact**: Makes the moment more subtle and trusting of the reader. Increases unease.

---

#### 2. Add Highway Sensory Detail
**Location**: Opening paragraph + between hallucinations  
**Current**: Limited sensory grounding in the actual drive

**Add**:
- Opening: More highway hypnosis details (taillights blurring, white line rhythm)
- During drive: Heater fan drone, wiper blade rhythm, weight of eyelids
- Make the REAL more intensely real so the surreal jolts harder

**Why**: We need stronger grounding in the dangerous reality she's drifting from. The contrast makes the hallucinations land harder.

**Impact**: Increases immersion and makes the twist more effective.

---

#### 3. Clarify First Transition
**Location**: "Gwen shuffled up the walk..."  
**Current**: Reads like she's actually at her house initially

**Revision Options**:
- Add small signal before: "Her eyes drifted closed. When she opened them..."
- Or adjust phrasing: "She saw herself shuffle up the walk..."
- Or: Lean into the confusion but make door-opening moment clearer

**Why**: First-time readers stumble here. We want them disoriented but not confused about basic plot mechanics.

**Impact**: Smoother first read without losing the hallucinatory effect.

---

### MEDIUM IMPACT (Should Do)

#### 4. Fragment Final Line
**Location**: Last line  
**Current**: 
> She was almost home.

**Revision**: 
> Almost home.

**Why**: Fragmenting POV for final beat puts us directly in her compromised headspace. More unsettling.

**Impact**: Stronger, more haunting ending.

---

#### 5. Earlier Ring Finger Echo
**Location**: Early in the story (opening or first hallucination response)  
**Current**: Ring finger only mentioned at the end

**Add**: One earlier mention of her hand on the wheel, the absent weight, something subtle. Don't announce it—just plant it.

**Example**: "She gripped the steering wheel, thumb rubbing the naked base of her ring finger."

**Why**: The ending revelation hits harder if we've been subtly prepared. Classic plant-and-payoff.

**Impact**: Deeper emotional resonance at the climax.

---

#### 6. Cut "Of course, she was too late"
**Location**: After Gwen tries to stifle her reaction to bull-men  
**Current**: 
> Gwen snapped her hand to her mouth to stifle both the giggle and scream that comes with absurd horror. Of course, she was too late.

**Revision**: Delete "Of course, she was too late." Go directly to:
> Gwen snapped her hand to her mouth to stifle both the giggle and scream that comes with absurd horror.
> 
> One of the creatures heard the noise...

**Why**: This is telling, not showing. We see her fail; we don't need to be told.

**Impact**: Tighter prose, more trust in reader.

---

### LOW IMPACT / STYLE CHOICE (Consider)

#### 7. Maritime Specifics
**Location**: "tractor trailer" references  
**Current**: Generic "tractor trailer" and "truck"

**Revision Options**: 
- "salt spreader" (very Nova Scotia winter-specific)
- "pulp truck" (Maritime logging industry)
- "18-wheeler"

**Why**: Grounds story in specific place without announcing location. Subtle regional authenticity.

**Decision**: Test during revision. If it feels natural, do it. If it feels forced, leave generic.

**Impact**: Minor. Adds texture if done well; risks distraction if overdone.

---

## Author Decisions Already Made

✅ **KEEP the bull-men endowment detail** - "male endowment waggled in their own rhythm"  
**Rationale**: Perfect absurdist dream-logic. Wrong-genre-wrong-tone wrongness is essential to the horror-comedy blend. This is what makes the hallucination feel *real* as a hallucination.

---

## Revision Order (Suggested)

### Session 1: Line-Level Fixes
1. Cut "Wake up" dialogue
2. Cut "Of course, she was too late"
3. Fragment final line to "Almost home"
4. Clarify first transition

### Session 2: Enrichment & Polish
5. Add highway sensory details (opening + throughout)
6. Add earlier ring finger echo
7. Consider Maritime specifics (test and decide)
8. Final read-through for flow

## Success Criteria

Revision is complete when:
- ✅ All HIGH IMPACT items addressed
- ✅ All MEDIUM IMPACT items addressed or consciously declined
- ✅ Story reads smoothly on first pass (no confusion)
- ✅ Hallucinations hit harder due to sensory grounding
- ✅ Emotional beats land with more weight
- ✅ Word count stays within flash fiction range (~850-950 words)
- ✅ Nothing added that dilutes the compression or reactive agency

---

## What NOT to Do

❌ **Don't expand scope** - This is polish, not expansion  
❌ **Don't add scenes** - No prologue, no aftermath, no flashbacks  
❌ **Don't explain** - Trust the reader, trust the structure  
❌ **Don't make Gwen proactive** - She must remain reactive; things happen TO her  
❌ **Don't cut the bull-men detail** - Author decision is to KEEP  
❌ **Don't moralize** - No PSA energy, no lessons learned
