# AI Writing Ethics Position Statement

**Project Type:** Blog Post / About Page Update  
**Status:** Analysis Complete - Ready for Drafting  
**Started:** January 15, 2026  
**Source:** Conversation analyzing AI use in creative writing workflow

## Project Overview

This project documents my position on AI use in creative writing, addressing:
- Creative integrity and authorial control
- Neurodivergent accessibility considerations
- Professional vs. amateur discourse dynamics
- Disclosure obligations and transparency
- Historical parallels and moral panic patterns

## Intended Outputs

1. **Blog post:** Detailed exploration of AI writing ethics from practitioner perspective
2. **About/AI page update:** Disclosure statement for douglangille.ca

## Key Arguments

### Creative Integrity
- AI as tool, not replacement for authorial vision
- Voice and creative decisions remain human domain
- Quality of final work validates approach

### Accessibility Framing
- AI as executive function accommodation for ADHD/autism
- Structure and pace matter for neurodivergent creators
- Tools remove barriers without replacing creativity

### Professional Reality
- Working writers use available tools pragmatically
- Process purity is amateur virtue signaling
- Readers care about quality, not romantic notions of struggle

### Disclosure Position
- Transparent about AI use in workflow
- Maintains authorial control and voice
- Final work reflects human creative vision and craft
