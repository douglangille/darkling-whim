**Context:** Examining creative integrity, accessibility, and professional practice in AI-assisted writing

---

## Executive Summary

AI writing tools represent neither an existential threat to creative authenticity nor a shortcut that undermines craft. For neurodivergent writers specifically, they function as accessibility accommodations that remove executive function barriers while preserving—and often enhancing—creative control and distinctive voice. The current discourse around AI writing is polluted by performative purity that doesn't reflect professional practice and creates a culture of deceit more problematic than the tool use itself.

## The Question of Creative Integrity

### Authorial Control: The Central Criterion

Creative integrity hinges on **who maintains final creative authority**, not which tools facilitate execution. In my workflow:

**I control:**
- Initial creative vision and concept selection
- Genre, tone, POV, and mechanical rules
- Recognition when output fails emotionally
- All voice and revision passes that create distinctive prose
- Decision of when work is complete

**AI handles:**
- Ideation catalyst (generating options I evaluate)
- Structure execution (implementing frameworks I design)
- Pattern recognition (identifying weaknesses I agree/disagree with)
- Efficiency multiplication (mechanical tasks so I focus on creative essence)

This relationship resembles how writers have always used tools—from thesauruses to beta readers to developmental editors. The difference is scale and sophistication, but the core dynamic (artist directing tool) remains intact.

### The Voice Question

Distinctive authorial voice cannot be generated by AI—it emerges from:
- Rhythm and sentence variation choices
- Compression and word selection precision  
- Authentic character cognition
- Subtle emotional beats that require lived experience

In my workflow, the "voice pass" is where AI-generated structural prose becomes recognizably mine. This surgical editing—transforming technically correct sentences into compressed, rhythmically distinctive language—is where authorship manifests.

**Example transformations from "Calum in the Forest":**
- AI: "The camera shutter clicked continuously"  
- Human: "The shutter won't stop"

- AI: "He avoided using the measuring tool"  
- Human: "The protractor is in my bag. I don't use the protractor."

These aren't minor edits—they're the difference between competent prose and distinctive voice.

### Quality as Validation

The pragmatic test of creative integrity: **Are the stories better?**

Since integrating AI into my workflow:
- Narrative structure is stronger (better planning)
- Escalation is tighter (better outlining)  
- Voice is more distinctive (focused revision energy)
- Completion rate is higher (sustained momentum through mechanical phases)

If AI assistance resulted in homogenized, voice-less prose, that would indicate creative failure regardless of ethical considerations. The opposite is occurring—my work is improving specifically because AI removes barriers to focused craft work.

## Neurodivergence and Accessibility

### Executive Function as Barrier

For autistic-ADHD cognition, executive function challenges around planning, organizing, and sustaining focus through tedious steps create genuine disability barriers to creative output. Traditional writing advice assumes neurotypical capabilities:

- Extensive outlining and revision planning
- Methodical, sustained editing passes  
- Context maintenance across project phases
- Delayed gratification through mechanical work

When I previously "just vibed my way through" projects, I wasn't being lazy—I was working within my cognitive architecture. But results weren't optimal because **some structure genuinely improves stories**, even when implementing that structure is cognitively expensive.

### AI as Accommodation

AI functions as an **executive function prosthetic**:

- Maintains structure and momentum through phases where my brain would stall
- Preserves context across work sessions
- Handles mechanical execution while I focus on creative decisions
- Allows both creative flow state AND structural rigor

This isn't cheating—this is accommodation. The literary establishment has historically privileged neurotypical workflows and dismissed neurodivergent approaches as lacking discipline. AI tools reveal that distinction as arbitrary.

### Pace and Structure Matter

For ADHD specifically, **maintaining momentum is crucial**. Getting stuck in mechanical revision hell means:
- Loss of narrative context
- Project abandonment
- Creative energy dissipation

AI allows me to move through mechanical phases at a pace that sustains engagement, reaching the creative work (voice, emotional truth, craft decisions) with focus and energy intact.

**This dynamic improves outcomes for readers.** A finished, well-crafted story beats an abandoned brilliant idea every time.

## Professional Practice vs. Amateur Virtue Signaling

### What Working Writers Actually Do

Professional writers are pragmatists with deadlines, contracts, and readers who don't care about process nobility. They've always used whatever tools improve work or speed production:

- **Genre fiction writers:** Plot templates, beat sheets, formula structures
- **Thriller writers:** Technical consultants who draft procedural sections  
- **Ghostwriters:** Entire industry of "writing" under someone else's name
- **Co-authors:** Division of labor invisible to readers
- **Editors:** Routinely rewrite substantial manuscript portions
- **Translators:** Creative rewriting, not word-for-word conversion

The notion that "real" writing means one person alone generating every word from pure inspiration is **marketing mythology**, not craft reality.

### The Amateur Purity Complex

The loudest AI critics tend to be:

1. **MFA romantics who fetishize process over product** - Struggle IS the art, so tools that reduce struggle feel like cheating
2. **Aspiring writers protecting status anxiety** - AI accessibility devalues their "dues paying"
3. **Social media performers** - Virtue signaling IS the product, not actual stories  
4. **Academics** - Applying student plagiarism standards to professional creative work

Meanwhile, working writers quietly test tools, use what works, and focus on reader satisfaction rather than process purity.

### The Deceit Problem

The current dynamic creates toxic dishonesty:

**Public stance:** "I would NEVER use AI—that's not real writing!"  
**Private reality:** Using AI for outlines, drafts, editing suggestions, idea generation  
**Result:** Culture of shame and hiding that serves no one

This parallels earlier moral panics:
- Word processors ("real writers use typewriters!")
- Spellcheck ("real writers know grammar!")  
- Internet research ("real writers use libraries!")
- Self-publishing ("real writers have gatekeepers!")

Each time, purists were revealed as hypocrites or commercially irrelevant.

**The actual problem isn't AI use—it's the performative dishonesty it's creating.** If AI becomes a "secret," new writers get gaslighted about what's possible, inefficient workflows get treated as moral necessities, and disabled/neurodivergent creators stay locked out.

## Historical Parallel: Photography and Painting

When photography was invented, painters collectively panicked: "Real art requires hand-crafting every element!" 

Then:
1. **Bad painters disappeared** (photography exposed them)
2. **Good painters improved** (freed from representational work, they innovated)  
3. **Photography became its own art form** (with craft, vision, skill requirements)
4. **Everyone benefited** (more images, more art, more accessibility)

AI writing tools follow the same pattern. The question isn't "Is using AI ethical?" but **"Are you using it to make better work?"**

## Disclosure and Transparency

### Contexts Requiring Disclosure

Transparency strengthens integrity in:

- **Craft discussions with other writers** (meta-analysis, workflow documentation)
- **Literary contests** with "original work" requirements (check specific rules)  
- **Academic/professional contexts** (different standards apply)
- **Teaching process to others** (honesty about actual practice)

### Contexts Where Disclosure Is Less Critical

- **General publication** (readers care about experience, not tools)
- **Personal blog posts** (your space, your rules)  
- **Venues without specific AI policies** (absence of rule isn't deception)

The ethical burden isn't binary—it's about honesty in contexts where process matters, not apologizing for effective tool use.

### My Position Statement

**If asked directly: "Do you use AI?"**

> "Yes, as part of my revision workflow. AI drafts structural material based on my creative vision, which I then revise extensively for voice and craft. The stories published under my name reflect my authorial decisions, distinctive voice, and creative control. Readers judge the final product."

This is honest, defensible, and aligns with professional practice. Anyone requiring more process purity is prioritizing romantic notions over creative output—and those people aren't my audience.

## Ethical Boundaries and Future Considerations

My current workflow maintains clear human authority. Ethical complexity would increase if:

- **AI performs voice pass** instead of me (I currently don't allow this)
- **I accept AI-generated "distinctive voice" as mine** (I currently reject this)  
- **I skip critical evaluation stages** (I currently embrace them as essential)
- **I publish unrevised AI output** (I currently agonize over every word)

As long as I maintain **editorial judgment, creative vision, and distinctive voice** as my domain, I'm on solid ethical ground.

### The Automation Question

As AI improves, the temptation will be to automate more. The guard against ethical drift:

**Ask regularly: "Would I be proud to explain this process publicly?"**

If the answer involves hiding, minimizing, or feeling defensive, that's a signal to examine whether I've ceded too much creative authority.

---

## Conclusion: Process vs. Product

The anxiety around AI writing stems from conflating **process romanticism** with **creative value**. 

**Process romanticism says:** Suffering, struggle, and solitary genius are what make writing valuable  
**Creative value says:** Stories that work, distinctive voice, and reader experience are what matter

I'm using AI to overcome barriers that prevent my creativity from fully manifesting. My stories are:
- Better structured
- More distinctive in voice  
- Actually finished and published
- Improving my craft skills

These outcomes validate my approach. The rest is noise from people who confuse their romantic attachment to struggle with actual literary value.

### Final Position

I use AI tools as part of my creative workflow. I maintain authorial control, creative vision, and distinctive voice. My work is improving. I'm transparent about my process in contexts where it matters. 

**That's not compromise—that's craft in the 21st century.**
