## Workflow History

### January 14, 2026 - ASSESSMENT Started

**Session 1**: Initial Analysis (Phase 1)
- Completed deep read analysis
- Identified core elements (premise, promise, payoff, heart, theme)
- Analyzed causality and character agency (reactive with accidental discoveries)
- Documented strengths (voice, economy, dark humor, physical grounding)
- Identified 4 craft-level weaknesses (nickname continuity, magazine line, timeline, Mavis darkness)
- Status: ✅ Phase 1 Complete
- Commit: [58da460](https://github.com/douglangille/Workbench/commit/58da460197ff082164e3b75ce69f3d3aada233e6)

**Session 1 (continued)**: Scope Analysis (Phase 2)
- Evaluated current scope (560 words, single scene, 10-15 min story time)
- Tested expansion options (showing Larry alive, aftermath, world-building)
- **Key Decision**: Initially recommended EXPAND, then reversed to POLISH after extended reasoning
- Determined story is **compressed** (deliberate economy) not **cramped** (lacking space)
- Conclusion: Expansion would dilute rather than deepen impact
- Recommendation: REVISION/POLISH path for craft-level improvements
- Status: ✅ Phase 2 Complete (Revised)
- Commit: [0427df2](https://github.com/douglangille/Workbench/commit/0427df2ec0fdd9964582e77f454dc09928be31b3)

## Key Findings

### What Makes This Story Work

1. **Perfect flash fiction structure** - Single scene, sharp twist, transformative callback
2. **Exceptional voice** - Bitter, funny, vulnerable, authentic
3. **Accidental discovery** - Narrator's lack of control IS the emotional power
4. **Economic storytelling** - Every line serves multiple functions
5. **Title/metaphor alignment** - "From the Window" works literally and metaphorically

### What Needs Polish (Not Expansion)

1. Nickname consistency (Fatty vs Sweaty/Puffy)
2. Women's magazines line clarity
3. Timeline clarity (last week vs all week vs today)
4. Mavis poisoning line (darkness assessment)

### Critical Preservation Requirements

⚠️ **If any revision is done, MUST preserve**:
- Accidental nature of Larry's death discovery
- Narrator's reactive/trapped quality
- Voice consistency and rhythm
- Compression and economy
- Title callback transformation
- Larry's slippers as recognition moment
