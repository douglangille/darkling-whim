## Story Summary

Carnival workers play poker in a trailer during a rainstorm, unaware that missing lug nuts will cause the Ferris wheel to collapse on them when the weather clears. A tight workplace tragedy driven by dramatic irony—readers gradually understand the approaching doom while characters remain oblivious.

## Assessment Findings

### Recommendation: POLISH (REVISION path)

**Core Strengths**:
- Masterful dramatic irony structure
- Character economy through vivid details and nicknames
- Perfect pacing for flash length
- Lug nuts revelation as brilliant misdirection
- Title works on multiple levels
- Fatalistic power from reactive/circumstantial causality

**Key Issues to Address**:
1. Ending needs testing (three versions to evaluate)
2. Cranky's discovery moment needs more dramatic space
3. Line-level modifiers weakening prose
4. Spins/Teddy entrance disrupts flow
5. Wheeler's pain line needs refinement

**Do Not Change**:
- Dramatic irony mechanism (readers know, characters don't)
- Reactive/circumstantial causality (characters are victims of fate)
- Accidental discovery arriving too late
- Flash fiction scope and compression
- No heroics, no escape, no rescue

## Future Considerations

**Carnival Collection Concept**: Rather than expanding this story, consider writing other incidents at Callaghan's Carnival as separate flash pieces. The carnival becomes the through-line, not individual characters. Different disasters, near-misses, with occasional character overlap.

**File for**: Future IDEATION workflow
