# Eddie Zero - Revision Project

**Original Publication**: October 13, 2013 (anthology: Midnight Abyss)
**Current Word Count**: ~8,000 words
**Target Word Count**: ~7,437 words
**Status**: Assessment complete, ready for revision

## Project Overview

Standalone prequel to "Haley's War" - visceral zombie horror following Eddie (psychiatric patient) and Haley (traumatized teenager) as they survive a hospital outbreak and form an unlikely partnership.

## Workflow History

### December 30, 2025 - Assessment Phase
- Loaded ASSESSMENT-BOOTSTRAP.md
- Completed clean read assessment
- Compared against original assessment from previous session
- Identified causality/agency analysis: reactive survivors, accidental discoveries
- Created revised surgical edit plan biased to clean assessment
- **Key finding**: Story works at current scope - needs surgical revision, not expansion
- **Recommendation**: REVISION path (polish existing structure)

## Current Phase

**Phase**: Ready for REVISION-BOOTSTRAP Phase 2 (Structural)
**Next Session**: Load REVISION-BOOTSTRAP.md and execute surgical plan

## Key Files

- `assessment.md` - Complete assessment with causality analysis
- `surgical-edit-plan.md` - Detailed revision plan with specific cuts/additions
- `original-story.md` - Published version from _posts/ for reference

## Core Preservation Principles

**DO NOT CHANGE**:
- Reactive survival nature (no strategic planning)
- Accidental discoveries (lab stumbled upon, not sought)
- Eddie's voice (dark humor, complicated violence)
- Haley's volatility (dangerous, not reliable)
- Visceral action momentum

**DO CHANGE**:
- Pacing imbalance (cut 25% from first third)
- Haley's agency (expand gun moments)
- Barney's sacrifice (make it earned)
- Ending (replace summary with resonant image)

## Target Improvements

1. **Pacing**: -290 words from cell/Meier, -425 from hallway/common room
2. **Haley's Arc**: +230 words for agency moments (executing Barney, holding gun on Eddie)
3. **Ending**: +257 words replacing summary with thematic resonance
4. **Helicopter**: Seed once in Section 4 to reduce convenience
5. **Net Change**: -563 words (8,000 → 7,437)

## Session Estimates

- **Session 1**: Sections 1-4 (cuts + helicopter seed)
- **Session 2**: Section 5 (Barney + Haley expansions)
- **Session 3**: Sections 6-7 (tightening + ending replacement)

## Notes

- Original story remains published at `_posts/2013-10-13-eddie-zero.md`
- Revised version will be separate (v2.0)
- Haley character thread continues in "Haley's War" (in development)
