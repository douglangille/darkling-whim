I didn't kill him. He was already dead.

The room was pitch black when I awoke. I fell asleep leaning against the back of the door. My shoulders tingled as my circulation returned. It didn't help much. With my arms restrained like they were, it was nearly impossible to take a full breath. My head swam as my eyes adjusted to the dark. The sparks and flashes of dust motes disoriented me, awash in a sea of teaming life where darkness reigned.

The power had been out for a couple of days, from what I surmised from the dim glow ebbing and flowing through the wire-reinforced glass in the door. There was no real way to be sure though. Time was elastic for me at the best of times. These days? Well, let's just say things were different.

The hot, stale air reeked of my own sweat and stink, and his as well, I suppose. My foot shot out to kick him, landing with a wet thud. In some ways, I was thankful for the dark. The air exchangers were out, but there must have been some venting somewhere. My breathing grew frantic again, so I closed my eyes against the murk and did the breathing exercises Doctor Goodwin taught me. She was my favorite. She always smiled at me. At least she did when she possessed a face. *Bastards.*

We were in group session when the arse fell out of the world. Doctors Goodwin and Meier were running the show with a stuffed bear as a talking stick. Barry, Emma and Hughie went first, leaving me and Haley. I grew bored with Hughie's crying and Barry's whimpering, as he rocked back and forth. Haley stood, walked around her chair clockwise, and then counter-clockwise, humming a nursery rhyme. Meier guided her back to her seat. *Man, these people were nuts.*

Goodwin cell buzzed. She glanced at the number and excused herself to take it. I watched her shapely legs swish away with approval. *I hate to see you go, but I love to watch you leave,* I mused. Hughie stuffed that damnable bear in my face, blocking my view, and shook it like a rattle. I wanted to punch him. That was probably why I was in restraints.

"It's your turn, Eddie," said Meier. "Do you have anything to share this morning?"

"Fuck you."

Meier shook his head and bent forward to scribble in his chart. The bald spot looked like a tantalizing target. Goodwin came back, put her hand on her colleague's arm, and handed him a note. His glasses fell from his face and dangled around his neck from the chain that later facilitated his untimely demise.

The security alarm clanged as the double-doors at the back of the ward burst open. A small crowd of dishevelled-looking people broke into the room. They were all bloody and torn, but moved with a swiftness I hadn't thought possible. Immediate pandemonium erupted in a melee of gore and violence. Frozen in shock, I witnessed the escalation. Three assailants gnawed on Goodwin's pretty face after tackling her to the ground. Barry vomited all over his pajamas, but it didn't matter. He didn't make it out of the circle. None of them did.

Meier and I clambered over and around each other trying to get out the south door. I threw my body against the press bar and fell through. Still bound in the jacket, I panicked and yelled as I violently flopped around on the floor like a fish out of water. Meier, wide-eyed and bleeding, helped me stand and we bolted to the cell block to hide.

It wasn't until later I realized he'd been bitten.

***

I kicked Meier again. Nothing. I didn't mind hunger, but hated being thirsty. Drinking from the toilet had to be pretty much the lowest point of my miserable life.

The dark got to me. At first there was a lot of noise, but it'd been relatively quiet for some time. No screaming. No growling. With the power off, I faintly made out the sounds of the street below. Sirens. Gunfire. There was an explosion last night, but nothing in the ward.

Pacing around the cell helped me think. It wasn't mine, but Marky's. I can't remember. We weren't exactly reading room numbers, if you know what I mean. A lucky break in one hand and a dumb-ass move in the other, we hid in a cell that automatically sealed when closed. It needed to be unlocked from the outside. *Nice*.

Meier and I cowered like children, holding our breath. I begged him to take the jacket off, but he refused. Paranoid or just an asshole, who knows? *Rotten fucker. Glad he's dead. No, I won't take it back.*

The good doctor found Jesus, Allah and Buddha. He hedged his bets, I thought. Sometime after the first couple of long hours, he raved and babbled. The crowd of crazies on the other side of the door heard him and screamed incoherently, banging on the metal. The emergency lights were still on, and I worried they'd figure it out. They weren't likely getting inside without a working brain cell to spare. It was Meier who drove me batty.

All at once, he got quiet and passed out. Eventually, the crazies begged off to find other faces to peel and limbs to eat. I bent over him to listen for breathing. It would've been much easier with hands, of course. *Nothing.*

He sprang forward and growled like the freaks outside. I'd seen enough zombie movies to guess where this was going. I didn't get out of his way in time. He tripped over me, fell forward and slammed his head on the toilet with a dull thud. Not waiting to see if it slowed him down, I jumped on his back and dug my heels into his pudgy hips. Using my teeth, I grabbed the chain of his glasses and leaned back with all my weight, pinning him with my knees on his shoulders. His back arched so he couldn't get up. Meier kept trying to reach me with his hands, but his middle-age lifestyle didn't permit the flexibility. He gurgled and sputtered as he twisted and flailed. I rode him like a rodeo bull. *Yippie!*

Why the chain or spectacles didn't break, I have no idea. *Thank you, Jeebus.* With one of his jerks he threw me off, but I managed to hold on to the glasses. His neck snapped audibly and I lost a couple teeth. Meier shit himself and died again. That was that.

As I crossed the cell for the millionth time, I booted him again for good measure and stopped. Did I hear something? Was someone yelling? Yup. Words, not growls. It was Haley. Shit, of all my saviours, it had to be the obsessive-compulsive. I kicked the door with my feet. "Haley! Over here!"

"Haley!" Fuck, I tired of saying her name. "Haley, can you please open the manual door lock? Pull it out, turn it one-quarter, and push it back in. That's all you gotta do."  I had this place cased. I paid attention. I knew how things worked.

I saw her pacing back and forth through the glass, leaving little bloody footprints on the tile with her elasticized paper booties. Back and forth, chewing on her nails. "Eddie, I can't!" she squeaked. She was crying, of course. *That was useful.* "I can't make it three! It needs to be three! Doctor Goodwin said it was okay, but it's not!"

For Christ's sake, why did I draw this winner? "Listen to me. It is three. Three steps. Three God-forsaken, monkey-fightin' steps. Pull, twist, and push. Count 'em, Haley."

"No." She let out a huff of air. The motion shook her small frame. How old was she? Fourteen? She put her lower lip atop her upper and sat on the floor, arms and legs crossed. "You're being mean to me, Eddie. Doctor Goodwin said you had to be nice to me. Remember? I won't let you out until you say sorry."

I fought to not tear this little bitch a new one. I walked over and gave Meier another boot, then another one, real hard. I stretched my back as far as the jacket allowed. My shoulders cracked with the stress. My hands were wet with sweat and probably blood. I clenched my fists, digging my nails into my palms. With great effort, I forced myself to relax my hands. The tingle from the change in blood circulation made them hurt. I ignored it.

"Haley, I'm sorry." I put on my 'good guy' voice. I don't usually take this pansy-arse out to play. I wanted to kick my own ass. *Embarrassing.* "Please, let me out. We'll figure this out together? Are you hungry? I know how to score us some food." My stomach rumbled at the thought, despite my rising gorge from the cell's stench of shit, puke and rot. Time to get the hell out of here.

"Thank you, Eddie. Apology accepted. Was that so hard?" I bit my tongue. More blood. She then stood up, now coated in syrupy red. She approached the door and did pretty much what I expected. Pull, push, pull, push, pull, push. Pull. Twist right, left, right, left, right, left. Twist right. Push, pull, push, pull, push, pull. Push.

*Man, this was killing me.* "Okay, Haley, open the door." Turn, turn, turn. Open. I was free. Cool air rushed in from the hallway, and I enjoyed the freshness of it.

Haley stood a couple paces away, afraid of me. Good. She should be. "Haley, would you be so kind as to undo these buckles?" I made my best 'good guy' smile. Oscar worthy. I turned my back to her and she crept forward. Her little fingers trembled as she fiddled with the straps. It took forever!

I shook her and the jacket off. It fell to the floor with a thud and clang. Too loud. I pinwheeled my arms to bring them back to life. They felt extremely light, but strong. "Two or three days?"

"Only two days, Eddie," she said. "I saw it on Doctor Goodwin's watch. I took it from her. It's pretty. She let me play with it once." Haley jingled it on her wrist for me to see. It was too big for her. My annoyance heated up. Bye-bye, 'good guy'.

I pivoted on my heels and reached her in one step. She yelped like a wounded puppy when I grabbed her by the hair and pulled her face closer to mine, forcing her to stand on her tiptoes. That was fine with me. I held her in place for a three-count and then let her go. She nearly fell, but managed to keep her footing.

"Haley, now you listen to me. I'm nuts, but you're crazy. If you weren't a kid, I'd drop you like a sack of moldy potatoes. If you want to live, you best heel and keep up." I softened my tone, point made. I said, "You hungry? Let's hit the staff lunchroom first. Stay on your guard. The bastards could be anywhere."

She nodded. "Yes, Eddie." *Good girl*.

It wasn't supposed to be a terribly complicated affair to find us some grub. *Ha!* I turned to Haley. "You ready?"

She nodded and eked out "Y-yes, Eddie." The girl skittered around me, a couple paces away, lest I grab her by the scruff again. Hey, whatever kept her on her toes.

"We gotta get out of this block and to the stairwell on the other side of the common room. Let's go. Stay behind me." Like a beaten dog, she complied.

Unable to see, the dark hallway left me feeling exposed. The waxed tile floor glowed with the ambient light from the high windows. Without the hum of machinery, I was conscious of the sound of our progress. Our breathing. Our shuffling. The wet, slurping noise as we hit an area slick with bodily fluids and other sticky bits. We came across four bodies between Marky's cell and the monitoring station. Well, there were four separate heaps. Everything was torn and ripped apart. One pile contained too many arms and another had too few heads. Haley kept trying to identify them.

"That one is Grace. She was nice. And that one was Elias. He always touched himself down there when I saw him. Gross. Here is Paula… mixed with Charles. Some of him anyway."

"Haley," I hissed.

"Yes, Eddie?" she sounded almost chipper. *What the fuck?*

"Haley, shut the hell up before I punch you."

"Okay," she sang. If we weren't already in a nuthouse, I'd swear she was losing her marbles. Can you do that twice? I shook my head. *Focus, Eddie. Food. That's all you need. Fix you right up.*

We came close to the common room door, and I counted another six corpse-piles. Thanks, Haley. At least her naming ritual was done. The room ahead shone brighter because of a skylight, but I couldn't see inside as the glass was smeared with red and black. What I did make out would have made me shit my pants if I'd been well-fed. It was a good thing Haley slinked behind me, because the last thing we needed was a scream-fest. A shadow moved around in the common room.

"Turn around and keep an eye behind us while I scope this door."

"Eddie, I hear something." Haley squinted into the murk behind us. "There's something coming. Hurry!"

I heard the scrape of frantic movement. Something was coming for sure. A low growling swelled from Heap Number Four.  A grunt and then some movement. Haley wailed "No, no, no, no, no…"

My hands still ached from the restraints, causing me to fumble with the latch of the door handle. A heat, red and furious, formed behind my eyes as the adrenaline surged forward. I balled my left hand into a fist and smashed it down on top of the latch as I yanked with my right.  The door wouldn't budge. The palm of my left hand did little to cushion the blow. My whole arm registered the pain. The predatory sounds behind us grew louder. There was more than one. *Oh Fuck.*

Terrified and useless, Haley frantically pawed at my back. The rage part of me wanted to lash out at her, to throw her to the dark. I fought the urge. It was too short-sighted. I brought my left arm around again on the stuck latch. It finally gave way. The door opened explosively with the force of my yank. Haley and I fell backwards on the floor, closer to the advancing, and hungry, threat.

The light from the common room spilled down the hallway, lighting it up like a flare. There were nine distinct movements. Nine ways to die. Their growls got louder, becoming screams as they reacted to the light. Three retreated from the brightness, but the other six surged forward. I grabbed Haley by the wrist, dragged her to her feet and pulled her with me as I leaped across the threshold into the open room.

Wheeling to face the maw, I yelled back to Haley, who stood dumbed by shock. "Get over here! Help me close this fucking door!" She skidded over and contributed her weight. I slammed the steel door shut and hit the emergency bolt lock as the mass of flesh and bone assaulted the now sealed door. It was savage and raw, but the sound of crushing bodies and breaking limbs were muted by the insulating reinforcement.

I took Haley's hand and together we turned to face the horrors of the common room.

An abundance of light spilled from above. The skylight of the common room exposed the brilliance of the summer sun. After the dark of the ward, my eyes issued their complaint. A dull throb grew in my forehead with the same blistering cadence as my bruised hand. I shivered with excess adrenaline even though the room warmed with the sunlight. The putrescence of decay emanated here.

To the left of the door hung Doctor Andrews. He swayed back and forth gently, casting a long shadow. His neck tilted at a queer angle. I guess that'll happen when you string yourself up to a basketball net with your own necktie. One shoe sat on the floor below him. The calf of his left leg was split open and half-eaten. Precious little remained aside from the tendons and ligaments. It looked like his bandaged right bicep had taken a bite as well. I wondered if the good doctor did some last bit of public service in removing himself from the zombie gene pool. What I didn't really get was why he moved. We were alone. Sorta.

There were close to thirty people here when shit went down. Now, bits of shredded human littered the common room floor. It looked like the worst kind of food fight at summer camp. I remember a riot back in the prison's cafeteria. Best workout ever. That was a good day. Today was not. Haley sat in the middle of the room, legs splayed, cradling the head of what looked like Emma. I didn't see the rest of her, if there even was a 'rest of her' any more. Haley sang lightly. "Pockets full of posies. Ashes, Ashes..."

"They all fall down." I don't know why I joined in. The little bitch's voice was melodic and infectious, I guess. *Second verse, same as the first!* This was too much. I stepped over Barry. At least I thought it was him. Bloody blubber, puke and shit. Check, check and check! I caught myself from falling. *Christ on a cracker, this floor was greasy!* I crouched in front of Haley. "Quit the fucking singing." I spoke slowly. She stopped immediately.

That worked for about a second-and-a-half. Still playing rock-a-bye with Emma, a low moan rose from her. It grew louder and louder as her young emotions boiled over. *What the Hell*? We didn't have time for this. I grabbed Haley by the shoulders, probably a little rougher than intended. I wasn't known to be a gentle soul. "Haley, you need to stop." She didn't. I looked back at the door we came through. The banging and clawing stopped.  "Look at me, for fuck's sake." Nothing but that god-awful wailing.

I stood up and walked around her, running dirty fingers through dirty hair. My hands balled up into fists as the girl continued. I snapped around and let my backhand fly to shut her up. It wasn't until after she'd flown backwards that I registered I'd hit her with an open hand. Emma's head wobbled out of sight behind an overturned table.

I closed my eyes and lifted my head to the ceiling and muttered, "Oh, fuck." I approached Haley who flinched away from me. Rightfully so. At least she stopped with the noise. "Haley, I won't hit you again." I lied, of course. How was I to know that? I held out three fingers. "Haley, how many fingers do you see? Count them."

She looked up warily, the dark expression of her eyes partially hidden by wayward hair. She brushed it away from her face and focused on my hand, the one that struck her, now held aloft. "One, two, three. Three fingers, Eddie. Please don't hit me, Eddie. I'll be good. I'll be quiet."

"You'll be safe with me, Haley. But you gotta buck up. Can you do this?" I asked, summoning my good-guy persona again.

"That's what Mom used to say," she said quietly. I knew from group her mother was recently pushing up daisies. At this little girl's hand, no less. That's why she vacationed here with us. It's good to keep track of these things. It's good to remember the little details. I'd have to be more careful. No channelling 'Mommy Dearest' with this one. No siree, Bob.

Haley's eyes widened as they darted from meeting my gaze to over my shoulder. "Eddie…" she gasped. *Shit*.

The force of the blow sent me tumbling on top of Haley, in a tangled mass of arms and legs. My feet kept slipping on the greasy floor, failing to find purchase. The weight of our attacker fell upon us. I kept my limbs moving in an attempt to avoid being bit. All I pictured was fucknuts hanging over there with bits missing. *Not this cat. Nope. Time to get my head in the game.*

My arms found solid floor and I threw my body backwards. All I smelled was rot, strong enough to taste. Haley screamed, and so did the stinky fuck behind me. It sounded female. I managed to turn in to a crouch before it leaped at me.

I grabbed the first thing I found. *Batter up!* Barry's leg felt heavy at the meatier end as I swung. Bits of flesh and blood splattered me as it made contact with the zombie bitch's face. It didn't slow her down, so I swung again. Crack. The leg broke, bending across her head. I tossed the shattered limb aside. Even in death, Barry was a useless tit.

Haley suddenly jumped on the larger woman's back, repeatedly jabbing her head with a shard of broken glass. *Crazy bitch.* It howled in fury, trying to figure out how to deal with the unfriendly backpack.

A second undead bastard joined the fray and plucked Haley off. She turned around and cut it across the jugular, spraying putrid blood all over her face. He dropped her. Haley scurried over to where I squatted. She helped me wrench a metal leg from the upturned table.

We stood for a moment, squared off with the two monstrosities. I held my new bludgeon and Haley wielded her glass sabre. Her hands trembled as they gripped the blood-soaked cloth wrapping the makeshift hilt. Two more walking shitbags joined from the east entrance of the common room. *Damn.*

I looked at Haley. "You ready for this? This is where you shine. Pretend these ugly-ass losers are your mom. Don't stop until they do."

Haley's eyes flashed a hurtful fury at the mention of her mother. Point made. Motivation. Then she did something I didn't expect. She smiled. Widely. This kid definitely had a streak in her. For a split second, I wasn't clear who was going to get the business end of her intent. She wasn't either.

She nodded to the gruesome foursome, as they fanned out. Any theory I harbored of these being stupid movie-zombies went out the window. This would be a dance of tactics, guile and luck.

"Let's do this, Eddie. I'll head left, you right. Race ya to the middle," Haley whispered, excited and light.

I nodded slowly. She enjoyed this. My gut feelings about this little girl were on the mark.

Charging forward, we screamed like banshees.
