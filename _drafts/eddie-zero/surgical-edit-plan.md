I'd mistaken terror for weakness. 'You taught me that, Eddie. You and Barney. So thanks. But the gun stays with me.' I had no idea if I should be proud or terrified."

**INSERT**: "The helicopter sat fifty yards away, rotors still spinning. Black ops. Not hospital evac—something else. Men in hazmat suits moved around the roof perimeter."
**ADDS**: 30 words  
**PURPOSE**: Explains who they are, why they're here, sets up ambiguity

### REPLACE 7B: Entire ending sequence ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**LOCATION**: From "Barney's hand hit my chest" to final line
**CURRENT**: 4 sentences ending with "We'd be okay" (summary)
**REPLACE WITH**: Full ending (see detailed text below)
**REPLACES**: 53 words with 280 words

- Resonates with opening moral ambiguity
- Leaves room for "Haley's War" without forcing it

**NEW ENDING TEXT**:

```
Barney's hand hit my chest. He looked at me, warrior to warrior. "I'll do it." He showed his wounded arm. "My goose is cooked anyway."

I held his stare, then handed him the lighter.

Before ducking back inside, Barney said one last thing. "You need each other."

---

The helicopter lifted. Through the open door, I watched the building bloom orange, then white. The shockwave hit us—warm wind and burning propane. Haley gripped my hand.

Below, the research facility collapsed into itself, taking its infected and its secrets down together. Whatever they'd been working on, whatever had jumped from chimp to human, it was burning now. Maybe that was enough. Maybe it wasn't.

I looked at Haley. She watched the fire with the same expression she'd worn in the common room—part wonder, part satisfaction. We were soaked in blood, bandaged, exhausted. Her hand in mine was cold but steady.

She met my eyes. "You think we're the good guys, Eddie?"

I thought about Meier, the patients who didn't make it, Barney choosing his own end. About this damaged kid who'd survived Hell by becoming someone who could live in it. About what I'd done to get here.

"No," I said. "But we're alive."

The helicopter banked east, away from the burning hospital. The fire behind us lit up the night sky like a second sun. Haley leaned against my shoulder and closed her eyes.

I watched the flames shrink to an orange glow on the horizon. The men in hazmat suits watched us. One spoke into a radio. I didn't care anymore.

We'd earned this moment. Whatever came next, we'd face it like we'd faced everything else—together, damaged, dangerous.

The fire disappeared behind clouds.

We flew into the dark.
```

## Key Execution Notes

### Voice Preservation
- Keep Eddie's dark humor ("Christ on a cracker," "Not this cat")
- Maintain staccato internal thoughts (*italics*)
- Preserve "good guy persona" references
- Don't smooth out his rough edges

### Rhythm Management
- Mix sentence lengths (avoid staccato in non-action)
- Use fragments for impact, not efficiency
- Preserve breathing moments (nurse station, post-combat)
- Keep action sequences kinetic

### Character Integrity
- Eddie: Violent but not sadistic, cynical but not cruel
- Haley: Damaged but not broken, dangerous but not evil
- Barney: Competent but not superhuman, resigned but not defeated

### What NOT To Do
- Don't add strategic planning
- Don't make discoveries deliberate
- Don't explain zombie rules
- Don't add exposition about outbreak
- Don't soften the violence
- Don't force Haley's War connection
