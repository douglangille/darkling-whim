## Workflow History

### Session 1 - December 29, 2025
- Loaded ASSESSMENT-BOOTSTRAP.md
- Completed full assessment (Phases 1-3)
- **Recommendation**: EXPAND to 3,200 words
- **Rationale**: Story has powerful thematic core cramped by current scope. Key emotional moments (transformation, abandonment) need to be shown, not told.
- Created project folder structure
- Ready to begin EXPANSION workflow

## Story Summary

A dragon-slaying knight must choose between his destined marriage to a princess and his dragon-transformed true love who crashes his wedding to demand honesty.

**Thematic Core**: The violence of conformity. The wedding itself is the monster—a ritualized binding that requires Rodney to kill part of himself to fit society's expectations.

**Key Insight**: Rodney is reactive and cowardly; Maud is proactive and desperate. This dynamic must be preserved in expansion.

---

## Expansion Plan

**Target Structure**: 3-4 scenes with strategic flashbacks

### Preserve (Sacred Core)
1. Wedding disruption opening (in medias res)
2. Rodney's reactive/cowardly nature
3. Maud as the driver of confrontation
4. Thematic core: wedding as monster
5. Lavender detail and other perfect sensory moments
6. Dialogue subtext

### Add (Major Additions)
1. **Flashback: The Transformation** (~400-500 words) - Show Maud touching the crystal
2. **Flashback: The Abandonment** (~300-400 words) - Show Rodney leaving
3. **Gwen's Agency** (~200-300 words) - Give her a voice
4. **The Choice Shown** (~200 words) - Action not announcement
5. **Brief Aftermath** (~300-400 words) - First consequence of choice

### Cut/Tighten
- Opening line "She's a smoke show"
- Larry's clunky exposition
- Repetitive accusations from Maud
- Over-explanatory dialogue

**Estimated Final Length**: ~3,200 words
