## Story Summary

A father drives his daughter to soccer practice while playing "Eye Spy," even as intrusive memories of his mistress Jenny's death and approaching police consequences fracture his grip on reality. The story uses fragmented structure and the innocent children's game to create psychological horror through implication and dissociation.

## Core Strengths

- Eye Spy game as structural device
- Fragmented narrative mirroring dissociation
- Rabbit-skinning metaphor
- Economy of revelation
- Perfect compression for flash fiction
- Implication over explanation

## Revision Goals

- Add one genuine breakdown moment in present timeline
- Strengthen "my hands hurt" rhythm (three beats)
- Make final line less controlled
- Sharpen death scene description
- Physicalize emotions more
- Trust silence and implication even more
