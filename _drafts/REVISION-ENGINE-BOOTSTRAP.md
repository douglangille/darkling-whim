# ⚠️ DEPRECATED - Use Story Engine Instead

This bootstrap has been superseded by the **Story Engine** modular system.

---

## What Changed?

The revision workflow is now part of a larger **Story Engine** that handles all phases of storytelling:

- ✅ **ASSESSMENT** - Analyze existing work and determine path forward
- ✅ **REVISION** - Polish work at current scope
- ✅ **EXPANSION** - Grow work to larger scope  
- ✅ **DRAFTING** - Build complete drafts from concepts
- ✅ **IDEATION** - Develop story concepts
- And more...

## Quick Migration Guide

### For Existing Revision Projects (like Mitzy)

Your work is safe! The `_drafts/mitzy-revision/` folder and all its files are unchanged.

**To continue an existing revision:**

```
Connect to my Workbench repo on GitHub.

Load and follow story-engine/bootstraps/REVISION-BOOTSTRAP.md

# Revising: Mitzy and the Butterfly
Load artifacts: _drafts/mitzy-revision/
Report status and resume.
```

### For New Published Story Work

**Start with assessment** to determine if you should revise or expand:

```
Connect to my Workbench repo on GitHub.

Load and follow story-engine/bootstraps/ASSESSMENT-BOOTSTRAP.md

# Assess: [Story Title]
Original: _posts/[filename].md
Analyze and recommend path forward.
```

- EXPANSION-BOOTSTRAP.md

- IDEATION-BOOTSTRAP.md
- [More to come]

## Why the Change?

The original revision system assumed you always wanted to polish at current scope. 

The Story Engine recognizes that sometimes:
- Flash fiction wants to become a short story
- A vignette has expansion potential
- You need assessment before committing to a path
- You're working on new drafts, not just revisions

The modular bootstrap system handles all these scenarios.

## Need Help?

Read the Story Engine README:
```
Connect to my Workbench repo on GitHub.
Load and follow story-engine/README.md
```

It explains the complete system and decision tree for which bootstrap to use.
