# Cowboy Games - Expansion Project

**Original Publication**: March 20, 2014  
**Original Word Count**: 602 words  
**Original Scope**: Flash fiction  

**Expansion Goal**: Minimal expansion to 800-900 words (staying in flash fiction)  
**Expansion Factor**: 1.4x  
**Expansion Date**: December 29, 2025

## Project Overview

"Cowboy Games" is a flash fiction piece about two elderly care home residents who find unexpected connection on a night when one contemplates suicide. The expansion adds character depth and emotional weight while preserving the core story's compression and power.

## Workflow Status

- [x] Assessment complete
- [x] Foundation documented
- [ ] Scene briefs created
- [ ] New scenes drafted
- [ ] Integration complete
- [ ] Polish pass
- [ ] Publication ready

## Key Preservation Requirements

**CRITICAL**: The accidental timing of Jameson's knock must be preserved. This cannot become a deliberate intervention. The story's power depends on serendipity.

**Voice**: Matter-of-fact narration, compression, implication over explanation

**Core scenes**: Opening paragraph, "wall sconce" line, final line - all preserved exactly

## Expansion Strategy

Adding 4 new beats (~250 words total):
1. Eileen's teaching memory (50-75 words)
2. Deeper suicide contemplation (50-75 words)
3. Jameson preparation scene (50-100 words)
4. Door hesitation beat (50-75 words) - THE CRITICAL ADDITION
