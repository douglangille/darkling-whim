## Story Synopsis

A young girl named Mitzy wakes in the center of an overgrown boxwood maze after her little sister June has disappeared through "white magic." Guided by Larry, a talking black butterfly, Mitzy arms herself with an iron spear and navigates the maze under a one-hour deadline to find and kill the Goblin who has taken June. Mitzy harbors resentment toward June, calling her "Fake June" and remembering being happier before she arrived. At the climax, Mitzy finds her target and thrusts her spear into its belly—only to discover she has killed June herself. The story frames this tragedy with the repeated line: "White magic. My little sister. Gone."

## Themes & Motifs

### PRIMARY THEMES

**1. Resentment and Its Consequences**
- Mitzy's jealousy of June
- "We were happy before she came along"
- Resentment blinds her to reality
- Gets what she thinks she wants (June gone)
- Destroys what she actually loves

**2. Self-Fulfilling Prophecy**
- Mitzy believes June is "fake"
- Acts on that belief
- Makes it "true" by killing her
- The prophecy/fear creates the outcome

**3. Family Dysfunction**
- Replacement children
- Sibling rivalry taken to extreme
- Parents absent (literally and figuratively)
- Love twisted into violence

**4. The Danger of Stories We Tell Ourselves**
- "Fake June" is Mitzy's narrative
- She believes her own story
- The story controls her actions
- Reality contradicts the story too late

**5. Lost Innocence**
- Children in deadly circumstances
- Corruption of fairy tale elements
- Murder of innocence (literal and metaphorical)
- Cannot return to pre-maze state

### SECONDARY THEMES

**Manipulation**: Larry guides Mitzy to tragedy
**Isolation**: Mitzy is alone with her thoughts
**Choice vs. Fate**: Was this inevitable?
**Trust**: Who can be trusted in the maze?
**Identity**: Who is real? Who is fake?

### MOTIFS

**White Magic**: Frames the story, agent of transformation/loss

**The Maze**: Classic symbol of confusion, journey, trial

**Time**: One hour limit, midday sun, time warping

**Eyes Open/Closed**: Mitzy closes eyes to strike, opens to truth

**Names**: Mitzy, June, Larry—familiar, ordinary names in extraordinary circumstances

**The Butterfly**: Transformation symbol (ironic—Mitzy transforms into killer)

**Iron**: Cold, hard, deadly—opposite of the organic maze

**Ivy**: Clinging, invasive plant design on weapon

**Breathing**: The Goblin's breath, Mitzy's sweat, physical reality amid unreality

**Sisters**: "Little sister," "sissy," "sister"—repetition emphasizes relationship

### SYMBOLS

**The Boxwood Maze**: 
- Psychological confusion
- Family dysfunction as trap
- No clear exit
- Created/imposed structure

**The Iron Ivy Spear**:
- Mitzy's agency
- Violence as solution
- Nature corrupted (ivy) + industry (iron)
- Phallic weapon (penetration, violation)

**Larry the Butterfly**:
- Transformation
- Ephemeral guidance
- Trickster/tempter figure
- Dark mirror of innocence

**The Sign**:
- Rules Mitzy can't read
- Authority she doesn't understand
- Literacy as power/powerlessness

**The Hour**:
- Deadline
- Pressure
- Fate/inevitability
- Midday as appointed time

**The Center Ring**:
- Starting point
- Moment of choice
- Circular journey returning to same truth

Expansion would fulfill the story's potential rather than padding it. The question isn't whether it CAN be expanded, but whether it SHOULD be—and the answer depends on the author's goals, available time, and creative energy.

All the tools for expansion are here. The foundation is sound. The decision now is whether to build on it.
