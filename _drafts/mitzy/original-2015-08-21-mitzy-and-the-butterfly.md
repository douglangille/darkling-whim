*Mitzy crouched by the stream, her hands trembling as she cupped the cool water. The butterfly settled on a nearby stone, its wings catching fragments of impossible light.*

"I'm sorry," she whispered to it. "I'm so sorry."

*The Maze had rules. She knew them all now.*

## The Beginning

Mitzy's brother June had disappeared three days ago. Not unusual for him—he'd always been the wandering type, drawn to edges and borders and places where the world grew thin. But this time felt different. This time, Mama's worry lines had deepened to crevasses, and even Papa had stopped pretending everything was fine.

"The Goblin took him," Mitzy told them. "Into the Maze."

Mama's face went white. Papa gripped the table edge.

"You can't know that," Papa said.

"I saw it. Through the kitchen window. June was by the woods, and the Goblin came out of nowhere—just *was* there, like he'd always been there but we couldn't see until he wanted us to. He touched June's shoulder and they walked into the trees together."

"Why didn't you call us?" Mama's voice broke.

*Because June looked happy*, Mitzy didn't say. *Because he went willingly.*

"I'll bring him back," she said instead.

## The Maze

The Maze existed in the space between intention and accident, between the woods behind their house and somewhere else entirely. To enter, you simply had to want something badly enough and be willing to pay for it.

Mitzy wanted June back. She'd pay anything.

The entrance appeared as a gap between two oak trees—a gap that hadn't been there before and wouldn't be there again. The Goblin waited just inside, patient as stone, old as bargains.

"Mitzy," he said, her name like rust in his mouth. "I wondered when you'd come."

"I want my brother."

"Naturally. And what will you offer?"

*Everything. Anything.*

"My voice," she said. The Maze liked symbols, liked sacrifices that *meant* something. Mitzy sang in the church choir, and her voice was the only thing she had that felt like hers alone.

The Goblin smiled, showing too many teeth. "Your voice for your brother's freedom. Done."

Her throat burned for just a moment, then went numb. When she tried to speak, nothing came out.

"The Maze is easy," the Goblin said. "Follow the water upstream. When you find him, bring him home. Simple."

Nothing in the Maze was ever simple.

## The Journey

The stream flowed backwards, upstream leading deeper into the Maze's heart. Mitzy followed it through forests that were and weren't the woods behind her house, past clearings where the sky showed stars she'd never seen, across bridges made of moonlight and bad intentions.

She met others on the path:

A woman carrying a basket of stones. "I'm looking for my daughter," she wrote in the dirt, voiceless like Mitzy. "Have you seen her?"

Mitzy shook her head.

"I've been looking for three years," the woman wrote. "She's probably grown by now. Probably doesn't remember me."

Mitzy moved on.

A boy no older than eight, sitting by the water. "I lost my shadow," he said. "The Goblin promised to help me find it, but I can't remember which way I came from."

Mitzy pointed upstream.

"Thank you," he said. "I miss my shadow. I miss casting it."

She understood. She missed her voice already, missed the weight of words on her tongue.

## The Finding

June sat on a stone at the stream's source, where water bubbled up from nowhere, from nothing, from the Maze's dreaming heart. A butterfly with wings like stained glass circled his head, landing on his shoulder, his knee, his open palm.

He looked peaceful. Happy, even.

"Mitzy," he said, seeing her. "You shouldn't have come."

She tried to speak, to ask him why, to ask him how, to ask him *please come home*. Nothing emerged but silence.

"The Goblin told me you'd come," June continued. "He said you'd give up something precious to find me. I told him not to make the bargain, but..." He shrugged. "The Maze likes its patterns."

The butterfly landed on Mitzy's shoulder. Up close, she could see things in its wings—memories, moments, little pieces of brother and sister together: June teaching her to skip stones, Mitzy braiding his hair for a school play, both of them laughing at Papa's terrible jokes, fighting over the last cookie, making up, fighting again.

June watched her see it all.

"I didn't want to come home," he said quietly. "I never wanted what they wanted for me—the college, the job, the life all planned out like a straight road with no turns. The Maze offered something else. Freedom. Possibility. The chance to be *more* than what I was supposed to be."

Mitzy reached for him, grabbed his wrist.

"I can't go back," he said. "And you can't make me."

But she'd made a bargain. Her voice for his freedom. The Goblin's words were careful—his *freedom*, not his return. She understood now. June was already free. She'd given up her voice for nothing, for a freedom he already possessed.

She let go of his wrist.

The butterfly flew from her shoulder, circled once, twice, then landed on June's chest, right over his heart. Its wings pulsed once, twice, then stilled.

June gasped. Looked down. Looked at her.

"Mitzy? What did you—"

But she was already running, back down the stream, back through the Maze, back to the entrance where the Goblin waited with his patient smile.

*You can't have him*, she thought at him. *I won't let you.*

The Goblin's smile widened. "The bargain is complete. You freed him. He can never be held by the Maze now. Not ever. You gave him the greatest gift—permanent freedom from ever being bound again."

She stumbled through the gap between trees, back into the woods, back to the world where Mama and Papa waited and worried and hoped.

But June didn't follow.

He would never follow.

## The Truth

Mitzy knelt by the stream behind the house—the real stream, not the Maze's mockery—and cried without sound. The butterfly from the Maze had followed her home somehow, had slipped between worlds to settle on the stone beside her.

She'd thought she was saving June.

But the Goblin had told the truth: she'd freed him. Freed him from ever having to come home, from ever having to choose between the Maze and the world, from ever having to be anything other than what he wanted to be.

She'd given him permission to stay lost.

And she'd done it knowing, in some dark corner of her heart, that Mama and Papa loved June more. That they worried about him more. That when he was gone, there was space for her that had never existed before.

The butterfly's wings pulsed with memories, with all the moments of jealousy she'd never admitted, all the times she'd wished June would just disappear, just leave, just give her room to breathe in their parents' love.

The Maze had given her what she wanted.

And June had gotten what he wanted.

And Mama and Papa would spend the rest of their lives wondering, hoping, grieving.

Mitzy touched the butterfly's wing. It felt like guilt. Like choice. Like the price you pay when you get exactly what you wish for.

"I'm sorry," she whispered, voiceless. "I'm so sorry."

The butterfly flew away, carrying her voice, her brother, her innocence into the growing dark.

And Mitzy went home to tell her parents that June was gone, truly gone, and that it was all her fault.
