# Revision Notes: Shardik

---

## Session: December 29, 2025 - Planning Complete

**Phase**: Phase 2 - Planning (COMPLETE)
**Goal**: Develop complete, approved revision plan
**Status**: Author has approved Option C for final line, ready to proceed to execution

### Planning Complete

**Artifacts Created**:
- README.md (project overview and status)
- original-shardik.md (frozen copy of published version)
- assessment.md (complete dual analysis)
- dossier.md (comprehensive story analysis)
- critique.md (literary evaluation with ratings)
- revision-plan.md (detailed, surgical plan)
- revision-notes.md (this file)

### Author Decisions Made

1. **Final Line**: Option C approved (pattern callback)
2. **Transformation Beat**: Author to choose fuller or terser version in execution
3. **Tommy Dialogue**: Author to choose Option A, B, or keep as-is in execution  
4. **Temperature Setup**: Author to decide include or skip in execution

### Revision Priorities Confirmed

**MUST FIX**:
- Transformation beat (add concrete detail)
- Final line (implement Option C)

**SHOULD FIX**:
- Tommy dialogue (drop "Little" or revise)

**COULD ADD**:
- Temperature setup (establish heat for contrast)

### Estimated Scope

**Word Count Impact**: +1 to +24 words (recommend +1, staying at 751)
**Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes for execution  
**Sessions**: 1 session for execution, integration will be quick (single scene)
**Risk Level**: LOW - surgical changes with clear rationale

### Next Steps

**For Next Session**:
1. Load REVISION-BOOTSTRAP.md
2. Load revision-plan.md
3. Begin Phase 3: Execution
4. Create working-shardik.md
5. Implement approved changes
6. Author makes final decisions on optional elements during execution

### Open Questions for Execution

1. Transformation beat: Fuller version (15 words) or terser (8 words)?
2. Tommy dialogue: Option A (drop "Little"), Option B (character voice), or keep as-is?
3. Temperature setup: Include (6-9 words) or skip?

**Recommendation**: Terser transformation (+8), drop "Little" (-1), skip temperature = net +1 word, maximum impact with minimal intervention.
