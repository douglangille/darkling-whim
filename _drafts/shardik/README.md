## Revision Goals

**Primary Goal**: Strengthen the one weak joint in the story - make Cheryl's psychological transformation feel fully earned through concrete detail.

**Secondary Goals**:
- Replace final line with Option C (pattern callback ending)
- Minor polish to Tommy's dialogue
- Optional: Add sensory setup for temperature contrast

**Must Preserve**:
- Flash fiction scope (~750 words, minimal change)
- Surgical precision and haunting ambiguity
- The mystery of what "daughter" means
- Shardik's intelligence and patience
- The visceral horror balanced with cosmic implications
- The voice and pacing

## Key Decisions

**Ending Choice**: Option C - Pattern callback ending  
**Rationale**: Connects to earlier hunter thread, confirms pattern without explaining, preserves mystery, more literary and subtle.

**Scope Approach**: Minimal changes, maximum impact  
**Estimated Impact**: +/- 20 words maximum

---

## Assessment Summary

**Core Strength**: Near-perfect folk horror flash fiction. Compression, ambiguity, and mythological implications are features, not bugs.

**Primary Weakness**: One weak joint where psychological transformation needs one more concrete detail to feel fully earned.

**Path**: REVISION with surgical precision (1-2 sessions), then complete.
