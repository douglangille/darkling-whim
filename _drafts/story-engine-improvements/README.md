# Story Engine Improvements Meta-Project

**Project Type:** System Enhancement  
**Status:** Planning Phase  
**Started:** January 15, 2026  
**Source Material:** Meta-analysis of "Calum in the Forest" workflow (ChatGPT ideation → Claude drafting → publishing)

## Project Overview

This meta-project tracks systematic improvements to the Story Engine based on real-world workflow analysis. The goal is to integrate lessons learned from the "Calum in the Forest" flash fiction project into the bootstrap files, documentation, and custom instructions.

## Key Insights from Meta-Analysis

### What Worked
- Structured constraint progression (broad → filtered → specific) for ideation
- Role-based critique (literary critic + genre fan) for pattern recognition
- Platform switching at natural inflection points
- Iterative refinement with explicit evaluation criteria (rubrics)
- "Remove guardrails" approach for second drafts
- Human authority on voice, AI handling structure/mechanics

### What Didn't Work
- Word-count constraints per paragraph (suffocated prose flow)
- Over-specification that prevented natural rhythm
- Single-pass approaches without refinement opportunity

### Process Innovations
- **"Remove Guardrails" Prompt:** Explicitly authorize messier, more visceral prose
- **Second-Read Analysis:** AI identifies foreshadowing and thematic integration
- **Surgical Voice Edits:** Human final pass for distinctive voice and rhythm
- **Escalation Beat Markers:** Replace word counts with tension progression points

## Revision Scope

### Bootstrap Files Requiring Updates
1. IDEATION-BOOTSTRAP.md
2. DRAFTING-BOOTSTRAP.md
3. REVISION-BOOTSTRAP.md
4. BLOG-POST-BOOTSTRAP.md (publishing workflow)

### Core Documentation
1. story-engine/README.md
2. story-engine/CUSTOM-INSTRUCTIONS.txt
3. story-engine/CONTEXT-STRATEGY.md (if applicable)

### New Resources to Create
1. FLASH-FICTION-WORKFLOW.md (dedicated guide)
2. PROMPT-PATTERNS.md (reusable strategies like "remove guardrails")
3. CRITIQUE-FRAMEWORK.md (role-based analysis templates)

## Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Documentation (Current)**
- Create revision plan
- Document meta-analysis
- Establish project tracking

**Phase 2: Bootstrap Revisions**
- Update IDEATION with rubric-based approach
- Update DRAFTING with constraint-removal patterns
- Update REVISION with dual-perspective critique
- Update BLOG-POST with teaser/visual asset workflow

**Phase 3: New Resources**
- Create FLASH-FICTION-WORKFLOW.md
- Create PROMPT-PATTERNS.md
- Create CRITIQUE-FRAMEWORK.md

**Phase 4: Integration Testing**
- Test revised bootstraps with new project
- Validate improvements against original pain points
- Iterate based on real-world usage

## Project Files

- `meta-analysis-source.md` - Original meta-analysis from __inbox
- `revision-plan.md` - Detailed revision plan for all files
- `README.md` - This file

## Next Actions

1. Review and approve revision plan
2. Begin systematic bootstrap file updates
3. Commit updates incrementally with clear change documentation
4. Test revised workflows with upcoming projects
