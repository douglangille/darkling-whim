## Scene Chain Validation

✅ Scene 1 (Disaster: sloppy escape) → Scene 2 (Reaction: frustration)  
✅ Scene 2 (Decision: vacation) → Scene 3 (Reaction: decompression)  
✅ Scene 3 (Decision: trust process) → Scene 4 (Goal: enjoy distraction)  
✅ Scene 4 (Disaster: "my city" slip) → Scene 5 (Peak: realization)  
✅ Scene 5 (Peak: unmasking) → Scene 6 (Reaction: triumph)  
✅ Scene 6 (Decision: begin long game) → [End with future implications]

## Next Steps
1. Create detailed atomic briefs for Scenes 1 and 2 (entirely new)
2. Create expansion briefs for Scenes 3, 4, and 6 (showing integration points)
3. Make authorship decisions (Human vs. AI First Draft)
4. Get author approval before drafting
