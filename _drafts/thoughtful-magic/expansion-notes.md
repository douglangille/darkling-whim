## Save Point: 2025-12-29 18:30 AST (FINAL SESSION SAVE)

**Phase**: Phase 2: STRUCTURE PLANNING (Complete)

**Progress**: 
- ✅ Foundation REVISED to Option A (character study, accidental discovery preserved)
- ✅ Corrected structural error: removed "heist objective" that conflicted with original's serendipity
- ✅ Scene sequence refined to demonstrate superpower across entire story
- ✅ Scene 6 enhanced with concrete strategic action (anonymous informant first message)
- ✅ Scene tracker updated with new word count distribution
- ✅ Validated scene chain (Goal-Conflict-Disaster / Reaction-Dilemma-Decision flow)
- ✅ Series ideas archived and organized:
  - `series-ideas.md` - The Long Game (5 novellas) with integrated "Rule She Won't Break"
  - `series-ideas-philosophical.md` - Additional character study concepts
- ✅ All planning documents committed to GitHub

**Last Completed**: Full planning phase with enhanced ending strategy and series framework.

**Next Steps**: 
1. Load `story-engine/bootstraps/EXPANSION-BOOTSTRAP.md`
2. Load `story-engine/bootstraps/SCENE-WORKFLOW.md`
3. Review `_drafts/thoughtful-magic/expansion-plan.md`
4. Create detailed atomic brief for Scene 1 (The City Escape)
5. Create detailed atomic brief for Scene 2 (The Lair Arrival)
6. Create integration briefs for Scenes 3, 4, and 6
7. Make authorship decisions for each new/expanded scene
8. Get author approval before drafting any prose

**Voice Check**: N/A (Prose drafting not yet started).

**Integration Notes**: 
- Scene 5 (The Realization) will be preserved EXACTLY as anchor point
- Expansion material must match original's campy-smart tone
- Stacey dialogue needs to contrast with Amy's style (literal vs. intuitive)
- Scene 6 now includes Amy's first anonymous message to Tim

**Open Questions**: 
- What specific heist object in Scene 1? (Suggested: Atlas Chronometer - family legacy item)
- How much of the "awkward courtship" history to reveal in Scene 4?
- Does Scene 6 message need refinement or is current version good?

**Key Insights from This Session**:

1. **Structural Fix**: The original's magic is serendipitous discovery, not planned heist. Amy's superpower works even when she's NOT trying to use it. Expansion demonstrates this principle across whole story.

2. **Ending Enhancement**: Scene 6 now shows concrete first move (anonymous tip to Tim) rather than abstract "we'll plan." This demonstrates "thoughtful magic" immediately and creates natural sequel hook.

3. **Series Framework**: If story succeeds, The Long Game (5 novellas) provides clear path forward. Story 2 enhanced with "The Rule She Won't Break" to stress-test Amy's philosophy.

**Project Status**:
- **Phase 1**: Foundation Review ✅ COMPLETE
- **Phase 2**: Structure Planning ✅ COMPLETE  
- **Phase 3**: Incremental Building ⏳ READY TO BEGIN
