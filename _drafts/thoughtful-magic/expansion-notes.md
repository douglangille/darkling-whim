**Phase**: Phase 2: STRUCTURE PLANNING (Initial)
**Progress**: 
- Foundation documented in `foundation.md`
- High-level expansion strategy in `expansion-plan.md`
- Scene sequence defined in `scene-tracker.md`
- Original content identified as anchors (Scenes 4 and 6)
**Last Completed**: Established "Heist meets Character Study" plot direction.
**Next Steps**: 
1. Load `SCENE-WORKFLOW.md`.
2. Create detailed atomic briefs for Scene 1 (The City Escape) and Scene 3 (The Infiltration).
3. Confirm authorship decisions (Human vs. AI First Draft) for all new scenes.
**Voice Check**: N/A (Prose drafting not yet started).
**Integration Notes**: Strategy focuses on Amy's "deliberate" nature.
**Open Questions**: 
- What is the specific object of the heist at the Brandt estate?
- How much of Stacey's "literal-minded" humor do we want in Scene 2?

**To Resume**: Load `EXPANSION-BOOTSTRAP.md` and `SCENE-WORKFLOW.md`. Review `_drafts/thoughtful-magic/expansion-plan.md` and begin drafting Scene 1 Brief.
