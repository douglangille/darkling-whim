**Phase**: Phase 2: STRUCTURE PLANNING (Revised)

**Progress**: 
- Foundation REVISED to Option A (character study, accidental discovery preserved)
- Corrected structural error: removed "heist objective" that conflicted with original's serendipity
- Scene sequence refined to demonstrate superpower across entire story
- Scene tracker updated with new word count distribution
- Validated scene chain (Goal-Conflict-Disaster / Reaction-Dilemma-Decision flow)

**Last Completed**: Full revision of expansion strategy to preserve the story's essential magic.

**Next Steps**: 
1. Load `SCENE-WORKFLOW.md`
2. Create detailed atomic brief for Scene 1 (The City Escape)
3. Create detailed atomic brief for Scene 2 (The Lair Arrival)
4. Create integration briefs for Scenes 3, 4, and 6
5. Make authorship decisions for each new/expanded scene
6. Get author approval before drafting any prose

**Voice Check**: N/A (Prose drafting not yet started).

**Integration Notes**: 
- Scene 5 (The Realization) will be preserved EXACTLY as anchor point
- Expansion material must match original's campy-smart tone
- Stacey dialogue needs to contrast with Amy's style (literal vs. intuitive)

**Open Questions**: 
- What specific heist object in Scene 1? (Suggests: Atlas Chronometer - family legacy item)
- How much of the "awkward courtship" history to reveal in Scene 4?
- Should Scene 6 hint at a sequel or stand alone?

**Key Insight from Revision**: 
The original's magic is that Amy's superpower works even when she's NOT trying to use it. The expansion should demonstrate this principle, not turn her into Mission: Impossible. The "thoughtful magic" is who she IS, not what she DOES.

**To Resume**: 
Load `EXPANSION-BOOTSTRAP.md` and `SCENE-WORKFLOW.md`. Review revised `_drafts/thoughtful-magic/expansion-plan.md`. Begin developing Scene 1 brief (The City Escape).
