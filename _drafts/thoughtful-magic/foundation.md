## Preserve (Do Not Change)

### Core Scenes (Anchors)
1. **The "Figure of Speech" realization**: The moment Tim slips up and refers to "his city."
2. **The "Jealous Spark"**: The specific romantic tension and the physical reaction (the blush) Amy tries to banish.
3. **The Departure**: Amy sprinting barefoot through the shoals, energized by her discovery.

### Voice & Style
- **Amy's Arrogance**: Self-referential titles like 'Her Royal Badness'.
- **Campy Tech**: Fembots, sultry henchbots, and dramatic "bondage" of hair/makeup.
- **Narrative Distance**: Close 3rd person following Amy's internal "thoughtful" process.

### Character Essence
- **Amy Atlas**: Smart, deliberate, ethical-in-her-own-way, unencumbered by morality.
- **Tim Brandt**: Wolfish grin, playboy heir, hiding a hero’s vigilance under champagne.

## Expand (Development Targets)

### New Scenes Needed
1. **The City Prologue (New)**: Show Amy nearly caught by the "wisecracker" in a heist that goes south because she *wasn't* being deliberate enough.
2. **The Lair Planning (New)**: A scene with Stacey debating the "vacation" vs "operation."
3. **The Infiltration (New)**: Amy bypassing the estate's high-tech security, demonstrating her "thoughtful" superpower.

### Character Development
- **Stacey (Fembot)**: Expand her from a suggestion-bot to a sarcastic, literal-minded logic foil for Amy.
- **The Rivalry**: Establish the specific history of their "awkward courtship" through dialogue subtext.

### World-Building
- **Atlas Ethics**: Define what her "own brand of ethics" actually entails.
- **Winter-Lair Detail**: Flesh out the contrast between "mega-evil" tech and Caribbean luxury.

## Integration Strategy
