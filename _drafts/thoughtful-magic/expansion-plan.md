# Expansion Plan: Thoughtful Magic

## High-Level Strategy
The story will be restructured as a "Thoughtful Heist." Amy isn't just at the party by accident; she is there to acquire "The Brandt Ledger" (or similar asset) to neutralize her nemesis. The humor comes from the campy villain tropes, while the "smart" element comes from Amy actually being better at logic than everyone else.

## SCENE BRIEFS (Phase 2 Preview)

### Scene 1 (Action-Scene)
- **Goal**: Escape the city hero without compromising her identity.
