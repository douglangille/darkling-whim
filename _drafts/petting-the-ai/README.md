## Key Content Captured

### Section 1: Hook (Personal Stories)
1. **3 AM Mad Scientist Tournament** - Primary hook story
   - Political news → scenarios → mad scientist vs engineer question
   - Ended with 7-season reality TV series concept
   - At 3 AM in bed
   - Perfect example of "doom chatting"

2. **Named Threads & Context Frustration**
   - Long threads with names to preserve context
   - Tool forgets anyway, constant reminding
   - Frustration with the tool itself

3. **Hundreds of Undeletable Threads**
   - ChatGPT Plus subscription
   - Accumulated hundreds of threads
   - Couldn't delete - not because valuable, but felt wrong
   - Realization: "I was petting the AI"

### Section 4: Architecting Defense (Doug's ACTUAL Setup)

**Current Tech Stack**:
- Perplexity Pro (primary, annual membership Dec 2024)
- Connected to GitHub via MCP
- Notes stored in private GitHub repo (__inbox folder)

**Device Strategy**:
- REMOVED: ChatGPT app, Gemini app
- KEPT: Perplexity app (only chatbot, for Share Sheet + daily utility)
- Browser bookmarks for all chatbots "at the ready"

**Three-Step Chat Hygiene Protocol**:
1. Finish conversation
2. Harvest takeaways (paste rollup prompt)
3. Delete thread immediately

**Key Quotes**:
- "I don't want to have any emotion with the tool. It is just a tool."
- "The stupid Apple Share Sheet" (tongue twister joke)

### Section 6: Practical Checklist

**Doug's Actual Takeaway Prompt** (stored in Apple Note):
```
Read through this entire chat and provide a structured detailed summary. Then identify anything that is important enough to save to my notes. Give me those in separate markdown code blocks so I can easily copy/paste them into individual files. If you can give me them in downloadable markdown files directly, do that. If you can access my Workbench GitHub repo, commit these files to my __inbox folder.
```

**Doug's Gemini Custom Instructions**:
- No engagement-baiting follow-ups
- Drift detection interrupts
- Built-in rollup at conclusion
- Suggests thread deletion if no long-term value
- "Mostly works"

**7-Point Checklist**:
1. Turn on auto-delete (Gemini: 3-month setting)
2. Remove chatbot apps from phone (except one for Share Sheet)
3. Create takeaway extraction protocol (harvest-save-delete)
4. Set custom instructions to prevent engagement loops
5. Use browser bookmarks vs. apps (friction = intentionality)
6. Create notes landing zone (__inbox folder in GitHub)
7. Prefer transactional over conversational interaction

---

## Evidence Base Summary

**Strong Support**:
- System design vs. willpower (Thaler & Sunstein, BJ Fogg)
- Friction design (50-70% usage reduction through app removal)
- Digital hoarding patterns (loss aversion, status quo bias)
- ADHD/neurodivergent patterns (constraints > motivation)

**Research Gaps**:
- Limited peer-reviewed studies on generative AI parasocial relationships (field too new)
- Custom instructions for user behavior (emerging, not established)

**Contrary Evidence Acknowledged**:
- Multi-turn conversations DO improve reasoning tasks
- Willpower approaches work for some people
- Chatbot interaction can improve mental health
- ADHD individuals may benefit from AI body doubling

**Critical Caveats**:
1. Field is new (ChatGPT only 2 years old)
2. "Works for my brain" qualifier essential
3. Not universal prescription
4. Neurodiversity matters significantly
5. Benefits aren't denied - about access type, not tool value

## Remaining Sections to Detail

**Section 2: The Intimacy of the Phone**
- Phone as always-with-you object
- Why it encourages emotional use
- Brief research on parasociality

**Section 3: How Chat Sprawl Happens**
- One-offs, half-finished threads
- Talking to bot about everything
- Guilt of not curating vs. impossibility of doing so

**Section 5: From Willpower to System Design**
- Sustainable digital hygiene = constraints, not discipline
- Encoding intent into devices reduces emotional drift
- Action→Hope→Motivation cycle

**Section 7: Closing**
- Reframe: AI isn't pet, it's power tool
- Invite readers to design boundaries proactively
- Not waiting to feel "addicted" first

## Bootstrap Being Followed

**story-engine/bootstraps/BLOG-POST-BOOTSTRAP.md**

7 Phases:
