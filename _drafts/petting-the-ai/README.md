## Key Changes During Beta Review

### MUST Fixes Applied:
1. ✅ Replaced "Action→Hope→Motivation" jargon with clearer "system design beats willpower" language
2. ✅ Expanded emotional climax (panic at deletion) from 3 sentences to full paragraph with counseling thread story
3. ✅ Removed Perplexity app from phone (done literally while working on post) - all chatbots now browser-only

### SHOULD Fixes Applied:
1. ✅ Simplified Section 2 from 3 competing arcs to single Useful→Suffocating arc
2. ✅ Cut "everything turns to brown" confusing metaphor
3. ✅ Explained "mostly works" limitation on custom instructions
4. ✅ Consolidated closing metaphors - power tool primary, dropped robot librarian
5. ✅ Added "after deletion" aftermath beat (exported backup, never opened it)
6. ✅ Added emotional use case caveat (brain-dumping vs. conversation distinction)

### COULD Fixes Applied:
1. ✅ Kept opening hook length (absurdity is the point)
2. ✅ Added personal bridge to Section 1: "I'd check ChatGPT the way folks check TikTok"
3. ✅ Simplified harsh language: "Chatbots don't care. People do."
4. ✅ Cut Share Sheet tongue-twister joke (didn't land)
5. ✅ Added Claude/Copilot to tool mentions (no Grok)
6. ✅ Simplified GitHub setup explanation: "I'm a nerd and it makes me feel like a hacker"

## Key Content Captured

### Personal Stories (All Integrated):
- 3 AM mad scientist tournament (primary hook)
- Counseling thread between sessions (emotional climax)
- Panic at deletion + relief afterward
- Story development threads resistance
- ChatGPT shortcuts everywhere → "What are Walmart's hours?"
- Exported all data to backup zip, never opened it
- Deleted Perplexity from phone while writing this post

### Key Insights:
- "I was petting the AI"
- "Chatbots don't care. People do."
- "The artifact matters, not the conversation"
- "The workbench is not your work"
- "Hard to decide? Yes. Hard to do? No. And nobody died."

### Technical Details:
- Perplexity Pro as primary tool
- VS Code + GitHub for notes ("makes me feel like a hacker")
- All chatbot apps removed from phone
- Browser bookmarks only
- Three-step hygiene protocol
- Actual rollup prompt (in code block)
- Gemini custom instructions
- 7-point checklist

### Caveats:
- Works for my brain (ADHD)
- Multi-turn improves reasoning when needed
- Some benefit from conversational AI (loneliness, social anxiety)
- Brain-dumping vs. ongoing conversation distinction
- Access patterns matter, not the tool itself
