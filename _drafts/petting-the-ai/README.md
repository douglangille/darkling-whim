## Key Revisions Made During Drafting

### Repetition Fixes:
1. ✅ "Visit with purpose, use it, put it down" - kept only in Section 6 (Closing)
2. ✅ "Friction forces intentionality" - simplified in checklist
3. ✅ Merged checklist Points 2 & 5 (both about apps/bookmarks)

### Flow Improvements:
1. ✅ Cut abrupt transition from Section 3
2. ✅ Changed Section 1 ending to "Here's how it happens."
3. ✅ Fixed Section 2 opening fragment
4. ✅ Cleaned all section headings (no enumeration, no "Opening Hook" or "Closing")

### Emotional Journey:
1. ✅ Added decision moment: "Then I stared at the 'delete all chats' button for longer than I want to admit. Finally clicked it."
2. ✅ Clarified artifact vs. conversation philosophy
3. ✅ Tightened closing line to avoid "need" repetition
