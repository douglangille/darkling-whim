## Editorial Tweaks Applied in Final Polish

### Structural Improvements:
1. ✅ Added section breaks (---) for visual breathing room
2. ✅ Formatted custom instructions as block quote with context ("yes, it's dense—that's intentional")
3. ✅ Bolded all checklist items for scannable hierarchy
4. ✅ Separated "A Few Caveats" as distinct section
5. ✅ Improved protocol formatting (numbered + bold headers)

### Voice Refinements:
1. ✅ Opening hook: "This isn't productive. It's not even fun." (tighter rhythm)
2. ✅ Maintained Doug's conversational fragments throughout
3. ✅ Preserved vulnerability moments (backup file, deletion hesitation)
4. ✅ Kept intellectual honesty in caveats without hedging main argument

### Readability Enhancements:
1. ✅ Visual hierarchy clear throughout
2. ✅ Block quotes distinguish instructional content
3. ✅ Section breaks create natural reading rhythm
4. ✅ Bold headers make checklist actionable at a glance
