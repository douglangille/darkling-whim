## Opening Hook

It's 3 AM. I'm in bed. I've gone from reading political news to spinning scenarios with ChatGPT about a "mad scientist vs. mad engineer" epic battle tournament that somehow evolved into a 7-season reality TV series concept.

This is not productive. This is not even fun anymore. This is doom chatting.

But this wasn't a one-time thing. I had hundreds of ChatGPT threads I couldn't bring myself to delete. I'd named some of them to "preserve context." I felt *guilt* about clearing them out—not because they were valuable, but because deleting them felt *wrong*.

That's when I realized: I was petting the AI.

This post is about how I stopped treating chatbots like companions and started treating them like the power tools they actually are.
