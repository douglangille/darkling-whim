# Research Notes: Stop Petting the AI!

## Section 1: Hook - Personal Stories

### Story 1: The 3 AM Mad Scientist Tournament (PRIMARY HOOK)

**Context**: Phone in bed habit (already bad) made much worse by AI chatbots

**Progression**:
1. Started with news item, asked questions to "quiet my mind"
2. Paradox: Activated mind instead of quieting it
3. Political scenario → mapping out scenarios with chatbot
4. Long thread with no long-tail usefulness
5. **The Mad Scientist Tournament**:
   - Question: What's the difference between a mad scientist and a mad engineer?
   - Ended up creating tournament seed
   - Mad scientists from history vs. mad engineers from history
   - Battle royale tournament format
   - Became a reality TV series concept
   - **Seven different seasons**
   - At **3 AM**

**Doug's reflection**: "It was ridiculous. It was fun. It was entertainment, but it was not something that a person should be doing at three in the morning."

### Pattern: Doom Chatting

**Evolution**: Screen time → doom scrolling → **doom chatting**
- Not just reading
- Not just scrolling social media  
- Actively engaging with AI in unproductive loops

### Story 2: Named Threads & Context Frustration

**Habit**: Creating long chat threads, giving them names, trying to preserve context
- Wanted tool to "know everything" in that particular context
- Tool forgets anyway
- End up reminding the tool constantly = frustration
- Same with story brainstorming: great initially, loses value with long context

**Key insight**: "I don't want to have any emotion with the tool. It is just a tool."

### Story 3: The Hundreds of Threads

**The Problem**: 
- Had ChatGPT Plus subscription
- Accumulated **hundreds and hundreds** of chat threads
- **Couldn't delete them** - not because they had value, but because deleting felt wrong
- "It was a nightmare"
- Had to "call shenanigans on the whole thing"

**The Realization**: The chat threads themselves don't have value, but treating them like they do.

## Hook Structure (Proposed)

**Opening paragraph**: The 3 AM mad scientist tournament story - vivid, funny, relatable

**Second paragraph**: Name the pattern - "doom chatting" as evolution of doom scrolling

**Third paragraph**: The real problem - "I had hundreds of chat threads I couldn't delete. Not because they had value. But because deleting them felt wrong. That's when I realized: I wasn't using a tool. I was petting the AI."

## Section 4: Architecting a Defense - Doug's ACTUAL SETUP

### Current Tech Stack (Evolving)

**Perplexity Pro** (paid annual membership, Dec 2024):
- Primary tool choice
- Eliminates tool-choice paralysis
- Access to GPT, Gemini, and Claude models all in one place
- Connected to GitHub via MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- All notes stored in private GitHub repo
- Context management through GitHub (potential future post topic)

### Device Strategy

**REMOVED from devices**:
- ChatGPT app
- Gemini app

**Why removed**:
- Live chat feature was interesting but not always helpful
- Live camera feature (for farm problem-solving) felt awkward
- Prefers typed/dictated questions over interactive conversation
- **Early defense mechanism**: Avoid interactive conversation = avoid parasocial relationship
- Wants transactional interaction: "I submit a question, you give me an answer"

**KEPT on device**:
- Perplexity app (only chatbot on phone)
- **Technical reason**: Apple Share Sheet integration
  - Share articles from feed reader/Safari directly to AI
  - Faster workflow for content-based queries
- **Practical reason**: Daily life utility (e.g., take picture of chickens, ask questions)
- Browser bookmarks to all chatbots "at the ready"

### The Three-Step Chat Hygiene Protocol

**Auto-delete where available**:
- Gemini: Only tool that supports auto-delete (threads older than 3 months)

**Manual deletion protocol** (for Perplexity and others):
1. **Finish conversation**
2. **Harvest takeaways**: 
   - Paste pre-written prompt (stored in Apple Note)
   - Asks AI to review chat and extract key takeaways
   - Output in markdown format + code block
   - Manually paste into notes (GitHub)
3. **Delete thread immediately**

**Results**:
- "Gone a long way in improving my chat hygiene"
- Better handle on notes
- Can actually review what's been written (personally, creatively, at work)
- No thread accumulation

### Content-First vs. Boredom Entry

**The Problem with Apps on Phone**:
- If app is on phone (social media, ChatGPT, etc.) → use during idle moments
- Waiting somewhere? Out comes the phone
- Not scrolling social media? Petting the chatbot
- Same pattern, different tool

**Doug's Phone Philosophy**:
- NO social media apps on phone
- Only human communication apps (Messenger, text)
- NO chatbots for idle chatting
- Staying present with humans in the circle

**The Friction Strategy**:
- If you have a question/content/reason → intentional action required
- Must open app OR open browser bookmark
- Friction = intentionality
- "All rules should be flexible" but defaults matter

### Key Quote

"The stupid Apple Share Sheet" - tongue twister joke, keep this

## Section 6: Practical Checklist - TO BE CLARIFIED

Based on Section 4, the checklist should include:

1. **Turn on auto-delete** (Gemini supports 3-month auto-delete)
2. **Remove chatbot apps from phone** (except one for Share Sheet if needed)
3. **Create harvesting protocol**:
   - Write/bookmark a takeaway extraction prompt
   - Review → Save gold → Delete thread (three steps)
4. **Use browser bookmarks** instead of apps when possible
5. **Remove social media apps** to reduce idle phone usage
6. **Add intentional friction** between impulse and action

**Still need from Doug**:
- The actual takeaway extraction prompt he uses
- His `!nbox` workflow details (if different from harvest protocol)
- Any other specific recommendations

## Core Themes Emerging

1. **Doom chatting** - new behavior pattern to name
2. **Activation paradox** - seeking calm, creating engagement
3. **False value in threads** - treating ephemeral conversations as archives
4. **Emotional attachment to tool** - the inability to delete
5. **Context frustration** - tools forget, we remind, cycle continues
6. **Transactional vs. conversational** - defense against parasocial drift
7. **Friction as feature** - intentional barriers protect presence
8. **The core truth**: "I don't want to have any emotion with the tool. It is just a tool."

**Status**: Section 4 complete. Section 6 needs final clarification (takeaway prompt, any other checklist items).
