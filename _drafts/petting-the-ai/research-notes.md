# Research Notes: Stop Petting the AI!

## Section 1: Hook - Personal Stories

### Story 1: The 3 AM Mad Scientist Tournament (PRIMARY HOOK)

**Context**: Phone in bed habit (already bad) made much worse by AI chatbots

**Progression**:
1. Started with news item, asked questions to "quiet my mind"
2. Paradox: Activated mind instead of quieting it
3. Political scenario → mapping out scenarios with chatbot
4. Long thread with no long-tail usefulness
5. **The Mad Scientist Tournament**:
   - Question: What's the difference between a mad scientist and a mad engineer?
   - Ended up creating tournament seed
   - Mad scientists from history vs. mad engineers from history
   - Battle royale tournament format
   - Became a reality TV series concept
   - **Seven different seasons**
   - At **3 AM**

**Doug's reflection**: "It was ridiculous. It was fun. It was entertainment, but it was not something that a person should be doing at three in the morning."

### Pattern: Doom Chatting

**Evolution**: Screen time → doom scrolling → **doom chatting**
- Not just reading
- Not just scrolling social media  
- Actively engaging with AI in unproductive loops

### Story 2: Named Threads & Context Frustration

**Habit**: Creating long chat threads, giving them names, trying to preserve context
- Wanted tool to "know everything" in that particular context
- Tool forgets anyway
- End up reminding the tool constantly = frustration
- Same with story brainstorming: great initially, loses value with long context

**Key insight**: "I don't want to have any emotion with the tool. It is just a tool."

### Story 3: The Hundreds of Threads

**The Problem**: 
- Had ChatGPT Plus subscription
- Accumulated **hundreds and hundreds** of chat threads
- **Couldn't delete them** - not because they had value, but because deleting felt wrong
- "It was a nightmare"
- Had to "call shenanigans on the whole thing"

**The Realization**: The chat threads themselves don't have value, but treating them like they do.

## Hook Structure (Proposed)

**Opening paragraph**: The 3 AM mad scientist tournament story - vivid, funny, relatable

**Second paragraph**: Name the pattern - "doom chatting" as evolution of doom scrolling

**Third paragraph**: The real problem - "I had hundreds of chat threads I couldn't delete. Not because they had value. But because deleting them felt wrong. That's when I realized: I wasn't using a tool. I was petting the AI."

## Section 4: Three-Device Stack - TO BE CLARIFIED

**Questions pending**:
- Is this Doug's actual current setup?
- Gemini (phone/iPad) as self-cleaning, 3-month memory tool?
- Perplexity + GitHub as the serious workbench?
- Claude/Mistral as specialized prose tools?
- Specific examples of how this has worked?

---

## Section 6: Practical Checklist - TO BE CLARIFIED

**Current items** (from original outline):
- Turn on auto-delete for mobile AI
- Remove archival AI tools from the phone
- Use share sheets or browser integrations so AI is invoked by content, not by boredom
- Keep a Git-backed `!nbox` for keeper outputs

**Questions pending**:
- Keep all 4 items or modify?
- Other specific actions to recommend?
- Real examples from Doug's implementation?

## Core Themes Emerging

1. **Doom chatting** - new behavior pattern to name
2. **Activation paradox** - seeking calm, creating engagement
3. **False value in threads** - treating ephemeral conversations as archives
4. **Emotional attachment to tool** - the inability to delete
5. **Context frustration** - tools forget, we remind, cycle continues
6. **The core truth**: "I don't want to have any emotion with the tool. It is just a tool."

**Status**: Sections 4 and 6 need clarification before proceeding to drafting.
