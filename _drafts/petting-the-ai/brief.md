## Purpose

**Goal**: This post will help educators and learners who use AI tools regularly go from relying on willpower to manage their AI usage to designing systems and constraints that create healthy boundaries by default.

**Type**: ☑ Teach ☑ Persuade [ ] Reflect [ ] Entertain [ ] Document

**One Thing to Remember**: Design your AI tools for boundaries; don't rely on willpower to maintain them. Set up systems and rulesets for responsible AI use to avoid the parasocial and addictive natures of these tools.

## Core Ethos

**The Virtuous Cycle**:
1. **Action** → Hope
2. **Hope** → Motivation  
3. **Motivation** → More Action

Action precedes motivation. By taking concrete steps to architect our AI tool usage, we create hope that healthy patterns are possible, which builds motivation to maintain them.

**Design Principle**: When we encode our intentions into our devices and tool choices, we reduce reliance on willpower and prevent emotional drift toward parasocial attachment.

## Scope

**Length**: Flexible (~1,500 words as guideline)

**Focus**: System design for AI boundary management

**Defer These Tangents**:
- Deep dive into AI ethics or sentience debates
