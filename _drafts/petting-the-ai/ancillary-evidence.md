# Research Status: Stop Petting the AI!

## Deep Research In Progress

Doing evidence-based research on:

1. **Parasocial relationships with AI systems**
   - How they form and escalate
   - Why they feel emotionally real despite being one-directional
   - Neuroscience of human-AI interaction

2. **Chat thread accumulation as compulsive behavior**
   - Archive hoarding patterns
   - Why deletion feels wrong (loss aversion, status quo bias)
   - Parallel to digital hoarding research

3. **System design vs. willpower for behavior change**
   - Why constraints work better than discipline
   - Choice architecture and defaults
   - Neurodiversity considerations (ADHD, executive function)

4. **Doom scrolling vs. doom chatting**
   - Attention/dopamine engagement patterns
   - Active vs. passive consumption differences
   - Sleep disruption from screen-based AI interaction

5. **Friction as design feature**
   - How friction reduces compulsive behavior
   - Phone app removal studies
   - Intentionality gap between impulse and action

6. **Custom instructions/constraints for neurodivergent users**
   - Executive function support through tool design
   - Exit protocols and their effectiveness
   - Preventing engagement-loop activation

## Neurodiversity Considerations

**Important note**: Doug identifies as neurodivergent, which means:
- His brain's reward/dopamine system may work differently
- Executive function challenges may make parasocial attachment MORE likely
- System design constraints may be MORE important (not less) for ADHD brains
- Default behavior (without friction) may be more problematic
- His approach is evidence-informed FOR neurodivergent patterns

**Will surface**: Any research showing differences in how neurodivergent vs. neurotypical individuals form parasocial attachments or respond to constraint-based systems.

## Contrary Evidence to Research

Also looking for:
- Studies showing chat threads DO have long-term value (if genuine)
- Evidence that longer conversations improve AI output quality
- Research suggesting multi-turn conversation prevents parasocial attachment (vs. transactional)
- Willpower-based approaches that work (and for whom)
- Cases where chatbot interaction improves mental health (vs. harms it)
