## Scene: First Drive

The sun slants through the windshield, painting a warm glow across the dashboard. The car idles softly, its engine humming like a contented cat. Dad sits in the passenger seat, a calm smile on his face, while his daughter, Lily, grips the steering wheel with a mix of excitement and nerves.

Dad’s voice breaks the quiet, “Okay, Lily. First things first—check the mirrors.” Lily adjusts them, eyes widening at the view. “Good. Now, put the car in drive.” She presses the gear shift, feeling the car shift smoothly. “Feel the car shift. It’s smooth. Remember, keep your hands at 10 and 2.” She positions her hands, and Dad nods approvingly.

The car moves forward, a gentle thud as the tires kiss the asphalt. Lily’s heart races, but Dad’s steady voice steadies her. “Slowly, just a few miles per hour. Look ahead, not at the road.” She glances ahead, eyes scanning the lane. “Now, let’s practice turning. Turn right at the next intersection.” She steers, the car swaying slightly. “Good. Keep the wheel straight, and don’t over‑steer.”

A gentle breeze ruffles Lily’s hair as they cruise down the quiet suburban street. The car’s interior feels like a small, safe world where learning and trust coexist. “Dad, I think I’m getting the hang of it,” she says. “You’re doing great. Just remember: patience, focus, and a steady hand.”

The scene ends with the car idling at a stoplight, the father’s encouraging grin reflecting in the rearview mirror, and Lily’s confidence growing with each passing mile.
