## Scene: The Highway Challenge

The afternoon sun climbs higher as they merge onto the highway. Lily's knuckles are white against the steering wheel, her breathing shallow. "Dad, there are so many cars," she whispers. Dad leans back in his seat, his voice steady and reassuring. "You've got this. Check your mirrors, signal early, and merge smoothly."

She flicks the turn signal, watching the cars blur past. Her lane opens up, and she eases the car forward. The engine roars slightly as she accelerates, and for a moment, panic flickers across her face. "That's the engine responding to your input. You're in control," Dad says, placing a hand on the dashboard. "Feel the road beneath you."

Lily settles into the rhythm—the gentle hum of the tires, the whoosh of wind, the pulse of the engine. Mile markers flash by. Her grip relaxes, her posture straightens. A small smile plays at her lips. "I'm actually doing it," she breathes.

"You are," Dad confirms, pride evident in his voice. "Remember this feeling. This is where confidence begins."

As the highway stretches endlessly ahead, Lily realizes something fundamental has shifted. The road is no longer frightening—it's full of possibility.
