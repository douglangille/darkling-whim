**1. The Cove of Whispering Tides (Primary Setting)**
- **Description:** A secluded, crescent-shaped cove nestled within a heavily eroded section of the coastline. High cliffs, scarred by ancient landslides and rising sea levels, shelter it. A unique formation of underwater geothermal vents feeds a vibrant bioluminescent algae bloom, giving the water a soft, ethereal glow at night. The cove is surprisingly fertile, with resilient salt-tolerant plants and unique tidal pools teeming with life. Remnants of old-world fishing weirs are visible at low tide.
- **Climate/Seasons:**
  - **General:** The area experiences a hyper-maritime climate, with increased humidity and stronger winds due to the altered weather patterns.
  - **Spring:** Characterized by intense "surge tides" caused by unpredictable weather systems, leading to dramatic fluctuations in water levels. The bioluminescent bloom begins to intensify.
  - **Summer:** Milder temperatures, but frequent fog banks roll in, obscuring visibility. The algae bloom reaches its peak, creating stunning nighttime displays.
  - **Autumn:** The most volatile season, with powerful storms (hurricane remnants) bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds. Coastal erosion is most severe during this time.
  - **Winter:** Relatively mild temperatures compared to inland areas, but frequent gales and icy conditions make travel dangerous. The algae bloom diminishes but remains present.
- **Nova Scotia Inspiration:** The rugged coastline, dramatic tides, and importance of the sea strongly echo Nova Scotia's geography. The geothermal vents and bioluminescence add a sci-fi twist while alluding to the unique marine ecosystems found in the region. The weather patterns reflect the increasing intensity of storms and coastal erosion facing the province.
