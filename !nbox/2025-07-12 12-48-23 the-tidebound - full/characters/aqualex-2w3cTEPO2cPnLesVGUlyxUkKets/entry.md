It's important to develop Aqualex as more than just a faceless enemy. Here's a character description, keeping in mind that Aqualex is an *organization* but represented by its key figures like Commander Rexton [CHA-03]:

**Aqualex: The Oppressive Force**
- **Core Identity:** Aqualex is a powerful, technologically advanced organization that controls resources and enforces its will in the post-collapse world. They are characterized by:
  - **Ruthless Efficiency:** Aqualex values order and control above all else. They operate with cold precision, prioritizing results over ethical considerations.
  - **Technological Superiority:** Their advanced technology gives them a significant advantage. This includes:
    - Drones for surveillance and combat.
    - Sophisticated weaponry.
    - Data networks for tracking and control.
    - Potentially, technology for manipulating or exploiting natural resources (like the algae).
  - **Expansionist Ambitions:** Aqualex seeks to expand its territory and consolidate its power. They are driven by a desire to rebuild civilization in their own image, even if it means oppressing others.
  - **Environmental Exploitation:** They see the natural world as a resource to be exploited. This is a key point of conflict in the story.
  - **Hierarchical Structure:** Aqualex has a rigid command structure. Obedience and loyalty are highly valued. Dissent is crushed.
- **Visual Representation:**
  - **Uniformity:** Aqualex personnel often wear uniforms or standardized gear that emphasizes their collective identity and authority.
  - **Color Palette:** Their colors might be cold and metallic (e.g., steel gray, black, electric blue) to convey their technological focus and lack of warmth.
  - **Symbolism:** Their insignia or logo should be distinctive and imposing, representing their power and reach.
- **Commander Rexton [CHA-03] as a Face of Aqualex:**
  - While Aqualex is the organization, Rexton embodies its worst traits:
    - **Authoritarian:** He is a strict disciplinarian, demanding absolute obedience.
    - **Obsessive:** His personal vendetta against Kaelen [CHA-01] reveals a capacity for intense, even irrational, behavior.
    - **Ruthless:** He is willing to sacrifice anything, including the environment and his own troops, to achieve his goals.
    - **Arrogant:** He underestimates the "primitive" world of the cove and its inhabitants.
- **Deeper Considerations:**
  - **Motivation:** Explore *why* Aqualex is so driven. Are they genuinely trying to rebuild the world, or are they simply power-hungry?
  - **Vulnerabilities:** Even a powerful organization has weaknesses. What are Aqualex's? Over-reliance on technology? Internal conflicts? Hubris?
  - **Moral Ambiguity:** While they are the antagonists, are there any shades of gray to Aqualex? Do they have any sympathetic members or goals?

By developing Aqualex in this way, you create a compelling and multifaceted antagonist that poses a significant threat to the protagonists and raises important thematic questions.
