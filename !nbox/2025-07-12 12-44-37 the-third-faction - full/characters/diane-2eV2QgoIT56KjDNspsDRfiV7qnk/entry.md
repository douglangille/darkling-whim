Diane has been in the duplicity game all her life, a life serving the Huma Proper and its aims—whether she agreed with them or not. Posing as an associate in the Ministry of Interspecies Affairs, her current assignment is to observe and compromise Jak, the ineffectual husband of the Yrn princess. If the Monarch’s hold could be weakened, it would speed policy change where the two peoples could amalgamate their energies, improving their lot amid the ecological decline of the small planet. Jak’s obvious attraction to her is flattering and proves useful to her mission as Diane encourages an affair. The Yrn princess, Kara confronts Diane and it became clear that her Huma Proper assignment would not bear fruit. Fascinated and enamored by the Kara, Diane discloses her assignment and they realize they have the same desire for their world. The women concoct the Third Faction in secret from their governments and use their most trusted to conscript Jak into sabotaging the last atmospheric processor. With Kara declaring war as Regent after the Monarch’s death, Jak pleads with Diane for asylum with the Third Faction. Diane paints a picture of a Third Faction ruled world with the two of them at the head. Emergency sirens blare and Diane is recalled to Huma Proper and Jak takes up the mantle as leader of the Third Faction. At Huma Proper HQ, Diane finds the government in shambles as Yrn and Third Faction forces ransack the capital region. When the Third Faction turns on the Yrn fighters, Diane warns Kara that she no longer has influence over Jak and that the Third Faction was real and very dangerous. With the Huma Proper regime all but vanquished, Diane gathers a few remaining soldiers and they make for the Nexus to stop Jak from assassinating Kara.
