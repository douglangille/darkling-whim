Play-it-safe Jak is trapped in both a dead-end job with the Ministry of Interspecies Affairs and an arranged loveless marriage with Yrn princess Kara. Amid the saber-rattling between leaders of the Yrn and the Huma Proper, Jak finds himself romantically entangled with his exotic new co-worker Diane—a human. His mistress shares a secret with Jak—she’s a member of a Third Faction that pursues a more peaceful relationship between the Huma Proper and the indigenous Yrn: complete assimilation. She convinces Jak to plant an explosive device at the remaining atmospheric processor to force the two governments to consider the Third Faction’s solution. When the explosion plunges the city into darkness and kills his father-in-law the Monarch, Jak’s wife assumes Regency and declares open war on the Huma Proper. Fearing his complicity will be exposed, Jak pleads with Diane for asylum; she grants it under the condition that Jak kills his wife, freeing the two of them to openly stand as a mixed-species couple and leaders of a new ruling Third Faction. Jak leads a squad of Thirds through the bowels of the city to tunnels where he gains access to the Yrn Nexus that protects his people and Regent. The Thirds are killed in the process by the Yrn Guard, leaving Jak alone. Eventually, Jak confronts Kara alone and admits his infidelity and treason before committing to the act and attacks her. Huma Proper forces led by Diane storm the Nexus and prevent Jak from assassinating Kara.
