Atmos generator deployed to make planet more habitable. Displaced indigenous species Yrn. Planet-wide city called New Portland by Humans. Yrn occupy the few and shrinking rural areas, but some choose to live in the city in ghettos, not coping well with human vices.  5 years ago, Yrn terrorists caused an accident. Atmospheric Generator hit critical saturation, blocking out the sun. Perpetual night. Always raining. Sea level rising forcing Humans and Yrnians to cohabitate in the city. City turned into a near ghetto. Rain City.</p></section>
<section><h2>Jak</h2><p>Play-it-safe Jak is trapped in both a dead-end job with the Ministry of Interspecies Affairs and an arranged loveless marriage with Yrn princess Kara. Amid the saber-rattling between leaders of the Yrn and the Huma Proper, Jak finds himself romantically entangled with his exotic new co-worker Diane—a human. His mistress shares a secret with Jak—she’s a member of a Third Faction that pursues a more peaceful relationship between the Huma Proper and the indigenous Yrn: complete assimilation. She convinces Jak to plant an explosive device at the remaining atmospheric processor to force the two governments to consider the Third Faction’s solution. When the explosion plunges the city into darkness and kills his father-in-law the Monarch, Jak’s wife assumes Regency and declares open war on the Huma Proper. Fearing his complicity will be exposed, Jak pleads with Diane for asylum; she grants it under the condition that Jak kills his wife, freeing the two of them to openly stand as a mixed-species couple and leaders of a new ruling Third Faction. Jak leads a squad of Thirds through the bowels of the city to tunnels where he gains access to the Yrn Nexus that protects his people and Regent. The Thirds are killed in the process by the Yrn Guard, leaving Jak alone. Eventually, Jak confronts Kara alone and admits his infidelity and treason before committing to the act and attacks her. Huma Proper forces led by Diane storm the Nexus and prevent Jak from assassinating Kara.</p></section>
<section><h2>Diane</h2><p>Diane has been in the duplicity game all her life, a life serving the Huma Proper and its aims—whether she agreed with them or not. Posing as an associate in the Ministry of Interspecies Affairs, her current assignment is to observe and compromise Jak, the ineffectual husband of the Yrn princess. If the Monarch’s hold could be weakened, it would speed policy change where the two peoples could amalgamate their energies, improving their lot amid the ecological decline of the small planet. Jak’s obvious attraction to her is flattering and proves useful to her mission as Diane encourages an affair. The Yrn princess, Kara confronts Diane and it became clear that her Huma Proper assignment would not bear fruit. Fascinated and enamored by the Kara, Diane discloses her assignment and they realize they have the same desire for their world. The women concoct the Third Faction in secret from their governments and use their most trusted to conscript Jak into sabotaging the last atmospheric processor. With Kara declaring war as Regent after the Monarch’s death, Jak pleads with Diane for asylum with the Third Faction. Diane paints a picture of a Third Faction ruled world with the two of them at the head. Emergency sirens blare and Diane is recalled to Huma Proper and Jak takes up the mantle as leader of the Third Faction. At Huma Proper HQ, Diane finds the government in shambles as Yrn and Third Faction forces ransack the capital region. When the Third Faction turns on the Yrn fighters, Diane warns Kara that she no longer has influence over Jak and that the Third Faction was real and very dangerous. With the Huma Proper regime all but vanquished, Diane gathers a few remaining soldiers and they make for the Nexus to stop Jak from assassinating Kara.</p></section>
<section><h2>Sketch</h2><p>it's all really supposed to be backdrop to the MC's personal journey of discovering himself and what he really wants in life and choosing the life/love he wants</p><p>So an alien romance?</p><p>yeah alien inter-species love triangle</p><p>ok. straightup human-humanoid action</p><p>Can aliens and humans inter-mingle?</p><p>there are many theories on that.... in Star Trek canon (and many other sci fi universes), they rationalize the fact that most aliens are humanoid by there being a long extinct master race that, after discovering they were alone in the universe, seeded the primordial soup of many planets so that they'd live on in a fashion</p><p>So they are human, but evolved to their environment</p><p>well, humans evolved on Earth and the Yrn evolved on Yrnia..  whatever the master species was could have been entirely different</p><p>the love triangle</p><p>well, not exactly a romance, but it is the main catalyst for the change in the hero.</p><p>His name is Jak</p><p>Jak is mated with Kara but he's having an affair with the human Diana</p><p>and is mated like prearranged marriage - prearranged is the custom of the Yrn</p><p>He meets Diana at work and she's the one who concrips him into the Third Faction</p><p>Jak is a clerk in the Ministry of Interspecies Affairs</p><p>matching is made by a lottery of sorts.. selection by magic stones. or some crap like that</p><p>The Third Faction is the faction that wants actual bona fide peace (or so they profess). They are really just terrorists and has members from both human and Yrn races</p><p>The public conflict is between the Yrn and huma proper</p><p>Where I'm kinda twisted is in how Diana and Kara are really working together and using Jak</p><p>So... from Jak's persepctive, he's embroiled in this love-fueled renegade action and Diana keeps prompting him to leave Kara so they can be together.</p><p>But in reality... they're working together behind his back?</p><p>Kara is about to betray her people and side with Diana on the human side of the war.</p><p>her external motivations are that she's the daughter of the Yrn monarch and sees no future for her people. To save them, she must see them conquered and assimilated.  Her internal motivations are that maybe she herself is in love with Diana?</p><p>so... both KAra and Diana are double agents politically and Jak is the chump in the middle ... and the only one that truely believes in the Third Faction</p><p>I'm still pretty sure that the best POV is from Jak's.</p><p>You could write from all three povs</p><p>Different chapters</p><p>I think I would have to write all three POVs where needed to get elements of the plot and story out.</p><p>That would make this more a character drama than anything.</p><p>that'd be almost trodding on literary territory... O.O</p><p>so, I'll have to practice some economy in the story.. keep it on point. by writing the three strong character arcs, I doubt I'd have much room for additional subplot</p><p>You'd just have to keep the plots contained. So pick what character a certain plot point would have the most impact from</p><p>Don't overlap in other chapters.  Pass the torch instead</p><p>so, my plan at this point is to write out the three story lines for each POV and then weave it together into a single outline to see how it looks</p><p>I think that'll be the best way for you to get the whole story out</p><p>And take it from a romance to a multi-level story</p><p>I can pick the right POV for the intersecting points</p><p>Then if a chapter ends with something dramatic from one pov, you can open it in another pov in the next chapter</p><p>But also gives you the ability to pan out to wherever one party is compared to the others</p><p>So you can see what's happening in the world in more than one place</p><p>Jak is now wanting to assassinate Kara?</p><p>kill Kara so he can be with Diane. Diane is manipulating Jak</p><p>But then it's revealed Kara and Diane are working together, right?</p><p>In the other POVs, KAra and Diane are in cahoots.</p><p>So you're still thinking of taking on multiple povs then?</p><p>I think I have to.</p><p>in order to get the political bit out and to flesh out the other side of the love triangle</p><p>Hmm... so you're trying to figure out if Jak lives or dies?</p><p>So in that case, too, if you do kill Jak... he's not the main MAIN character</p><p>Kara's story goal is to save her people by arranging to have her father murdered, assume the throne and assimilate to the Huma Proper. Love with Diane complicates</p><p>I can kill Jak if it's a tragedy and the story ends there.</p><p>Are you going to have Kara in love with Diane, too?</p><p>Yeah. So you need to decide if you want it to be a series or a stand alone</p><p>yes. that's part of why they are in cahoots.. part politics and part love</p><p>Okay. So that's going to be a tough reveal/resolution at the end</p><p>Yeah, that's why I want to craft both Kara's and Diane's storyline in 3 act structure.</p><p>1. I'll figure out the right POV</p><p>Do they love each other?</p><p>and 2. I'll figure out the ending</p><p>Because then you need to deal with them... either being bisexual? Or closet gay? Married to a man, but spent their life wanting to be with a woman?</p><p>But then why is Diane with Jak if she also love Kara, etc?</p><p>Kara and Diane start off as political allies who end up falling in love. Jak loves Diane, but ultimately is too selffish</p><p>Are they discovering these feelings as they're happening?</p><p>So Diane doesn't actually love Jak back?</p><p>Diane's storygoal is that she's an operative wioth Human Proper infiltrating the Third Faction. Jak is a tool/pawn she is using to undermine it. That he's also Kara's husband is a complication. What should have been a straight using situation is complicated.</p><p>I can see Kara being gay and not saying anything because she's in an arranged marriage. Now exploring that world</p><p>But for Diane... She'd have to be bisexual in order to have feelings for both</p><p>Diane doesn't have genuine feelings for JAk</p><p>Oh okay</p><p>She's using him as a leg up</p><p>To further her mission</p><p>I was picturing it being a complete love triangle</p><p>Jak loves Diane. Diane loves Jak. Kara loves Diane. Diane loves Kara. Kara and Jak... don't love each other?</p><p>I see where you're going though</p><p>it could end up that way when I sketch out the ladies' POV</p><p>In other words, total mess for everyone. Lol</p><p>sexuality with the Yrn doesn't have to be strictly binary</p><p>True</p><p>However...</p><p>The only reason I brought it up is because of all these recent outcry with J.K. Rowlings characters</p><p>oh?</p><p>The pride community seems to be in an uproar over there not being a clear identifier as to character's sexuality</p><p>And so you might want to be careful how you approach that</p><p>ffs</p><p>Go in with a confidence  of their history</p><p>Well, I don't think it'll be an issue so long as you clearly know their history</p><p>tru. I'm glad I'm sorting that out with the outline first (edited)</p><p>They either are or aren't gay or bisexual and they either are or aren't in the closet about it</p><p>And if you're clear that in Yrn sexuality isn't so black and white as it is on Earth...</p><p>I don't see that being an issue then</p><p>Different world, right? Different societal structure</p><p>exactly</p><p>Just something to think about is all and know that you have to go in with a clear explanation</p><p>thanks.</p><p>Yours is coming along really well, too. Your characters are growing every week and I'm now seeing Kara and Diane's part in it more clearly</p><p>yeah. all three have strong arcs. I have to go back and tweak Jak-- his role became a lot more stronger</p><p>So, Kara and Diane are now the founders of the third faction? Or have they always been?</p><p>he's got a turning point where he moves from victim to leader.</p><p>Yes, the ladies created the Third Faction as a paper-organization to deflect blame. Jak ends up taking the mantle and making it real</p><p>When Kara murders her father, is that a turning point for her? If so, how?</p><p>Also... "her current assignment is to observe and compromise Jak, the ineffectual husband of the Yrn princess" - This is great</p><p>she takes agency for her path and her people. There's no going back from that. She starts out accepting the role of princess and defference to her father. Diane halps her see that he path is her own</p><p>What happens when the last atmospheric processor is gone?</p><p>that dramatically worsens the environmental calamaty. Nothing to regulate rainfall. Constant rain. Flooding.. Crowding into the cities. Food shortages</p><p>Okay... so why do they want to do this?</p><p>Are they thinking they'll gain more control through chaos?</p><p>The Yrn and Huma Proper governments are in a stalemate where the Yrn are a subject state to the HP. By putting pressure on resources (land, food, etc), it destableizes things. The HP are somewhat complacent as conquerors anyway, which make the Yrn uprising even more effective. The HP leadership falls quickly</p></section>

<section><h2>Ending</h2><p>Now... the ending... Any idea what you're doing there?</p><p>This is the first moment that the three are together in one room</p><p>Hmmm... How do you want it to end?</p><p>Well. Someone has to die so there is a Happily Ever After, right.</p><p>I hate killing characters</p><p>What faction do you want to win?</p><p>Scenarion 1. so if Jak dies (eg. Kara kills him), then Diane and Kara rule the post war world</p><p>What about an unforeseen fourth faction? Could leave it open for a second novel</p><p>And all three of them are taken by it?</p><p>Held hostage or something</p><p>Scenario 2. Kara Dies (by Diane). then Diane and Jak form the new world order</p><p>Would Diane and Jak have a love/hate relationship going on?</p><p>Scenario 3. Diane dies. The Yrn rebellion succeeds and Kara and Jak flip the tables on the HP</p><p>What one seems more plausible?</p><p>I want to make sure the story is cleaned up and tidy as a single novel. No cliffhanger last-minute fourth faction. If i sequel it, i'll have to think of something else.</p><p>I think it'd be kind of neat to have all three of them taken, leaving them to work together to survive or die at the hands of their captures</p><p>scenario 3 is kinda dumb</p><p>So it's between scenario 2 and 1</p><p>Diane is living for sure</p><p>if I were to bring forth the 4th element, I'd have to weave that into the story much earlier.</p><p>Yeah... or</p><p>It's one of the other factions gone rogue or something like that</p><p>If Jak dies and he's the protagonist, the story is officially a tragedy</p><p>True</p><p>Looks like it has to be Kara then. Lol</p><p>Diane could kill her... She's the one who fell in love with her, right?</p><p>Kills her love for the greater good or something?</p><p>Jak thinks it's going to be him... last second she goes for Kara</p><p>right. It'd be more dramatic to have Diane kill Kara</p><p>Or maybe Kara attempts to kill Diane but Diane overpowers her</p><p>Or Jak steps in to make the final decision as to who dies by dealing the final blow</p><p>Kara has no motivation to kill Diane. Diane killing her is a great betrayal and complex.</p><p>This would make DIane a complex villain.</p><p>Okay. Then I think that's the way you should go</p><p>so.. Diane kills Kara, and with the the HP in ashes, the Third Faction (which wasn't supposed to be real) ends up as the only political player left with Jak as its head.</p><p>Yeah</p><p>If there was a sequel, it'd be an Empire Strikes Back kinda thing with the HP making a comeback</p><p>Kara also seems to be the weakest in terms of your characters, so it makes sense she would be the first to go</p><p>yeah. That'd be cool</p><p>okay, i think this keeps with the seed idea i had for the story where the humans were the bad guys and the Yrn were the good guys. It all has some good colonialism drama.</p></section>
<section><h2>Setting</h2><p>i have this concept of factions... the indigenous peeps and the human colonists.</p><p>and a third faction that would have coexistance.</p><p>that my hero would be sucked into it. and be sucked into completing another terrorist act.</p><p>while the more public civil war is erupting between the colonists and the natives, the third faction is instigating things.</p><p>his third faction participation is what drives his chartacter to change in how he deals with his romantic entanglement</p><p>so, there are really two intertwined story lines... the political one and the love triangle one</p><p>it's a small colonized planet</p><p>going to keep the tech light... these are common people, not warriors or scientists.</p><p>i'll use some typical sci-fi staples... atmospheric generators and crap like that ...</p><p>keep the language plain and in context. no need for gobble-de-gook</p><p>So humans on this planet that they discovered and are trying to invade the aliens who were there first?</p><p>humans already colonized about 50 years prior to the story.</p><p>thinking along the lines of what's happening for reals in the americas with how first nations peeps were treated</p><p>i want to tell the tale from the conquered perspective, not the conquerors</p><p>Are the aliens a nice species?</p><p>So is your MC an alien then?</p><p>yeah</p><p>tho he's not really the 'alien' right.. humans are.</p><p>Right</p><p>Okay. So he's not a human. And you're writing from his stand point. I like it</p><p>and the species is generally pacifistic, but like all cultures, there are different people--- those who would rebel and those who would assimilate.</p><p>social problems that come with being subjugated as a second-class society and all that jazz</p><p>What are your differences going to be between Earth and that planet?</p><p>thinking the colony planet is smallish, but almost totally a planet-wide city by the time the story hits. environmental disaster caused by terrorism causes the sea levels to rise, destroying all agriculture and arable land, forcing the native peoples to move into the city and creating a slum. This is what creates the conflict between the two peoples.</p><p>that the disaster was secretely caused by the Third Faction makes things interesting</p><p>Will the city look like a city you'd see on Earth?</p><p>thinking something blade runner -ish</p><p>so it's already on its way into trouble and then more trouble strikes. But if they win the war against humans... they still have the problem with environmental disassters and whatnot</p><p>It shouldn't look too much like Earth, city or not, because it's an entirely different planet</p><p>right. and the native people's influence ahould be evident.. kinda like the asian influence on bladerunner's San Francisco</p><p>Do they have any special powers?</p><p>probably not</p><p>Or are they an equal match to humans?</p><p>What about weapons?</p><p>still thinking about that one. in the face of an ecological disaster, maybe there is an economic collapse. some technology reversion to more conventional things.</p><p>You could maybe get around inventing too many by having a hoard of them steal a human's stash of weapons or something</p><p>no energy weapons or crap like that.. standard firearms and sharp/blunt weapons</p><p>But you could do some cool things, too, like some kind of explosive rock. Kinda like volcano but under a lot of pressure or something. So when they toss it it's like a bomb in a way</p><p>Not that exactly, but maybe they could use their surroundings a bit to disarm the humans or something</p><p>i could also figure out some latent power of the natives that they refuse to use for spiritual reasons but the Third Faction chooses otherwise</p><p>And drive a little bit of fantasy into it, kind of</p><p>tho i don't want to go all Great Spirit on the story and make it too much of an allegory to current problems.</p><p>low level fantasy</p><p>But sometimes if you go too out there... it's just too out there and not realistic enough to connect with or believe</p></section>
