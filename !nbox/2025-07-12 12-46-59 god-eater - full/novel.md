Detective Bruce Dunmore winced as he stood. The damp cold air settled deep into his knees. I'm too old for this. The rumble of morning traffic on the bridge overhead drowned the chatter and noise of the dozen other people on the scene. It made it easier to think.

He cocked his head to the left, meeting the young woman's dead stare straight-on. So young and such a beautiful face. She reminded him of his daughter. The victim could easily be her. No needle marks and a healthy weight. This girl lived a good life.

So why on Earth did she lie here, face-up, naked and posed with her hands folded across her chest? What do you see, little girl?

"Her name is Kylie, Kylie Chisholm," said a familiar voice behind him.  "Clothes and purse were found behind the bridge footing." Millie.

He turned. "Hey. Captain told me you wouldn't fly in until this afternoon."

"Good to see you too, Bruce."

"Sorry, it's been a long few days. Glad you made it."

Millie nodded. "Third body for the third day in a row? All like this?"

"The first one was across the harbour at Alderney Landing. Yesterday, up by the skatepark on the Commons. Both good kids."

"The ritual--"

"Yeah, like this. Naked and posed. Single deep cut up the abdomen, organs removed. The flowers are different."

She bent over to look closely. "Tree, actually. Indian pear."

Bruce looked around. "There's nothing but poplar and birch here. The killer must have brought them. Weird."

"Not really. Pagan burial rituals often featured a variety of flora to fill the body cavity. Besides, she wasn't killed here."

"Right, no blood. Same as the others. So, the dump locations are random, but the staging is methodical."

"No, not random."

"Really. Why do you say that?"

"The pentacle. Got a map?"

"Back at the car."

"Okay, let's go and let CSU finish up here. You owe me breakfast anyway."

"Wow, you don't forget anything, do you?"

"Nope."
