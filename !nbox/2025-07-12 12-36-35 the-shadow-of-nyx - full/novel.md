\# Shadow of Nyx

A fantasy horror about a space-faring vampire princess' rise to power against the backdrop of war with a fairy kingdom and allies

Evie, leader of the Red Guard and daughter of vampire King Artemis, takes command of the planetary invasion force only to discover an old enemy, the Lamiae Fae, had escaped Earth to the same planet the Dark Seekers now sought to conquer.  The subjugation of the Glade is brutal and near absolute until Chancellor Fortissima calls upon the Fae's demon queen, mentally unstable Lamia, whose confrontation with Artemis orphans Evie, leaving her in charge and with a terrible curse. Evie launches a campaign to not just conquer the Fae, but to destroy them once and for all; but as Evie drains Fortissima's life force, Evie's secret parentage of Artemis and Lamia becomes known, both to her and to the dangerous Lamia, leaving Evie to pit her vengeful loyalties between the Dark Seekers she's always known and her new found demon-Fae family and abilities. Lamia summons her serpentine banshee army to repel the Dark Seekers and the Fae take the war to the day and Evie forces the vampire ship to crash into the Glade, committing the Dark Seekers to conquest; all the while, Lamia psychically worms her way into Evie's mind, sowing doubt and temptation. Evie's final showdown with Lamia is as a vampire and she's on the losing end until she gives in to her demon-Fae side and bests Lamia at her own game, leaving Evie, as Nyx, the leader of both species, to decide the outcome of what has turned to a civil war.

Artemis' Nightrise

Evie had a problem. She was overwhelmed. The coven hadn't assembled like this in more than two-hundred years. She was unsure how many of the Night-seekers were even left. The ship's beacon had gone off on her watch. She verified the scans twice, then three times, to convince herself that their long journey was about to end. Finally, a whole new world. She was so thirsty. One thing at a time.

She made her way to the galley to inspect the hemoglobin stores. Waking her family from their long slumber would be taxing on the reserves. The computer's inventory had the stock listed at only three months' worth of suspended animation rations. A cranky, walking and talking multitude would exhaust these in mere days.

Evie climbed into the galley's cargo hold. She had to be sure. A visual inspection was needed. The story wasn't a good one. By her tally, only half of their supplies were intact. Much of the blood bank was blackened by frozen rot. There must have been a leak that the sensors didn't pick up.

With grim resignation, she allowed herself a single ration to get her through the rest of the preparations. Evie entered the large docking bay where the gathering would take place. There was much to convey. Brief King Artemis first, then the rouse and address the rest. She looked around the perimeter of the expansive room. Twelve-hundred souls, some kind and bright, others dark and terrible. All were her brothers and sisters in blood. Evie loved them all.

Artemis' chamber was set apart with extra safeties and a separate waking mechanism. The Red Guard's chambers were not far off. She looked over at her own empty canister. It was dark and comforting, like a womb. The human part of her wanted to climb back in and sleep. The preternatural rest of her was impatient to move through the formalities and loose herself on the planet below.

Evie keyed in the clearance codes to raise Father from slumber. While she waited, she reviewed the sensor logs and ship's manifests again. It was important to be ready. King Artemis was not unkind, but he valued efficiency.

"Greetings, Evie." Artemis' voice was rough and gravelly from disuse. Evie realized that she hadn't used her own since rising. She worked all this long time in silence. In her past life, she used to sing beautifully. Life on Earth had gotten so hard that she'd almost forgotten how. Perhaps now, in this new place, she would be free to let her spirit soar.

"Greetings, my Lord." Evie bowed her head slightly. Even after three centuries, his power and charisma continued to intimidate her. "I am ready to report."

"Please proceed," he said as he injected a hemoglobin ration into his carotid. The artery flushed with life as the ancient flesh continued its miraculous rejuvenation.

Evie, anxious to please in the face of duty, listed off the ship's status and the reason for the stoppage. "We've arrived at a compatible world, Sire."

"Are you certain?"

"Yes, my Lord. The scans have been confirmed. The environmental matrix is ninety-nine percent that of Earth."

"Biologicals?"

"Yes. The planet teems with life. We will be satisfied here."

"Excellent. The coven?"

"All check out green except for seventeen. Those canisters failed." Evie couldn't speak of the implications. Seventeen canisters, seventeen of her their family who wouldn't see the moonrise below.

Artemis was visibly affected by the loss. He closed his eyes and tried to sense the missing souls. Such sacrifice was a necessary consideration. There would be more sacrifices as they established themselves below. There were unknown threats. Of the eleven-hundred and thirty eight that remained, they'd be fortunate to colonize with half that number. "Evie, how long before you can have the coven assembled?"

"Most will rise within one hour of initiation. I can have them fed and armoured in three hours."

"Make it happen, Daughter. We have little time to waste."

Evie bowed slightly to her King and made her exit, leaving him to his planning. The food situation accelerated the timelines considerably. There would be no time for reconnaissance sorties. They'd have to land and deal with whatever this planet dealt them.

By the time she had everyone awake, the din was near maddening. Rumours and theories of what Artemis would say at the gathering varied from the ridiculous to the inane. Several fights broke out over rations. Four were killed in the scuffle and two were executed with swift justice by the Red Guard. Things settled down quite quickly after that. Such was how family matters were handled.

When Artemis strode in to the very center of the docking bay, all eyes were upon him. No one spoke as he turned around slowly to greet his children silently, taking a measure of each man and woman. They were all beautiful and terrifying. When he was satisfied, he nodded to Evie. She brought him the latest vitals from planet-side. There had been time for a probe after all. Very good. Very good indeed.

"Thank you, Evie," was all he said to her as he smiled. Be it devotion or bloodlust, she'd follow her King to greet death if he asked it of her. Artemis knew this, of course. That's why he chose her as aide-de-camp to lead the Red Guard.  She blushed at his thoughtful gaze and turned her eyes away.

"Night-seekers, it is wondrous and joyful to see all of you again! We have slept a long time. Too long for some, I'm sure." A murmur of agreement washed over the crowd. Artemis dismissed the malcontents with a raised palm. The assembled grew quiet again, waiting for their King to continue.

He did not disappoint. Artemis' voice boomed. "The wait is finally over. We have arrived at our new home. No more hiding in shadows and crypts. We can hunt openly and freely. There is so much life here, all novel and exciting."

The docking bay erupted with jubilant applause. The noise was deafening. The King had them, frenzied and excited. "We can run! We can satisfy our thirsts. We will become stronger than ever."

Another roar of celebration washed the room as Artemis raised his fist high into the air. The King suddenly dropped his arm. Everyone quieted at once. The echo rang through the ship for a few moments. Then it too was still. All that could be heard was the engines' quiet hum.

King Artemis then addressed his rapt subjects in a voice low and playful. "There is a surprise for us down there." His smouldering eyes sparkled as they swept the crowd. He held his tongue for a breathless moment of anticipation.

"What good is a hunt, if there is no challenge? What good is a hunt, if true death isn't on the line? We are the galaxy's apex predators. We thrive on vanquishing our prey. We consume their flesh and bask in their very vitality."

His words were electric. His family of hunters buzzed with fire and fight. The air felt tight, like a dam ready to burst. Artemis gave them their reward.

"What is this surprise in store for us?" Another pause. "Intelligent prey. Humanoid, like us. Rich and luxurious blood. An entire civilization awaits our conquest. Thirty billion alien souls upon which to feast. It is a banquet, my children. We will drink and feed until we thirst no more. We will swell our ranks. We will become mighty again. We will consume this world. It is our way. Welcome to my table. The hunt begins tonight!"

Nightfall in the Glade

Legato and Mezzo flew as if their wings were aflame, knocking baskets of gathered berries to the forest floor far below. The twins corkscrewed their way up and around the ancient tree to the canopy of the Glade. They landed on the Great Chamber's platform at a sprint. Chancellor Fortissima of the Faie waited for her couriers to catch their breath.

"But Milady, we have to share these foul tidings," insisted Mezzo.

She dismissed his concerns with a subtle nod. "I need clear words, young Mezzo. Take some nectar and bring your thoughts to order."

Legato rubbed the salve brought him by the Chancellor's handmaiden. His wings ached and the paste cooled his shoulders. He knew the young girl from his youth, but her name eluded him.

The elder Legato always carried himself more reserved than his slightly younger brother. He understood that whether in the role of leader or Auntie, the Chancellor was more often right than wrong. So he placed a hand on Mezzo's shoulder and offered the bowl of medicine. Mezzo nodded, traded with the nectar, and they refreshed themselves.

Fortissima waited with patient grace before taking away the bowls; she handed them to her handmaiden and bade the boys to sit.

"Now, what news of South Farthing? Has it fallen?"

Legato spoke up. "Yes, Auntie??" I mean, Chancellor. The Night-Seekers breeched the forest gates a few hours ago. Bravura insisted on us joining the fight. She wouldn't abandon them."

Mezzo voice shook. "She screamed while they fed. They plucked her wings and sucked them dry. We couldn't save her. We couldn't. We tried but there were so many."

Legato hung his head and murmured, "We fled, Auntie."

"How many of the aliens did you see?" asked Fortissima. The last reports were that they hunted in small patrols, organized yet nimble.

Legato raised his head and looked up at the beautiful Chancellor, her translucent wings reflecting flickers of torchlight. She stood painfully regal and misplaced amidst this garish interruption, her eyes sparkling wide in curious fascination.

Legato flushed with anger and frustration. "This wasn't a hunting party, Chancellor. There were hundreds, an army, just like Spinto warned. They are headed here, to the North."

Fortissima's features shimmered and shifted as she assumed a warrior's poise. "Your Uncle Spinto isn't here, is he?" she responded sharply. "The coward fled, like so many. We will not."

Legato fell silent, chastised.

"There's more, Auntie," said Mezzo.

"Oh?"

"The invaders numbered too many to match the skyship we saw them land in."

Legato interrupted. "Some of the Night-Seekers had wings too, like us."

"I don't think all of us Faie are food," said Mezzo, shuddering.

"This does not bode well, children. I know who these creatures are. They've found us. I don't know how, but they have. But worry not, I've called for help."

A thunderous crack ended the conversation as a large branch fell from above, knocking over the torches and setting the platform ablaze.

Shouts of pain and surprise surrounded the Great Chamber as the Chancellor's Guardians greeted the invaders, yet fell one by one. Ever protective, Fortissima stood in front of her brethren as the company of Night-Seekers clambered on the platform. She marveled numbly that the aliens' backs didn't sprout wings but they nonetheless moved with acrobatic ease and uncommon swiftness.

The smallish handmaiden, caught on the far side of the platform closest to the newcomers, flitted and bounced awkwardly, trying to crawl away; her right wing hung at a queer angle, preventing her flight. A larger Night-Seeker broke rank and grabbed her by the back. Fortissima blanched in horror, watching as the brute snapped her tiny body, drank from her midsection and passed the remains back through the throng.

"Oh, Aria!" cried Fortissima. Legato's knees weakened at the mention of the forgotten name. Mezzo steadied him as the noise and chaos rose to a frenzied crescendo.

"Enough," shouted a strong feminine voice from within the ranks and the party fell silent. Only the crackling fire below and the rapid breathing of the Night-Seekers could be heard over the racing hearts of the Faie. The company parted as a lone female Night-Seeker came forward and stood in front, facing the Great Chamber.

Legato and Mezzo took wing and assumed flanking positions on each side of Fortissima. The Chancellor felt small but not altogether powerless; not all specie of Faie were small and flighted. Even in this place, there were secrets. But where were the Lamia? Why didn't they answer? She straightened her back and regarded the woman approaching.

With her wings extended, Fortissima spoke. "How dare you defile our Glade, Night-Seeker?"

The woman walked forward, removed her gauntlet and offered her hand. She spoke slowly and evenly. "Chancellor Fortissima, I presume? My name is Evie. We did not expect to find Faie this far out. Extraordinary."

Fortissima stood fuming and silent, her wings swirling in deep greens and blues.

Evie smiled and dropped her hand. "No matter. My father will be pleased."

"Tell Artemis I'll be awaiting his visit."

The Dark Pool of Lamia

Lamina wrapped the mottled scarf around her light frame, enjoying the silky sensation as the soft cool hide hugged her contours. She didn't have need of mirrors to know the truth of her beauty, only to close her eyes and run her palms down her middle to feel the smooth scales. Drawing her hands up to under her bare breasts, the rough utility of the garment hid many secrets. The Queen opened her eyes and caught the flecks of starlight shimmering and reflecting her regency.

The dark pool at the center of the Hall captured not only the night's dim twinkles but both Sky Sister moons as well. No flame ever needed grace the room.

A flutter of wing announced a visitor, a rarity yet bothersome. "What can the Lamiae do for you, dear Chancellor Fortissima?" she asked, gathering the rest of the snakeskin over her shoulder.

Fortissima was accustomed to Lamia's display, in spite of losing three husbands to the succubus. Anger held no place in her heart anymore, not since her own ascension to power. "You are aware of the happenings above?"

"Of course," said Lamia as she bade the other woman closer. "The Night Seekers. They've returned to feed on your kind."

Fortissima could barely veil her contempt. "And yet, you do nothing, Maestra Lamia." She deliberately yet tenuously stepped within the demon's striking arc, a posture of defiance.

"I tire of your petty squabbles," said Lamia dismissively. She touched the Chancellor's veined wing and felt her pulse, strong and vibrant.

The Chancellor pressed. "That may be so, My Lady Queen, but without subjects, over whom shall you rule?"

Lamia stepped impossibly closer, her menace forcing deference. "Careful, Fortissima. I may yet hunger for your sons."

Fortissima nodded slowly. "Your Pardon, My Liege. We're dying. Artemis' coven is too strong, too numerous."

For the first time, Lamia brightened to the present calamity. "Artemis? He found you here in the Glade? Pray that your Unseelie fortune be swift."

Fortissima dropped to her knees, skirts trailing behind her. "We need you, Queen. We need the Lamiae to stand against the Night Seekers."

"Their blood is stale," said Lamia with disgust.

"They eat your children. Again." Fortissima rose and smoothed her wings. "What have you? Will you not act?"

Lamia bowed her head and fussed with her wrap as she considered the plight of Fortissima's court. She'd tussled with Artemis before. He proved both a formidable lover and vicious enemy. Many winters have passed since then. She looked up, a spark of an idea forming.

"Tell me, does the Dark King have any sons?"

Fortissima walked to the pool and examined its depth, not quite brave enough to touch it. "My spies tell me he's only sired a daughter. Evie, of King Artemis' Red Guard."

"Evie," said Lamia to herself and then to Fortissima, "Take your leave, Chancellor. The Lamiae will stand."

"Thank you, Your Grace."

Fortissima took wing and exited the Hall, leaving Lamia to gaze at her reflection in the dark pool as if for the first time.
