Dorian Weist: Sam's older brother, a trained witch who returns home to help guide Sam through her magical awakening, but becomes entangled in a darker plot.

Dorian Weist is a tall, athletic young man. He has a strong build, dark hair, and piercing blue eyes. He is serious and introspective by nature, but he also has a sense of humor and a strong sense of loyalty to his family and friends. His Myers-Briggs personality type is ISTP, or the "Craftsman." He is a logical and analytical thinker who is always looking for ways to improve the world around him. He is also a skilled problem-solver and a creative thinker. Dorian's enneagram type is 8, or the "Challenger." He is a strong and willful individual who is always looking for a challenge. He is also a natural leader and a protective friend.



Dorian has a serious, almost somber tone in his dialogue, reflecting his more disciplined and responsible approach to magic.

His language is more measured and analytical, using fewer contractions and more complex sentence structures compared to the other characters.

When Dorian's faith is shaken by the revelations about Erin and the Council, his dialogue becomes more emotional and confrontational.
