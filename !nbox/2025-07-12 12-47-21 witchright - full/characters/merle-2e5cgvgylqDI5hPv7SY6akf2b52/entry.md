Merle: A member of the Council of witches, who has orchestrated many of the events surrounding the Weist family in an effort to maintain the balance of power between light and dark magic.

Merle is an elderly man who is wise and experienced in the ways of the Council. He has a calm and collected demeanor, and a strong moral compass. For his Myers-Briggs personality type, Merle is an INTJ, or the "Architect." He is a logical and analytical individual who is always looking for ways to improve the world around him. His enneagram type is 1, or the "Perfectionist." He is a principled and ethical individual who strives to do the right thing, even when it is difficult.



As the representative of the Council, Merle's dialogue has an authoritative, almost paternal quality, with a tendency towards cryptic, evasive responses.

His speech is formal and measured, using complex vocabulary and syntax to convey a sense of wisdom and experience.

Merle's language hints at his own agenda and the mysteries surrounding the Council's actions, creating an air of ambiguity and distrust.
