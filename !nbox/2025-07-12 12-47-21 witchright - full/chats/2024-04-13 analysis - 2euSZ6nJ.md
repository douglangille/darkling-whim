The main character's worst moment in the novel is when Samantha Weist is nearly drained of her magical powers by the Darkling entity, manipulated by Tabitha.

Does the main character have a mentor? If so, how does the mentor influence the main character?

Yes, the main character Samantha Weist has a mentor figure in the form of her older brother, Dorian Weist.

Dorian's influence on Sam as her mentor includes:

1. Guidance and Training:
- Dorian returns home specifically to help guide Sam through her magical awakening and initiation as a witch.
- He provides instruction and training, teaching Sam how to harness and control her powers, which are more raw and untamed compared to Dorian's own more disciplined abilities.
- Dorian serves as Sam's expert guide into the world of magic, helping her navigate the responsibilities and dangers that come with being a witch.

2. Moral Compass:
- Dorian represents a more responsible, restrained approach to magic, in contrast to Sam's initial reckless use of her powers.
- He tries to steer Sam away from the temptation to use her abilities for selfish or manipulative purposes, like she does with her classmates in the cafeteria incident.

- As Sam's older brother, Dorian provides an important emotional anchor and source of support as she grapples with the upheaval in her life.
- His return home and presence helps ground Sam and gives her confidence, even as she struggles with her newfound powers.

Ultimately, Dorian's role as Sam's mentor is crucial in guiding her through the early stages of her magical awakening. His training, moral compass, and emotional support help shape Sam's journey, even as she must eventually surpass him in strength and determination to confront the ultimate threat of the Darkling.

Dorian's influence is pivotal in Sam's coming-of-age as a witch, but it is her own personal growth and commitment to her loved ones that allow her to fully embrace her power and responsibilities.
