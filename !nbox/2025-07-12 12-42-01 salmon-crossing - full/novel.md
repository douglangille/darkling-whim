Mary's husband Jake was paroled after 10 years for the killing of her accused rapist: Frenchie's boy Alan; Ted's interest in Mary doesn't sit well with Jake and in the midst of the confrontation, Lily screams and an explosive fire at the derelict pulpmill threatens to destroy the town.

Light Up My Room

By Barenaked Ladies

A Hydro-field cuts through my neighborhood

Somehow that always just made me feel good

I can put a spare bulb in my hand

And light up my yard

Late at night when the wires in the walls

Sing in tune with the din of the falls

I'm conducting it all while I sleep

To light the whole town

If you question what I would do

To get over and be with you

Lift you up over everything

To light up my room, my room

There's a shopping cart in the ravine

The foam on the creek is like pop

And ice cream

A field full of tires that is always on fire

To light up my home

There are luxuries we can't afford

But in our house we never get bored

We can dance to the radio station

That plays in our teeth

If you question what I would do

To get over and be with you

Lift you up over everything

To light up my room, my room
