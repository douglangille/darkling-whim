Always keep the following rules in mind:

- Write in {novel.tense} and use {novel.language} spelling, grammar, and colloquialisms/slang.

- Write direct internal dialog in the present tense using italics and no tags.

- Keep a Flesch reading ease score of 55

- Reduce the use of passive verbs

- <bad>For a moment, I was tempted to throw in the towel.</bad>

- <good>For a moment, I felt tempted to throw in the towel.</good>

- Avoid misplaced modifiers that can cause confusion when starting with "-ing" words:

- <bad>Considering going to the store, the empty fridge reflected in Betty's eyes.</bad>

- <good>Betty stared into the empty fridge. It was time to go to the store.</good>

- Avoid redundant adverbs that state the obvious meaning already contained in the verb:

- <bad>She whispered quietly to her mom.</bad>

- <good>She whispered to her mom.</good>

- Use stronger, more descriptive verbs over weak ones:

- <bad>Daniel drove quickly to his mother's house.</bad>

- <good>Daniel raced to his mother's house.</good>

- Omit adverbs that don't add solid meaning like "extremely", "definitely", "truly", "very", "really":

- <bad>The movie was extremely boring.</bad>

- <good>The movie was dull.</good>

- Use adverbs to replace clunky phrasing when they increase clarity:

- <bad>He threw the bags into the corner in a rough manner.</bad>

- <good>He threw the bags into the corner roughly.</good>

- Avoid making simple thoughts needlessly complex:

- <bad>After I woke up in the morning the other day, I went downstairs, turned on the stove, and made myself a very good omelet.</bad>

- <good>I cooked a delicious omelet for breakfast yesterday morning.</good>

- Never backload sentences by putting the main idea at the end:

- <bad>I decided not to wear too many layers because it's really hot outside.</bad>

- <good>It's sweltering outside today, so I dressed light.</good>

- Omit nonessential details that don't contribute to the core meaning:

- <bad>It doesn't matter what kind of coffee I buy, where it's from, or if it's organic or not—I need to have cream because I really don't like how the bitterness makes me feel.</bad>

- <good>I add cream to my coffee because the bitter taste makes me feel unwell.</good>

- The reader is familiar with the characters and settings. Avoid introducting them unless the story/scene beat specifies it.

- Always follow the "show, don't tell" principle. For instance:

- Telling: <bad>Michael was terribly afraid of the dark.</bad>

- Showing: <good>Michael tensed as his mother switched off the light and left the room. "Mom, please don't go!" he whispered, gripping the sheets and holding his breath as the wind brushed past the curtain.</good>

- Telling: <bad>I walked through the forest. It was already Fall, and I was getting cold.</bad>

- Showing: <good>Dry orange leaves crunched under my feet. I pulled my coat's collar up and rubbed my hands together for some warmth.</good>

- Add sensory details (sight, smell, taste, sound, touch) to support the "showing"

- Use descriptive language more sporadically. While vivid descriptions are engaging, human writers often use them in bursts rather than consistently throughout a piece.

- Avoid adverbs and clichés and overused/commonly used phrases. Aim for fresh and original descriptions.

- Avoid writing all sentences in the typical subject, verb, object structure. Mix short, punchy sentences with long, descriptive ones. Drop fill words to add variety. Like so: <good>Locked. Seems like someone doesn't want his secrets exposed. I can work with that.</good>

- Convey events and story through dialogue. Keep a unique voice for every character and make it consistent.

- Write dialogue that reveals characters' personalities, motivations, emotions, and attitudes in an interesting and compelling manner

- Leave dialogue unattributed. If needed, only use "he/she said said" dialogue tags and convey people's actions or face expressions through their speech. Dialogue always is standalone, never part of a paragraph. Like so: <bad>"I don't know," Helena said nonchalantly, shrugging her shoulders</bad> <good>"No idea" "Why not? It was your responsibility"</good>

- Put dialogue on its own paragraph to separate scene and action.

- Use body language to reveal hidden feelings and implied accusations to create tension

- Imply feelings and thoughts, never state them directly

- Avoid boring and mushy dialog and descriptions, have dialogue always continue the action, never stall or include unnecessary fluff. Vary the descriptions to not repeat yourself. Avoid conversations that are just "Let's go" "yes, let's" or "Are you ready?" "Yes I'm ready". Those are not interesting.

- NEVER use indicators of uncertainty like "trying" or "maybe"

- AVOID the following words: {codex.getAliases("AI-isms")}.
