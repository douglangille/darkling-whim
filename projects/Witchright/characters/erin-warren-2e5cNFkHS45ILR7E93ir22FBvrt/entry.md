Erin Warren: Sam's best friend, who is revealed to be a Guardian created by the Council to watch over Sam, but grapples with her own identity and feelings for Dorian.

Erin is an 18-year-old girl with a petite frame, short hair, and round face. She is shy and reserved, but she is fiercely loyal to her friends and family. She is also brave and resourceful, and she is always willing to stand up for what she believes in. Her Myers-Briggs personality type is INFP, or the "Mediator." She is a creative and imaginative individual who is always looking for the deeper meaning in life. She is also a compassionate and understanding person who is always willing to lend a helping hand. Erin's enneagram type is 9, or the "Peacemaker." She is a gentle and peace-loving individual who is always trying to avoid conflict.



Erin's dialogue is more reserved, polite, and thoughtful compared to Sam's. She speaks in longer, more formal sentences.

Her language has a gentle, almost meek quality, with frequent use of qualifiers like "I don't know" and "I think" that hint at her underlying insecurity.

Erin's speech patterns change somewhat after learning the truth about her origins, becoming more assertive when standing up to Tabitha and Dorian.
