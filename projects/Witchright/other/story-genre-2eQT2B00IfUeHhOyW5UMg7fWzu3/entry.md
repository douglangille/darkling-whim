Urban Fantasy: The story takes place in a contemporary setting (high school) where magic exists in secret.

Coming-of-Age: Sam's 18th birthday marks the initiation into her magical heritage, forcing her to mature and take responsibility for her powers.

Family Drama: There's conflict within the family as Sam grapples with her newfound abilities and her brother's disapproval.

Friendship: The story explores the dynamics of friendship between Sam and Erin, tested by jealousy, manipulation, and ultimately, loyalty.

Good vs. Evil: The overarching struggle between Sam's family (representing good magic) and the Darklings (representing evil) is a classic theme.

With the presence of witches, dark magic, and a final showdown, it also leans towards Witch Fantasy.

Overall, the novel seems to be a blend of Urban Fantasy, Coming-of-Age, with elements of Family Drama, Friendship, and Witch Fantasy.
