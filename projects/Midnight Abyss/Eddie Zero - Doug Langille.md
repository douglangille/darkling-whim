“EDDIE ZERO” by Doug Langille

I didn’t kill him. He was already dead.

The room was pitch black when I awoke. I fell asleep leaning against the back of the door. My shoulders tingled with pins and needles as my circulation returned. It didn’t help much. With my arms restrained like they were, it was nearly impossible to take a full breath. My head swam as my eyes adjusted to the dark. The sparks and flashes of dust motes and retinal artifacts disoriented me. I felt awash in a sea of teaming life where there was only darkness.

The power had been out for a couple of days, from what I could tell by the dim glow that ebbed and flowed through the wire mesh glass pane in the door. There was no real way to be sure though. Time was elastic for me at the best of times. These days? Well, let’s just say things are different.

The room was hot, stale and reeked with my own sweat and stink. And his as well, I suppose. I shot my foot out to kick him. It landed with a wet thud. In some ways, I was thankful for the dark. The air exchangers were out, but there must have been some venting somewhere. I heard my breathing grow frantic again, so I closed my eyes against the murk and did the breathing exercises that Doctor Goodwin taught me. She was my favourite. She always smiled at me. At least she did when she had a face. Bastards.

We were in group session when the arse fell out of the world. Doctors Goodwin and Meier were running the show with a stuffed bear as a talking stick. Barry, Emma and Hughie had all gone first. It was only me and Haley left. I was getting bored and antsy with Hughie’s crying and whimpering. I could tell Barry was too. He started rocking back and forth. Haley got up and walked around her chair clockwise, then counter-clockwise humming a nursery rhyme. Meier had to get up and guide her back to her seat. Man, these people were nuts.

Goodwin got a buzz on her cell. She glanced at the number and excused herself to take it. I watched her shapely legs swish away with approval. “I hate to see you go, but I love to watch you leave,” I mused. Then that damnable bear was stuffed in my face, blocking my view. Hughie shook it like a rattle. I wanted to punch him. That was probably why I was in restraints.

“It’s your turn, Eddie, ” said Meier. “Do you have anything to share this morning?”

“Fuck you.”

Meier shook his head and bent forward to scribble in his chart. The bald spot on his head looked like a tantalizing target. Goodwin came back and put her hand on her colleague’s shoulder. She then handed him a note. His glasses fell from his face and dangled around his neck on the chain that would later facilitate his untimely demise.

The double doors at the back of the ward burst open. I watched a small crowd of dishevelled people break in to the room. They were all bloody and tore up, but moved with a swiftness I wouldn’t have thought possible. Immediate pandemonium erupted as a melee of gore and violence swept across the room. I was frozen in shock as I witnessed the escalation. Goodwin was tackled by three assailants who started eating her pretty face. Barry vomited all over his pyjamas, but it didn’t matter. He didn’t make it out of the circle. I don’t think any of them did.

Meier and I clambered over and around each other trying to get out the south door. I threw my body against the press bar and fell through. I started to panic and yell as I couldn’t get up. I was still bound in the jacket. Meier, wide-eyed and bleeding, helped me stand and we bolted to the cell block to hide.

I didn’t realize until later that he had been bitten.

I kicked Meier again. Nothing. I was used to being hungry, but I hated being thirsty. Drinking from the toilet like a dog had to be pretty much the lowest point of my miserable life.

The dark was getting to me. At first there was a lot of noise, but it’s been relatively quiet for some time. No screaming. No growling. With the power out, I could faintly make out the sounds of the street below. Sirens. Gunfire. There was an explosion last night, but nothing in the ward.

I started pacing around the cell. It wasn’t my cell. It was Marky’s, I think. I can’t remember. We weren’t exactly reading room numbers, if you know what I mean. A lucky break in one hand and a dumb-ass move in the other, we hid in a cell that automatically sealed when closed. It had to be unlocked from the outside. Nice.

Meier and I hid like children, holding our breath. I begged him to take the jacket off, but he wasn’t having any of that. Paranoid or just an asshole, who knows? Rotten fucker. Glad he’s dead. No, I won’t take that back.

The good doctor found Jesus, Allah and Buddha. He was just hedging his bets, I thought. Sometime after the first couple of long hours, he started raving and babbling. The crowd of crazies on the other side of the door must of heard him. They started screaming incoherently and banging on the door. The lights were still on and I worried that they’d figure it out. Obviously, they weren’t likely getting inside without a working brain cell to spare. It was Meier who was driving me batty.

All at once he got quiet and passed out. Eventually, the crazies begged off to find other faces to peel and limbs to eat. I bent over him to listen for a breath or heartbeat. It would have been much easier with hands of course. Nothing.

All of a sudden he sprang forward and growled just like the freaks outside. I’d seen enough zombie movies in my time to guess where this was going. I couldn’t get out of his way in time. He tripped over me, stumbled, fell forward and slammed his head on the toilet with a dull crack. I didn’t wait to see if it would slow him down. I jumped on his back and dug my heels into his pudgy hips. I grabbed the chain of his glasses with my teeth and leaned back with all my weight, holding him down with my knees on his shoulders. His back was arched so he couldn’t get up. Meier kept trying to reach me with his hands, but his middle-age lifestyle didn’t permit the flexibility. He started gurgling and sputtering as he twisted and flailed. I rode him like a rodeo bull. Yippie!

Why the chain or spectacles didn’t break, I have no idea. Thank you, Jeebus. With one of his jerks he threw me off, but I managed to hold on to the glasses. His neck snapped audibly and I lost a couple teeth. Meier shit himself and died. That was that.

I kicked him again for good measure, as I crossed the cell for the millionth time. I stopped. Did I hear something? Was someone yelling? Yup. Words, not growls. It was Haley. Fuck. Of all my saviours, it had to be the obsessive-compulsive. I started kicking the door with my feet. “Haley! Over here!”

“Haley!” Fuck, I was getting tired of saying her name. One, two, three. One, two, three. “Haley, can you please just open the manual door lock? Pull it out, turn it one-quarter, and push it back in. That’s all you gotta do.” I had this place cased. I paid attention. I knew how things worked.

I could see her pacing back and forth through the glass, leaving little bloody footprints on the tile with her elasticized paper booties. Back and forth, chewing on her nails. ”Eddie, I can’t!” she squeaked. She was crying, of course. That was useful. “I can’t make it three! It needs to be three! Doctor Goodwin said it was okay, but it’s not!”

For Christ’s sake, why did I draw this winner? “Listen to me. It is three. Three steps. Three God-forsaken, monkey-fightin’ steps. Pull, twist, and push. Count ‘em, Haley.”

“No.” She let out a huff of air. The motion of her shoulders shook her small frame. How old was she? Fourteen? As if to answer me, she put her lower lip atop her upper and sat on the floor, arms and legs crossed. “You’re being mean to me, Eddie. Doctor Goodwin said you had to be nice to me. Remember? I won’t let you out until you say sorry.”

It was all I could do not to tear this little bitch a new one. I walked over and gave Meier another boot. Then another one, real hard. I then stretched my back as far as I could. My shoulders cracked with the stress. My hands felt wet with sweat and probably blood. I was clenching my fists, digging my nails into my palms. With great effort, I forced myself to relax my hands. The tingle of the change in blood circulation made them hurt. I ignored it.

“Haley, I’m sorry.” I put on my ‘good guy’ voice. I don’t usually take this pansy-arse out to play. I felt like kicking my own ass. Embarrassing. “Please, just let me out. We’ll figure this out together? Are you hungry? I know how to score us some food.” My stomach rumbled at the thought, despite my rising gorge from the cell’s stench. Shit, puke and rot. Time to get the hell out of here.

“Thank you, Eddie. Apology accepted. Was that so hard?” I bit my tongue. More blood. She then stood up, now coated in syrupy red. She approached the door and did pretty much what I expected. Pull, push, pull, push, pull, push. Pull. Twist right, left, right, left, right, left. Twist right. Push, pull, push, pull, push, pull. Push.

Man, this was killing me! “Okay, Haley, open the door.” Turn, turn, turn. Open. I was free! I rushed forward into the cooler hallway and enjoyed a fresh breath.

Haley stood a couple paces away. She was afraid of me. Good. She should be. “Haley, would you be so kind as to undo these buckles?” I made the best ‘good guy’ smile I could. Oscar worthy. I turned my back to her and she crept forward. I could feel her little fingers tremble as she fiddled with the straps. It was taking forever!

I shook her and the jacket off. It fell to the floor with a thud and clang. Too loud. I pinwheeled my arms to bring them back to life. They felt extremely light, but strong. “Two or three days?”

“Only two days, Eddie,” she said. “I saw it on Doctor Goodwin’s watch. I took it from her. It’s pretty. She let me play with it once.” Haley jingled it on her wrist for me to see. It was too big for her. I felt my annoyance heat up. Bye-bye, ‘good guy’.

I pivoted on my heels and reached her in one step. She yelped like a wounded puppy when I grabbed her by the hair and pulled her face closer to mine. She had to stand on her tiptoes. That was fine with me. I held her in place like that for a three-count and then let her go. She nearly fell, but managed to keep her footing. Amazing, really, given her footwear and the condition of the floor.

“Haley, now you listen to me. I’m nuts but you’re crazy. If you weren’t just a kid, I’d drop you like a sack of moldy potatoes. If you want to live, you best heel and keep up.” I softened my tone and dropped the psycho-act. I made my point. “You hungry? Let’s hit the staff lunchroom first. Stay on your guard. The bastards could be anywhere.”

She nodded. “Yes, Eddie.” Good girl.

It wasn’t supposed to be a terribly complicated affair to find us some grub. Ha! The power was out. It was eerily quiet. It unnerved me. I turned to Haley. “You ready?”

She nodded and eked out “Y-yes, Eddie.” She skittered around me a couple paces away lest I grab her by the scruff again. Hey, whatever keeps her on her toes.

“We gotta get out of this block and to the stairwell on the other side of the common room. Let’s go. Stay behind me.” No fear of her doing otherwise.

I felt exposed as we walked in the darkened hallway. There was barely enough light to see. The waxed tile floor glowed with the ambient light from the high windows. Without the hum of machinery, I was conscious of the sound of our progress. Our breathing. Our shuffling. The wet slurpy noise as we hit an area slick with bodily fluids and other sticky bits. We came across four bodies between Marky’s cell and the monitoring station. Well, there were four separate heaps. Everything was torn and ripped apart. One pile had too many arms and another had too few heads. Haley kept trying to identify them.

“That one is Grace. She was nice. And that one there was Elias. He always touched himself down there when I saw him. Gross. That there is Paula… mixed with Charles. Some of him anyway.”

“Haley,” I hissed through my teeth as quietly as I could.

“Yes, Eddie?” she sounded almost chipper. What the fuck?

“Haley, shut the hell up before I punch you.”

“Okay,” she sang. If we weren’t already in a nuthouse, I swear she was losing her marbles. Can you do that twice? I shook my head. Focus, Eddie. Food. That’s all you need. Fix you right up.

We were coming close to the common room door. I counted another six corpse-piles. Thanks Haley. At least her naming ritual was done. The room ahead was brighter because of a skylight. I couldn’t see in as the glass was smeared with something. What I could make out would have made me shit my pants if I had anything stored up. Good thing Haley was behind me. The last thing we needed was a scream-fest. There was a shadow moving around in the common room.

“Turn around and keep an eye behind us while I scope this door.”

“Eddie, I hear something.” Haley was squinting in to the murk behind us. “There’s something coming. Hurry!”

It was then that I heard the scrape and scurry. Something was coming for sure. A low growling swelled from Heap Number Four. A grunt and then some movement. Haley started wailing “No, no, no, no, no….”

My hands were still sore and numb from the restraints. I fumbled with the latch of the door handle. A heat, red and furious, started to form behind my eyes as the adrenaline surged forward. I balled my left hand into a fist and smashed it down on top of the latch as I yanked with my right. The door wouldn’t budge. The fleshy pad of the bottom of my left hand did little to cushion the blow. My whole arm registered the pain. The predatory sounds behind us continued to grow louder. There was more than one. Oh Fuck.

Haley was at my back now, pawing at my shoulders frantically. She was terrified, panicked and useless. The rage part of me wanted to lash out at her and throw her to the dark. I fought the urge. If nothing else, it was too short-sighted. I brought my left arm around again on the stuck latch. It gave way. The door opened towards me explosively with the force of my yank. Haley and I fell backwards on the floor, closer to the advancing hunger.

The light from the common room spilled down the hallway, lighting it up like a flare. There were nine distinct movements. Nine ways to die. Their growls got louder and became screams as they reacted to the light. Three retreated from the brightness, but the other six surged forward. I grabbed Haley by the wrist and dragged her to her feet. I pulled her with me as I leaped across the threshold into the open room.

I wheeled to face the maw and yelled back to Haley, standing in shock. “Get over here! Help me close this fucking door!” She skidded over and contributed her weight as I slammed the steel door shut. I hit the emergency bolt lock as the mass of flesh and bone assaulted the now sealed door. It was savage and raw, but the sound of crushing bodies and breaking limbs were muted by the insulating reinforcement.

I took Haley’s hand and together we turned to face the horrors of the common room.

The first thing I noticed was an abundance of light. The skylight of the common room exposed the brilliance of the summer sun at its zenith. After the dark and dim of the last couple of days, my eyes issued their complaint. A dull throb rose in my forehead with the same blistering cadence as my bruised hand. I started to shiver with excess adrenaline even though the room was warmer with the sunlight. The putrescence of decay was stronger here.

To the left of the door hung Doctor Andrews. He swayed back and forth gently, casting a long shadow. His neck was at a queer angle. I guess that’ll happen when you string yourself up to a basketball net with your own neck-tie. One shoe was on the floor below him. The calf of his left leg was split open and apparently half-eaten. There was precious little left aside from the chewy tendons and ligaments. It looked like his right bicep had taken a bite as well. It was bandaged. I wondered if the good doctor had done some last bit of public service in removing himself from the zombie gene pool. What I didn’t really get was why he was moving. It looked and felt like we were alone. Sorta.

There were close to thirty people here when shit went down. Now, the floor of the common room was littered with bits of shredded human. It looked like the worst kind of food fight at summer camp. I remember a riot back in the prison’s cafeteria. Best workout ever. That was a good day. Today was not. Haley was sitting in the middle of the room, legs splayed in front of her, cradling the head of what looked like Emma. I didn’t see the rest of her. I don’t think there was a ‘rest of her’ any more. Haley was singing lightly. “Pockets full of posies. Ashes, Ashes..”

“They all fall down.” I don’t know why I joined in. The little bitch’s voice was melodic and infectious, I guess. Second verse, same as the first! This was too much. I stepped over Barry. At least I think it was him. Bloody blubber, puke and shit. Check, check and check! I had to catch myself from falling. Christ on a cracker, this floor was greasy! I crouched in front of Haley. “Quit the fucking singing.” I spoke slowly. She stopped immediately.

That was good for about a second-and-a-half. Still playing rock-a-bye with Emma, a low moan rose from her. It grew louder and louder as her young emotions boiled over. What the hell? We didn’t have time for this. I grabbed Haley by the shoulders, probably a little rougher than intended. I wasn’t known to be a gentle soul. “Haley, you need to stop.” She wouldn’t. I looked back at the door we came through. The banging and clawing had stopped. ”Look at me, for fuck’s sake.” Nothing but that god-awful wailing.

I stood up and walked around her, running dirty fingers through dirty hair. I felt my hands ball up into fists as the girl continued. I snapped around and let my backhand fly to shut her up. It wasn’t until after she had flown backwards that I registered I’d hit her with an open hand. Emma’s head wobbled out of sight behind an overturned table.

I closed my eyes and lifted my head to the ceiling and muttered “Oh fuck.” I approached Haley who flinched away from me. Rightfully so. At least she stopped with the noise. “Haley, I won’t hit you again.” I lied, of course. How was I to know that? I held out three fingers. “Haley, how many fingers do you see? Count them.”

She looked up warily, the dark expression of her eyes partially hidden by wayward hair. She brushed it away from her face and focused on my hand, the one that had struck her, now held aloft. “One, two, three. Three fingers, Eddie. Please don’t hit me, Eddie. I’ll be good. I’ll be quiet.”

“You’ll be safe with me, Haley. But you gotta buck up. Can you do this?” I said, summoning my good-guy persona again.

“That’s what Mom used to say,” she said quietly. I knew from group that her mother was recently pushing up daisies. At this little girl’s hand, no less. That’s why she was here. It’s good to keep track of these things. It’s good to remember the little details. I’d have to be more careful. No channelling ‘Mommy Dearest’ with this one. No siree, Bob.

Haley’s eyes widened as they darted from meeting my gaze to over my shoulder. “Eddie…” she gasped. Shit. Time to get my head in the game.
