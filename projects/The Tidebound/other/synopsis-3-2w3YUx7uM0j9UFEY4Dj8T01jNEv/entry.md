Okay, here's the detailed outline for "The Tidebound," now with enhanced conflict and romance:

**Title:** *The Tidebound*

**Logline:** In a resource-scarce future where the coastline of what was once Nova Scotia is drastically altered, a scavenger haunted by her past and a guardian bound by tradition must overcome their distrust and a powerful corporation to protect a hidden beach with unique regenerative properties.

**Characters:**
