**3. Aqualex Offshore Platform "Leviathan"**
- **Description:** A massive, heavily fortified platform located several kilometers offshore. It serves as Aqualex's base of operations, housing research labs, resource extraction facilities, and living quarters for their personnel. The platform is a symbol of technological power and control, contrasting with the natural beauty of the cove and the ruggedness of the coastline.
- **Climate/Seasons:** Relatively stable climate due to technological control, but still affected by major storms.
- **Nova Scotia Inspiration:** Represents the offshore oil and gas industry in Nova Scotia, but with a more dystopian and controlling twist. The name "Leviathan" hints at the corporation's power and potential for destruction.
