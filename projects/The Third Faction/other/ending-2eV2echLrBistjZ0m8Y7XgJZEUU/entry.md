Now... the ending... Any idea what you're doing there?

This is the first moment that the three are together in one room

Hmmm... How do you want it to end?

Well. Someone has to die so there is a Happily Ever After, right.

I hate killing characters

What faction do you want to win?

Scenarion 1. so if Jak dies (eg. Kara kills him), then Diane and Kara rule the post war world

What about an unforeseen fourth faction? Could leave it open for a second novel

And all three of them are taken by it?

Held hostage or something

Scenario 2. Kara Dies (by Diane). then Diane and Jak form the new world order

Would Diane and Jak have a love/hate relationship going on?

Scenario 3. Diane dies. The Yrn rebellion succeeds and Kara and Jak flip the tables on the HP

What one seems more plausible?

I want to make sure the story is cleaned up and tidy as a single novel. No cliffhanger last-minute fourth faction. If i sequel it, i'll have to think of something else.

I think it'd be kind of neat to have all three of them taken, leaving them to work together to survive or die at the hands of their captures

scenario 3 is kinda dumb

So it's between scenario 2 and 1

Diane is living for sure

if I were to bring forth the 4th element, I'd have to weave that into the story much earlier.

Yeah... or

It's one of the other factions gone rogue or something like that

If Jak dies and he's the protagonist, the story is officially a tragedy

True

Looks like it has to be Kara then. Lol

Diane could kill her... She's the one who fell in love with her, right?

Kills her love for the greater good or something?

Jak thinks it's going to be him... last second she goes for Kara

right. It'd be more dramatic to have Diane kill Kara

Or maybe Kara attempts to kill Diane but Diane overpowers her

Or Jak steps in to make the final decision as to who dies by dealing the final blow

Kara has no motivation to kill Diane. Diane killing her is a great betrayal and complex.

This would make DIane a complex villain.

Okay. Then I think that's the way you should go

so.. Diane kills Kara, and with the the HP in ashes, the Third Faction (which wasn't supposed to be real) ends up as the only political player left with Jak as its head.

Yeah

If there was a sequel, it'd be an Empire Strikes Back kinda thing with the HP making a comeback

Kara also seems to be the weakest in terms of your characters, so it makes sense she would be the first to go

yeah. That'd be cool

okay, i think this keeps with the seed idea i had for the story where the humans were the bad guys and the Yrn were the good guys. It all has some good colonialism drama.
