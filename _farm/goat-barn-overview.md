# Kid Row (Goat Barn Overview)

## Structure Details
- **Name**: "Kid Row"
- **Dimensions**: 10' x 12' structure.
- **Internal Layout**: Includes a dedicated 4' x 6' stall for the goats. The rest of the structure is utilized for hay and feed storage (including bins for other farm animals).
- **Lighting**: LED bulb on a timer (On: 03:00, Off: 16:00), shared with Butt Nugget Palace.

## Health & Management
- **Professional Care**: A farrier visits every three months to trim hooves and provide a professional assessment of body condition.
- **Regular Checks**: Owner performs routine anemia (eyelid/FAMACHA) and body condition checks.
- **Bedding**: Deep-litter management within the 4' x 6' stall area.
- **Hydration**: Lukewarm water provided twice daily to ensure consistent intake during freezing weather.

## Livestock: The Bonded Pair
- **Goat 1 (Brown)**: Pygmy / Nigerian Dwarf goat [file:6].
- **Goat 2 (White)**: Boer goat [file:7].
- **Dynamics**: They are a four-year-old bonded pair. The Boer goat is undersized due to birthing issues as a kid but maintains stability through the social bond with the Nigerian Dwarf.

## Outdoor Field & Grazing
- **Current Setup**: Goats are leashed in the back field using 15-foot lines and ground stakes with orange visibility tops [file:9].
- **Winter Routine**: Shared water dish and hay provided at the central meeting point of the leashes.

## Planned Projects
- **Pasture**: Fenced-in pasture planned for Spring/Summer 2026.
- **Goat Shed**: A dedicated goat-shaped shed is planned for construction to allow more outdoor time in the spring.
