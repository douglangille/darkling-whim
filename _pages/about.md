Doug Langille writes dark speculative fiction with teeth.

## The Work

Stories at the intersection of cosmic horror, dark fantasy, and psychological unease. Flash fiction serves as the creative workout—short, sharp pieces exploring character under pressure, worlds slightly off-kilter, and the strange made stranger.

Published works span multiple genres and formats, including an interconnected story universe (the "Haley-verse") exploring cosmic zombie horror, power dynamics, and survival at the edges.

## The Approach

Stories are built through collaboration between human vision and AI assistance. I design the structure, generate the creative direction, and own every word through extensive voice revision. AI handles mechanical drafting based on my story bibles and frameworks, then I tear through it, making it mine.

Every sentence published here reflects my authorial decisions, distinctive voice, and creative control. The process serves the work, not romantic notions of solitary genius or some bullshit purity test.

AI keeps me moving through the mechanical phases where I'd otherwise stall out and lose my goddamned mind. It maintains structure and momentum so I can focus creative energy where it matters: voice, emotional truth, craft decisions. A finished story that connects with readers beats seventeen thousand half-cooked ideas and shitty abandoned drafts.

The work gets done. The work gets better. That's the only contract that fucking matters.

## The Author

Doug lives in Nova Scotia with too many animals, not enough time, and a deep appreciation for coffee.

By day, he wrangles technology and innovation at Nova Scotia Community College. By night, he writes stories that leave marks.
