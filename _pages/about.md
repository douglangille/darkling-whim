Doug Langille writes dark speculative fiction with teeth.

## The Work

His stories live at the intersection of cosmic horror, dark fantasy, and psychological unease. Flash fiction serves as his creative workout—short, sharp pieces that explore character under pressure, worlds slightly off-kilter, and the strange made stranger.

Published works include stories across multiple genres and formats, with an interconnected story universe (the "Haley-verse") currently in development.

## The Approach

Stories on this site are drafted entirely by hand with no AI involvement in the creative process. This deliberate restriction keeps the craft sharp—every sentence earned, every character choice intentional.

AI serves as a line editor for spelling and grammar, and occasionally as a critic. Whether those opinions get followed is another matter entirely.

## The Author

Doug lives in Nova Scotia with too many books, not enough time, and a deep appreciation for coffee and whiskey (though rarely together).

By day, he wrangles technology and innovation at Nova Scotia Community College. By night, he writes stories that leave marks.
