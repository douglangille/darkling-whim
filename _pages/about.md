Doug Langille writes dark speculative fiction with teeth.

## The Work

Stories at the intersection of cosmic horror, dark fantasy, and psychological unease. Flash fiction serves as the creative workout—short, sharp pieces exploring character under pressure, worlds slightly off-kilter, and the strange made stranger.

Published works span multiple genres and formats, including an interconnected story universe (the "Haley-verse") exploring cosmic horror, power dynamics, and survival at the edges.

## The Approach

All stories on this site are drafted entirely by hand with **no AI involvement in the creative process**. This deliberate restriction keeps the craft sharp—every sentence earned, every character choice intentional.

AI serves as a line editor for spelling and grammar, and occasionally as a critic for craft development. Whether those opinions get followed is another matter entirely.

## The Author

Doug lives in Nova Scotia with too many books, not enough time, and a deep appreciation for coffee and whiskey (though rarely together).

By day, he wrangles technology and innovation at Nova Scotia Community College. By night, he writes stories that leave marks.
