*What I'm actively working on as of January 2026.*

## Current Writing

**Weekly Flash Fiction Commitment**
- Publishing one piece of short fiction every week throughout 2026
- Mix of new drafts and revised older works getting fresh attention
- Using this as consistent creative practice and skill-building

**The Haley-verse Expansion**
- Continuing the interconnected story universe
- Developing new stories featuring Haley Madigan and related characters
- Exploring cosmic horror and dark fantasy themes across multiple narratives

## Active Reading

Deep into three very different archives for craft study:

- **Jack Whyte's *Dream of Eagles* series** – Revisiting the complete cycle for scope and multi-book character development
- **Robert Service's collected poetry** – Studying rhythm and narrative power in verse (from my grandfather's copy)
- **Clive Barker's *Imajica*** – Preparing for a deep dive into epic-scale world-building techniques

## Tech Side Projects

Documenting AI integration experiments for creative workflows at [Digital Doug](https://digital.douglangille.ca). Exploring tools and techniques while maintaining the human spark in the creative process.
