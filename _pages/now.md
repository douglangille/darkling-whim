This page tracks my current creative and technology focus. It's a snapshot of where my energy is going, what I'm learning, and what's next.

Current Creative Focus
----------------------

For 2026, I am committed to publishing a piece of short fiction every week. Sometimes this will be new work; other times, it will be a revisit of an older piece with a red pen and fresh eyes.

My short fiction, the pieces I publish on this site, remains my creative "workout." These stories are drafted entirely by hand, with **no AI involvement**. This deliberate restriction is essential to my craft; it gives me the reps I need in story structure, voice, and pacing, keeping my creative muscles sharp.

I do use AI for spelling and grammar line-edits, as well as for critiques to help hone my skills.

I may or may not listen to its opinions.

Technical & Workflow Experiments
--------------------------------

> I think stuff up and write it down.

Scratching my nerd-itch, my time is focused on learning where **AI makes sense in the creative process**. The core experiment is understanding how to leverage the technology for efficiency while ensuring the human element---the spark of original thought and empathy---remains firmly in the loop. It's all about supporting, not replacing, human creativity.

I'm writing a lot about AI, emerging technology, and digital productivity on the [Digital Doug](https://substack.douglangille.ca) substack. Usually some new brain dropping there every Wednesday.

What I'm Reading
----------------

I'm deep into three very different, but equally inspiring, archives right now:

-   **Jack Whyte's** ***Dream of Eagles*** **series**: I'm revisiting the entire historical fiction cycle that reimagines Arthurian legend. It's fantastic study material for scope and character development.

-   **Collected Works of Robert Service**: I'm spending a lot of time with my grandfather's copy of Service's poetry, specifically the rhythm and narrative power of his Yukon verse.

-  **Clive Barker's** ***Imajica***: Preparing for a revisit of this epic work, studying its scope and intricate world-building.

About Doug Langille
----------------

Doug Langille is a writer and shameless technophile living the good life in Nova Scotia.

He bravely leads Digital Innovation & Development at the NSCC.

Doug doesn't usually talk about himself in the third-person.

But when he does, he tends to bend the truth.
