This page tracks my current creative focus and what's actively in progress. Updated as projects shift.

## Current Creative Focus

For 2026, I'm committed to publishing a piece of short fiction every week. Sometimes new work; other times, revisiting older pieces with fresh eyes and a red pen.

**The Haley-verse** continues to expand—an interconnected story universe exploring cosmic horror, dark fantasy, and characters under extreme pressure.

## Writing Practice

My short fiction remains my creative workout. These stories are drafted entirely by hand with **no AI involvement in the creative process**. This deliberate restriction is essential—it gives me the reps I need in story structure, voice, and pacing.

AI serves as a line editor for spelling and grammar, and occasionally as a critic for craft development.

I may or may not listen to its opinions.

## What I'm Reading

Deep into three very different archives:

- **Jack Whyte's *Dream of Eagles* series** – Revisiting the complete historical fiction cycle for scope and character study
- **Robert Service's collected poetry** – Studying rhythm and narrative power in verse (from my grandfather's copy)
- **Clive Barker's *Imajica*** – Preparing for a deep dive into epic world-building

## Technical Experiments

On the tech side, I'm exploring how AI fits into creative workflows without replacing the human spark. Writing regularly about this at [Digital Doug](https://digital.douglangille.ca).
