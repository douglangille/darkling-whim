# VS Code Development Environment

## AI Integration Stack

### Three AI Tools Available
1. **GitHub Copilot Chat**
   - 2-year educational license (until December 2027)
   - Primary coding assistant
   - Integrated code completion and chat
   - Best for: Repository work, code suggestions, inline help

2. **Gemini CLI**
   - Integrated in VS Code
   - Alternative for technical queries
   - Best for: Technical analysis, Google-ecosystem tasks

3. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**
   - Connects Perplexity Pro to GitHub repos

## Granular Control Strategy
- **Choose the right AI for each task**:
  - Copilot Chat: Code completion, repository-specific questions
  - Gemini CLI: Technical analysis, specific technical queries
  - Perplexity (via MCP): Research, worldbuilding, fact-checking

## Creative Writing Setup
- **Editor**: VS Code for markdown-based fiction writing
- **Version control**: GitHub Workbench repo
- **AI assistance**:
  - Perplexity Pro (MCP integration) for research
  - Claude web for narrative outlines and prose
  - ChatGPT web for brainstorming and plot structures

## README-Based Organization
- Folder-based README files for project organization
- Granular control over which AI interface to use per folder/project
- Workbench repo structure supports both development and creative projects

## Benefits of Centralized Setup
- All work happens in VS Code (code, writing, planning)
- GitHub integration for version control across all projects
- AI tools accessible where you actually work
- Seamless switching between development and creative contexts
