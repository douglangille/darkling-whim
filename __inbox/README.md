# Inbox Processing Guidelines

## Purpose

The `__inbox` folder serves as a **temporary intake queue** for unprocessed content. Files here should not remain permanently—this is a workbench, not a warehouse.

## Processing Workflow

### 1. Intake
Drop files here for analysis and sorting:
- Exported chat transcripts
- Legacy documents from old file systems
- Clipped articles or PDFs
- Notes that need organization
- Any content requiring review

### 2. Analysis
Each file should be evaluated for:
- **Relevance**: Does this support active work or reference needs?
- **Destination**: Which collection does this belong in?
- **Format**: Should this be converted to Markdown or kept as-is?
- **Value**: Keep, archive, or delete?

### 3. Destination Collections

- `_work` - Professional materials (presentations, resumes, work artifacts)
- `_tech` - Technical notes, tutorials, IT documentation
- `_writing` - Fiction development, story notes, writing craft
- `_life` - Personal reference, health tracking, general notes
- `_farm` - Farming operations, animal care, land management
- `_plan` - Goals, quarterly planning, tracking systems
- `_posts` - Blog-ready content for publication
- `_drafts` - In-progress writing for the blog
- `story-engine` - Story universe development materials

### 4. Processing Decisions

**KEEP** if:
- Active reference material for current projects
- Synthesized knowledge worth preserving
