# Mobile AI Workflow - iOS/iPadOS

## Core Philosophy
- **Browser-first**: Superior interfaces, consistent experience
- **Minimal apps**: Only install when functionally necessary
- **Share Sheet integration**: Primary reason for app installation

## Perplexity App Strategy

### Why Installed
- **Share Sheet integration** for iOS/iPadOS
- Required for sending articles from Safari/feeeed.app for analysis

### How to Use
1. Browse articles in Safari or feeeed.app
2. Hit Share → Perplexity to send content
3. Perplexity Pro processes with unlimited uploads and advanced models
4. **Switch to Perplexity web for follow-up work** if needed

### What NOT to Use
- ❌ Interactive voice mode (prefer tap-to-dictate)
- ❌ Primary chat interface (web version superior)
- ❌ App as default interaction method

## Voice Input Strategy
- **Use standard iOS dictation** via Safari's built-in mic
- Works across all web-based AI tools (Perplexity, Mistral, Claude, ChatGPT)
- No need for app-specific voice features

## Image/Photo Workflow
- **Upload images via browser** on any AI tool
- Take photo first, then upload to web interface
- Sacrifice: Live camera real-time scanning (acceptable trade-off)
- Retain: Full image analysis capability through uploads

## Apps NOT Installed
- ❌ ChatGPT app
- ❌ Gemini app  
- ❌ Mistral Le Chat app
- ❌ Other AI assistant apps

## Browser Bookmarks/Tabs
- Perplexity web (primary research)
- Mistral Le Chat web (personal assistant)
- Claude web (creative writing)
- ChatGPT web (occasional structured tasks)

## Device-Specific Notes

### iPhone 13
- Communication center (phone, messages, email)
- Perplexity app for Share Sheet only
- Apple Notes/Reminders for quick capture
- Music apps for 10,000-step daily walks

### iPad Mini 6
- Consumption and handheld creative tasks
- feeeed.app for RSS feed curation
- Perplexity app for Share Sheet only
- Safari for all AI interactions
- Apple Notes synced for quick capture

## Why This Works
- Consistent experience across all devices
- Better interface quality than native apps
- Full feature access without app clutter
- Standard dictation available everywhere
- Aligns with "minimal clutter" and "workbench, not warehouse" philosophy
