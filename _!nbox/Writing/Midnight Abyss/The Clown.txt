# The Clown

What lies beneath the painted mask?  
A heart of black, a soul of glass?  
Sharpened teeth and rotted tongue,  
Come on kids, let's have some fun!

A peel of white and rubber nose,  
The stink of sweat and watery rose.  
Wriggly things in frenzied hair,  
Come on kids, into my lair!

Magic cast and belly laugh,  
A blade, a rope to cut in half.  
Bright green eyes and reddish smile,  
Come on kids, and stay a while!

Chuckle, chuckle, bone and knuckle,  
Glove and fist, belt and buckle.  
Beg and plead, kneel and pray,  
Come on kids, it's time to play!

Worm and squirm and shouts of pain,  
Quiet now, it's all in vain.  
Relax, relax. It's time to go.  
Come on kids, enjoy the show.
