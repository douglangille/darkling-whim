	<p class="block28">THE NOISE BEGAN<span class="calibre3"> when Tina turned off the light. Almost as if whatever it was took that as a cue.  I was tired and laid there for a moment attempting to process what I heard, not such a good idea in the dark. The skittering, sliding noises coming from right above my head appeared to be coming from the attic.</span></p>
	<p class="block29"><span class="calibre3"> My brain attempted to identify the sounds in a calm, sensible fashion. It must be a mouse or rat, perhaps a pigeon, or some other bird.  These all seemed plausible. Were those feathery sounds? I wasn’t sure. </span></p>
	<p class="block29">My Imagination kicked in big time, sending me images of a clown with deadlight eyes and teeth made of nails sitting on the ceiling. Were those marbles he rolled across the ceiling or somebody’s gallstones? </p>
	<p class="block29">Dark, isn’t it? Fuck gravity, we all float up here above your head, friend. </p>
	<p class="block29">The words echoed inside my head like vipers hissing in a pit. In daylight, I would have laughed but in the dark, it didn’t seem all that funny. Damn you, Stephen King, and thanks for all the memories.</p>
	<p class="block29">Tina’s hand slid over and grabbed my arm beneath the duvet. </p>
	<p class="block29">“John, what the fuck is that?” she whispered urgently. Her nails dug deep into my flesh. I twisted out of her grip and reached up for the light cord.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Not sure, sweetheart, but I’m going to find out.” </p>
	<p class="block29">Waving my hand about in the darkness, I frowned a little when I couldn’t find the cord where it should be. In my mind’s eye, the clown grinned down at me holding it just out of reach. I stretched my hand out a little further to the right and, to my relief, could feel the cord. I pulled it and the light clicked on.</p>
	<p class="block29">There was nothing on the ceiling. The sound continued however.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Must be something in the attic,” I said, swinging my legs out from under the duvet.</p>
	<p class="block29">“It was crazy of me to let you talk me into moving here,” Tina said.</p>
	<p class="block29">I turned to look at her. Only the top of her head was visible resting on the pillow.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Your grandmother left it to you in her Will. I thought you’d jump at the idea of owning this pile.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“I lived here as a child. My grandmother was an evil bitch.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Wow, you hold that grudge, sweetheart. Never let it go. I kept that to myself and thought of something safer to say.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Well, she must have thought kindly of you, darling.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“She was mean and sadistic. Moving here was a bad idea. I left here as soon as I could. I never want to be the kind of person she was, so spiteful and cruel.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“What’s done is done. You could never be like her.” I said trying to play it down. “Let me sort out this little problem and we can talk about the rest in the morning.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“It better not be rats, or I’m not even going to bother unpacking. First thing tomorrow I’m moving back to the old house.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“We’re in a new house in the countryside, Tina. You have to expect these things.”</p>
	<p class="block29">I didn’t bother mentioning how we couldn’t move back to the old house as it had already been sold. I got up and reached for jeans. I’d slung them carelessly on the floor moments earlier. After a long day, moving all our worldly belongings from one house to another, I’d been looking forward to a decent night’s sleep. Now it seemed as if my day was not over after all.</p>
	<p class="block29">“If I’m not back in fifteen minutes call for reinforcements,” I said.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Just leave the bedroom light on, and don’t make too much noise.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Tina’s hand shot out from under the duvet and pulled a pillow over her head using it like a giant earmuff.</p>
	<p class="block29">I couldn’t blame her for being off with me; after all it was my fault we had to move from the old place. I slipped out of the bedroom and closed the door behind me.</p>
	<p class="block29">I headed downstairs for my aluminum combination ladder. While there, I slipped on a pair of my work boots. Standing on the rungs of a ladder barefoot is an uncomfortable experience. I also grabbed a flashlight from my toolbox, shouldered the ladder and carried it back up the stairs.</p>
	<p class="block29">Reaching the landing, I looked up at a hinged trapdoor held in place by four sliding bolts.</p>
	<p class="block29">With the ladder positioned, I climbed up it and pushed upward against the trapdoor with the heel of my hand relieving the weight from the bolts then released them one by one. </p>
	<p class="block29">The door was heavier than I expected, solid. It caught me off guard. I could feel the ladder wobble beneath me as I changed position to ease the door downward until it hung from its hinges. Beads of sweat formed on my forehead and ran into my eyes despite the cool night air. </p>
	<p class="block29">Managing to keep my balance, I climbed upward into the dark opening above me. </p>
	<p class="block29">At the top of the ladder, I hesitated, listening for the noises I’d heard while lying in bed. I grabbed the flashlight from my pocket and wasn’t impressed by what I saw.</p>
	<p class="block29">Thick black cobwebs hung from dusty rafters like mourning lace. I pulled myself up through the square hole and sat with my legs dangling. It was cold, no insulation. I shone the flashlight around taking in the red brick chimneybreast with its flaking mortar, the wormy rafters and yellow rows of roof tiles. The attic was mostly empty apart from a jumbled pyramid of old tea chests. I stood up, being careful not to catch my head on the sloping beams and moved from joist to joist, taking care not to tread in between for fear of putting my foot through the bedroom ceiling below me. </p>
	<p class="block29">The stack of tea chests held a treasure trove of personal items I guessed had belonged to Tina’s grandmother. There were framed photographs thick with dust, a silver teapot, china plates, all manner of bric-a-brac. I handled each piece carefully, examining them in the beam of the flashlight. Halfway down one crate, I discovered a brown parcel and lifted it out, blowing dust off its cover. I’d completely forgotten why I was up there in the first place. I opened the package and pulled out an exquisite wedding gown. It was the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen. I shook out the creases and held it against me, holding one sleeve in my hand as if about to dance with it.</p>
	<p class="block29">I closed my eyes and, for a moment imagined, I could smell perfume. Lily of the valley, a woman’s voice whispered in my ear. The dress began to fill out beneath my arms, to take on a most pleasing shape. As it swelled and took form, so ‘little John’ began to swell and strain in my jeans. My breathing slowed and before I knew it, I was dancing.</p>
	<p class="block29">“John? John. Oh my god, what are you doing.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Tina’s top half stared at me from the trapdoor opening. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Wait, it’s not what you…” I got no further. By my side, a withered face grinned at me. A corpse in a wedding dress. I pushed it away and turned toward Tina but she was descending the ladder, closing the trapdoor behind her. How she found the strength, I do not know but I heard the bolts sliding back into place leaving me trapped in the attic with her dead grandmother. </p>
	<p class="block29">“She’s not good enough for you, John. Let me show you what a real woman can do.”</p>
	<p class="block29">The words crackled from grandmother’s desiccated lips in a cloud of dust like spores escaping a puffball.</p>
	<p class="block29">Panic knotted my stomach. My hard-on shrank as swiftly as it had stirred. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Tina,” I screamed the words turning away from the shriveled husk as it advanced towards me. I stepped face first into a hanging web and it enveloped my face like a shroud making me gasp, sucking its filthy blackness into my mouth. Blindly I stumbled forward and felt the floor give way beneath me, ancient lath and plaster disintegrating beneath my weight.</p>
	<p class="block29">I fell a long way into darkness and then finally hit something soft and bounced.</p>
	<p class="block29">Frantically I wiped at my face, trying to pull away the filthy spider web but there was nothing there.</p>
	<p class="block29">I felt Tina’s hand slide over and grab my arm beneath the duvet. </p>
	<p class="block29">“John, what the fuck is that?” she whispered urgently.</p>
	<p class="block29">Laying there in the bed, I listened to the skittering, sliding noises coming from right over my head. </p>
