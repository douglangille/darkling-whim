	<p class="block28">A THICK MIST hung heavy in the late night air. Aldrich, an immensely tall, dignified man, along with Bromartin and Cedric, held their torches low to see the uneven ground. Flanked by Bladwin, Tomkins and Roberts, the men sought the source of the woman’s screams. The noise had been so startling it woke the villagers from their sleep. </p>
	<p class="block29">Armed with bows, arrows, belt daggers, boot knifes, and torches, each man moved forward cautiously. The woman’s screams were nerve-shattering. Unfazed, the men continued on towards the source. They covered five newly-plowed fields and knew the wide meadow ahead led to the forest beyond. </p>
	<p class="block29">Torches held low to see if any large creature had flattened the pasture’s grass, they proceeded in this manner for one hundred paces. Aldrich stopped and lifted his torch. In the distance he could see the forest’s foreboding outline. </p>
	<p class="block29">Aldrich and his men took deep breaths and entered its blackness. </p>
	<p class="block29">As they drew nearer to the source, the screams faded. Concerned, the men stopped to light their second torches. Blessing themselves, they called upon God to protect them. </p>
	<p class="block29">They counted the paces, their senses tortured by the stillness. The men knew the forest’s sounds, save this night for a faint muffled scream. Through the mist they saw the massive oak’s outline, and from behind it, the source of the screams. </p>
	<p class="block29">Aldrich motioned Roberts and Cedric to guard the front of the immense tree, while he and the remaining men would approach the back of the tree from either side. With Aldrich holding his torch and boot knife, they ventured forward. Movements precise; every step held to listen, they continued in this manner until they reached the backside of the huge oak. What they saw terrified and puzzled them. </p>
	<p class="block29">“By the Lord Almighty Jesus Christ, this cannot be,” Aldrich said. Next to a new born-babe lay a young woman. The only time they had witnessed this type of barbarity was during the crusade. Aldrich studied the mutilated woman. <i class="calibre6">Who has done this to her? By all that is holy, it must be the act of a depraved individual.</i> </p>
	<p class="block29">Aldrich lowered his torch and immediately noticed her finger nails had been ripped from her cut off fingers. He held the torch only to see her head upon her gutted stomach. </p>
	<p class="block29">Cedric and Roberts came from the front of the tree, and upon seeing the naked young lady, made the sign of the cross. “Aldrich, is this the devil’s work?” </p>
	<p class="block29">“I think not, Cedric, look closer.” </p>
	<p class="block29">The woman’s eyes had been gouged out and her nose, ears and breasts cut off. Even with the mutilations they knew it was the young woman with child that went missing from the village three days past. Bromartin knelt next to the corpse. “The midwives said Adenia was soon to give birth.” He traced the sign of the cross on her forehead. “Adenia, you did not deserve this fate. This is not the work of the Devil, Cedric and Roberts, but of a man with a heart as black as pitch.” </p>
	<p class="block29">Bromartin moved the torch down over her body until all could see that her legs had been broken and her toes had suffered the same fate as her fingers. Next to her feet lay one deep depression, not a cloven hoof or a three-toed impression, only one large circular mark that led nowhere. </p>
	<p class="block29">“But what of the baby?” Tomkins asked. </p>
	<p class="block29">Aldrich moved toward the small form and knelt to lift the babe. Its lips and mouth deeply stained, the baby barely moved. Aldrich shoved the end of the torch into the soft earth then brought the baby to his body. Looking at Adenia, he sheathed his boot knife then gathered her torn clothing to wrap the baby. He was about to lift the torch when he and the men heard a muffled groan followed by the sound of breaking twigs. Aldrich placed the baby gently on the ground behind him. He unslung his bow and quickly notched an arrow. The noises continued, but drew no closer, staying out of the torches’ reach. With a nod of his head, six arrows flew, producing a loud sucking sound, the signal they had struck something soft. The noise seemed to draw closer. Within mere seconds six more arrows disappeared into the darkness. </p>
	<p class="block29">They heard the same sucking sounds. The men’s arrows were notched again, but did not leave their bows. The noises had ceased. </p>
	<p class="block29">Confusion overrode fear as Bladwin, Tomkins and Bromartin moved toward the noise’s source. Torches waist high, they came upon small piles of black sulfur powder and several large circular prints, but nothing more. They returned to the other men and told of what they had found. </p>
	<p class="block29">“If it bleeds sulfur, we can kill it,” Bromartin said. </p>
	<p class="block29">His bow slung over his back, Aldrich reached down and picked up the baby. He loosened the torch from the ground and joined the others working their way back through the mist. They lit their last torch and returned to the village following the path they had walked on earlier. </p>
	<p class="block29">Aldrich held the baby tightly to give it warmth. <i class="calibre6">We must make our way back to the village with this poor babe. Once Adenia’s husband and parents have the child, we shall mount a search to show the elders what we discovered under the great oak.</i> He looked down at the babe and smiled. “I have seen far too much death and butchery this night. Soon you will be with those who love you.” </p>
	<p class="block29">The mist remained dense limiting their vision to just a few, the torches barely helped to make headway on their return to the village. They stopped momentarily to make the sign of the cross. </p>
	<p class="block29">The babe stirred in the makeshift swaddling, yet did not cry out. In the distance he and the men heard faint voices, but could not quicken their pace due the uneven nature of the freshly plowed fields. </p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block"> </p>
	<p class="block28">At the massive oak, a shadow form returned to the corpse and consumed the flesh until only bone and hair remained. It slowly pulled out the arrows from its hideous form sniffing each one to identify their source. Not seeing the baby, it made a low guttural sound. The humans had taken the bait. When the baby awakens, I will know everything about the hamlet. The beast then vanished into the heavy mist. </p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block"> </p>
	<p class="block28">At the village’s outskirts the men saw bobbing torches approaching them. Soon the village elders had the men and the baby within the large meeting hall. Torches extinguished, the elders, mid-wives and wet nurses fussed over the baby. In the building were Adenia’s husband and parents. Aldrich and Bromartin knew of no better way to tell them what they had found. Amidst the cries of anguish and sorrow, Aldrich vowed to bring her body back by the morn. </p>
	<p class="block29">Satisfied, all focused on the babe. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Well done men,” praised head village elder, Cravis. “As you said we will leave at the sun’s rising this day. The six of you will take me and village elders, Palken and Abrakos, along with flaxen bags to bring back the remains. We will travel to the great oak to see for ourselves what you and the men explained this night.” </p>
	<p class="block33">So they come to gather the corpse. A confused lot they shall be upon finding only bone and hair. I shall watch unseen. The village of Dankforth will I ravage without pity. Once I have devastated the hamlet, I shall move on to the next wretched settlement three crusaders inhabit. Time is my ally, and for the poor wretched crusaders of this doomed village, their nemesis. </p>
	<p class="block29">The sun rose, and the mist gradually disappeared. Aldrich and the five men rode their horses accompanied by Dankforth’s elders, Clovis, Abrakos and Palken. </p>
	<p class="block29">They arrived at the enormous tree; the men dismounted and tethered their horses to the nearest undergrowth. Arrows notched on their bowstrings, they slowly approached the far side of the tree expecting to find the young woman’s mutilated body. “I do not understand?” said Bromartin, a tall, balding man of sinewy build. “What remains are only bits of bone and hair. What happened to the body, Aldrich?” </p>
	<p class="block29">“I cannot tell you my friend. This I did not expect.” </p>
	<p class="block29">“What type of funeral can we give Adenia with these pitiful remains?” Clovis asked. </p>
	<p class="block29">“We know of no animal that could devour a human in one sitting,” said Roberts tightly. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Whatever foul manner of this creature be, it is a beast unfamiliar to our experiences. We have seen and witnessed many a strange sight during our journey to Jerusalem, but nothing like this,” Aldrich replied. </p>
	<p class="block29">“This night past we struck something twelve times until it was silenced. We made toward it only to find many small piles of sulfur and several large round tracks that led nowhere. I know not what we face,” Roberts said. “Whatever this ungodly creature be, it possesses supernatural strength to have ripped off Adenia’s head and survive twelve arrow strikes.” </p>
	<p class="block29">“We must have hurt the creature, for all we heard were sucking noises.” He paused, “but what say you, Cedric, to what I found beyond the oak?” Tomkins, a short, heavy-set man with a barrel chest, threw down twelve broken arrows, all covered with a faint black powder up to their fletching. “Not only did this creature break the arrows, but it escaped into the night.” </p>
	<p class="block29">“No!” Aldrich said. “Our arrows hurt the beast or it would not have retreated after the second volley. Instead of red blood, it bleeds black sulfur.” </p>
	<p class="block29">“Aye,” added Bladwin, “though it possesses enormous strength to pull out our arrows. We hurt it that it could not press home its attack.” </p>
	<p class="block29">“I agree with Bladwin,” Bromartin said, “the six of us placed twelve arrows into it which would have brought a wolf or bear to its knees.” Bromartin looked about until his eyes fell upon Roberts. “And what say you, Roberts?” </p>
	<p class="block29">Roberts, with the same build as Aldrich except having flowing black hair streaked with gray, spoke: “I doubt not what Aldrich or my friends said this mourn. If this beast does its bidding under the stars in the mist, how can we destroy such a creature if we cannot see it? The blood oath the six of us swore to the village elders to be Dankforth’s protector is binding. This thing, be it from hell, or the spirit world, we are honor-bound to destroy this abomination.” </p>
	<p class="block29">Clovis looked sternly at Aldrich. “Of this,” he gestured toward what little remained the body, “what further evidence have you found?” </p>
	<p class="block29">“Several piles of black sulfur where our arrows wounded the beast along with several tracks the likes we have never seen.” Aldrich said. “I and my men will search for more signs of Adenia while you and the elders bring her remains back to the church for proper burial.” </p>
	<p class="block29">Satisfied, Clovis and the two elders gathered the bits of bone and hair and returned to the village. </p>
	<p class="block29">“This thing we must hunt, Aldrich,” Roberts said. “Along with our bows, I would feel much safer with spears and swords over daggers and boot knives.” </p>
	<p class="block29">“It shall be as you request. Each quiver will hold our arrows and with my sword I will keep my dagger and boot knife to be used against the creature.” </p>
	<p class="block29">“And I shall do the same, Aldrich,” Bromartin agreed. “Better to have as many weapons against what we must find and kill.” </p>
	<p class="block34">The men spoke in unison, pledging they would follow Aldrich’s commands. </p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block"> </p>
	<p class="block28">In the meeting hall the midwives had cleaned the baby but were unable to remove the stain about its mouth. Finished, they wrapped it in swaddling clothes so the wet nurses could take turns feeding the baby. The child looked healthy. The wet nurses remarked at the young babe’s appetite and its ability to seemingly focus its dark brown eyes on the faces of those feeding and caring for him. A few of the women felt uncomfortable with this: it was if the baby was trying to read their thoughts. Aside from this, the baby acted normal, sleeping, eating and soiling undergarments as any newborn would. </p>
	<p class="block33">They seem to adore you, Borech. You have them fooled and off guard. Well done for a fortnight, but beware those who now search my tracks. They are suspicious of what they found in the forest and are determined to track through it to kill me. </p>
	<p class="block33">They will never catch you, Yuugoth my mother, before my transformation. Then I shall help you defeat these pitiful souls then dine upon their lifeless forms. </p>
	<p class="block29"><i class="calibre6">My child, the man they address as Aldrich had returned from the crusades with his companions, spilling much Saracen blood. It is said upon their trip home their arrows and swords were blessed by the Pope. These men are warriors and are loyal to a fault. This village may not be the ripe pickings of past settlements we sated our appetites on during our travels. My senses tell me their meat shall give us powers we have not felt for a long time. The village of Dankforth is a dish we cannot refuse.</i> </p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block"> </p>
	<p class="block28">Aldrich strode into the main hall. “Elder Clovis, we have found nothing more of Adenia, only more tracks of the beast leading deeper into the forest toward the old Roman fortress of Praxisnorum. We will eat then return to track the beast. If we do not return by tomorrow morn, you are to dispatch riders to the villages to our north and west by midday.” </p>
	<p class="block29">“We shall, Aldrich. Though they ride plough horses and those that pull Forney carts, they have made the journeys before. They are familiar with the road’s features as they are known by the villagers.” </p>
	<p class="block29">“Elder Clovis, we will require six torches for each man and a horse to carry food and water for the hunt. Will this present a problem for the elders?” </p>
	<p class="block29">“No, Aldrich. You shall have what you require.” </p>
	<p class="block29">“Many thanks, elder Clovis. We will look for tracks today before we return to the village. Before sunrise on the morrow, we shall depart to track the beast. All of us are eager for the chase.” Aldrich turned to face his men. “We will not turn back until we have killed the creature. Remember well all signs so we can add them to the map that hangs in the meeting hall.” </p>
	<p class="block29">Aldrich turned to face Bromartin and the men. “We now track the beast. Do not let the creature’s markings escape your memories.” </p>
	<p class="block29">“The track we found next to the corpse, we found many that retreat from where we wounded it. All head east,” Bromartin said. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Aye, they do,” Tomkins replied, “but they appear larger than the first tracks.” </p>
	<p class="block29">“Their gait is wider so it travels faster,” said Roberts. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Cedric and Bladwin you eyed the tracks, what say you?” Aldrich said. </p>
	<p class="block29">“We agree with Roberts, Aldrich,” Tomkins said. “Besides the longer gait, the tracks settle deeper than those first witnessed.” </p>
	<p class="block29">“By what we know of the tracks, this is a beast which has never been revealed to any man,” Bromartin said.</p>
	<p class="block29">“All the more reason we track and kill it. From deep within my soul I feel it is evil,” Tomkins added. </p>
	<p class="block29">They tracked the beast that morn and part of the midday until Aldrich’s head ached with foreign thoughts. As he turned to ask Bromartin or Roberts to take the lead, he saw his men shaking their heads. It is as I feared, the closer we draw to this abomination the more it fills our heads with doubt and despair. With considerable effort Aldrich told his men to return the way they came. </p>
	<p class="block29">The men retreated until the feelings vanished. </p>
	<p class="block29">“What foul thing played with our thoughts?” asked Cedric. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Yet it did not play with our wits,” Aldrich said calmly. “We were blessed by the Pope to fight evil no matter what form. Though we escaped the creature’s grip, it unwittingly told me the babe in our village is as evil as the creature we hunted. We must make toward our horses.” </p>
	<p class="block29">As they neared their horses, a gasping Tomkins spoke. “Aye, I felt it too. Aldrich, its evil is growing within the forest. It must be destroyed, for we now know it is under the beast’s control.” </p>
	<p class="block29">Cedric agreed. “As the creature becomes stronger it affects the child.” </p>
	<p class="block29">“We must kill the baby,” Aldrich added. “We all must be of one mind as we enter the village.” </p>
	<p class="block29">A chorus of ‘Ayes’ followed. They had taken their horses far into the woods before dismounting. The sudden, intense image of Dankforth burning filled their minds. Each man looked at the other and nodded in agreement before running towards their steeds as if pursued by banshees. </p>
	<p class="block29">Once they reached their horses, each man, exhausted, took a knee and drank water from their goatskin bags. Their thirst sated, they mounted their horses. The men made their way through the forest until they reached open ground, where they began a mad dash to Dankforth. </p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block"> </p>
	<p class="block35">They tracked me into the forest to destroy me. My attempt to control their minds proved useless. You must begin the changing before the men arrive so you can kill what villagers you find. This will leave the village for us to ravage and feed upon. Do the women suspect you? </p>
	<p class="block33">No, Yuugoth. They suspect nothing as they fuss and care over me as if I was one of their own, but I do not have the strength to do so. </p>
	<p class="block33">You must! Aldrich and his men suspect otherwise. They retreat towards their horses. You must change as the sun sets, for by early morn they will arrive to crush you. </p>
	<p class="block33">If I transform now, it births a creature strong enough to kill the woman, but beyond this, I promise nothing. </p>
	<p class="block33">Release your evil, and let the beast loose to devour those in the hall. Once done, I will follow the horsemen’s path to Dankforth. </p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block"> </p>
	<p class="block28">Bladwin was the first to notice a thin black column of smoke coming from Dankforth as night lifted, and he alerted the weary men. Aldrich looked into Bladwin’s tired eyes and nodded. Without a spoken word they spurred their steeds towards the village. Though each man’s thoughts private, all knew instinctively it was the baby. </p>
	<p class="block29">Within the hall, a black impenetrable mist had enveloped the baby and expanded slowly until it was larger than any man. As the mist cleared, it revealed the unrecognizable remains of the wet nurse. The creature had a large cat-like head with saber teeth that glowed bright red. The same red outlined the large eye as black as the mist whence it came. The creature was outlined in broken patterns of red with paws showing long sharp claws. Its tail, nearly the length of its body ended with long red blades. From its large mouth came a low, vibrating guttural sound. </p>
	<p class="block29">The three women in the hall tried to escape, but the creature was upon them. In the brief, futile struggle for life, lit candles were knocked over, starting a fire that spread quickly over the dry wood. </p>
	<p class="block29">The villagers, after a hard struggle, managed to keep the fire from spreading. Exhausted, skin and clothing covered with black-gray ash, they watched in horror as the creature slowly emerged from the rubble. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Quickly, to the church!” the village’s elders shouted. </p>
	<p class="block29">The creature snarled, but did not press the attack. Sounds of anguish, fear and confusion mixed with the strong shouts for able-bodied men to grab pikes. </p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block"> </p>
	<p class="block35">Yuugoth, you did not tell me this insignificant hamlet had a house of God or men with long, pointed weapons. </p>
	<p class="block33">They matter not. I now follow those who sought me. With the horsemen you must use caution; the arrows they carry can be deadly. Burn all the buildings, and kill all those not inside the church. </p>
	<p class="block33">Why cannot I destroy the church and ravage those within? </p>
	<p class="block33">Patience, Borech. You may have them after I have had my way with the horsemen. I shall enjoy flaying their skin as I listen to their agonized screams. Now go and satisfy your blood lust. </p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block"> </p>
	<p class="block28">Horses foaming at the mouth, Aldrich tasked the others to keep pace. </p>
	<p class="block29">Roberts first noticed the smoke was contained to one area of the village until he saw smaller plumes from different locations. He spurred on his horse until he was even with Aldrich. “It appears more of the village burns, Aldrich.” </p>
	<p class="block29">Aldrich pulled on the reigns. Puzzled, confused looks covered their faces as they circled him nervously. “Whatever is burning our village will expect us to ride directly into Dankforth. We shall enter from the back and put our arrows into the beast. Bromartin, Roberts and Tomkins, you will approach the village from the blacksmith’s stable while Cedric and Bladwin approach from behind the church. I will enter by the main road. All arrows are to be strung. If you disagree, now is the time to speak.” </p>
	<p class="block29">Bromartin spoke first. “Your words tell us you have experienced this before, Aldrich?” </p>
	<p class="block29">“When I was separated from you near Jerusalem, I encountered three settlements that suffered the fate which besieges our village. At first I thought it the work of bandits, or, as we were near Jerusalem, the much hated Characins. To my fear and disbelief, we found the villages inhabitants burned in a barbaric manner. In all my fighting with you my friends, this I had never witnessed. All the buildings were burned lest the village had a house of God. Inside these structures we found people who had starved to death, yet we found no means to keep them in. They appeared to choose the sanctuary of God and a slow and agonizing death to what lay outside.” </p>
	<p class="block29">“By the heavens,” Cedric said, “we must approach the village with great haste before all are lost!” </p>
	<p class="block29">“Aye, I agree!” Roberts shouted. “The longer we delay, the more villagers will perish!” </p>
	<p class="block29">“And we shall, as planned,” Aldrich reassured. “Remember, the men in the village are armed with pikes. If they fight it may help us. Our only hope is our people have made it to the church. NOW RIDE AND STRIKE AS PLANNED.” </p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block"> </p>
	<p class="block35">Yuugoth, our prey have long sharp poles that wounded me thrice. The remaining quarry escaped into the church. I tried to enter but was hurled back several lengths. It is cursed. </p>
	<p class="block33">Patience, Borech, holy water must be present. Search the remaining village, and kill all things living. When done, burn everything to the ground. Be quick about your task for the riders approach. </p>
	<p class="block33">As you wish, Yuugoth, but my wounds burn deep. </p>
	<p class="block33">All the more reason, my son, to release your vengeance upon the village until I arrive to sup upon their bones. </p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block"> </p>
	<p class="block28">Aldrich stopped. “We will dismount here and enter the village as planned. You will be of no use if thrown from your horse. Do not be afraid of what you see. It can, and will, be killed by our arrows. Now go, and may God be with you.” </p>
	<p class="block29">As Aldrich planned, Bromartin was the first to dismount, followed by Tomkins, and Roberts. Two body lengths apart, bows at the ready, they moved forward. Tomkins whispered he smelled sulfur. Bromartin and Roberts nodded and slowly pushed forward. </p>
	<p class="block29">Cedric and Bladwin noticed the horses in the stable were pushing against the wooden gate. Bladwin opened it, and the horses bolted. The stench of sulfur offended their senses. Bows taught they quietly moved forward, but heard nothing save the sound of crackling embers. </p>
	<p class="block29">Three buildings distant they caught a fleeting glimpse of a dark creature. Cedric and Bladwin looked at each other as they made the sign of the cross. Senses alive, they proceeded, back-to-back, down the street that led to the village green. </p>
	<p class="block29">Dismounted, Aldrich brazenly entered the village and challenged the creature to show itself. </p>
	<p class="block29">As he did this, Bromartin, Roberts and Tomkins moved slowly forward. The reek of sulfur amidst the crumbled, smoking ruins became stronger. From the burnt structures, the creature pounced on Tomkins and tore at his flesh. Stunned momentarily, Tomkins screams brought Roberts and Bromartin to action. Within moments, each unleashed three arrows. The creature let out a hideous shriek then bounded away. They rushed to Tomkins side only to hear him whisper, “Take care of my family,” as the life drained from his mauled body. </p>
	<p class="block29">Cedric and Bladwin did not hear the ruckus and continued their search, the smell of sulfur fading, until they reached the burnt shell of the village’s hall. Here they stopped and listened. They heard the sounds of crumbling structures, but nothing more as they made their way towards the village green. </p>
	<p class="block29">The sulfur smell was overpowering. Cedric turned to his right and saw the tale of the beast disappear behind an untouched building. He touched Bladwin’s shoulder and motioned that the creature was trying to flank them. Without hesitation, they ran to the village green and waited. </p>
	<p class="block29">Aldrich continued to hurl insults at the beast until he approached the green. Cedric and Bladwin, hearing his voice, shouted until Aldrich acknowledged their location. </p>
	<p class="block29">Bromartin and Roberts heard the faint voices. With silenced caution, they made their way towards the others. Four buildings from the green, the odious <span id="id_GoBack">smell of sulfur caused them to wince. An ear-splitting roar and the creature emerged fifteen paces from them. Seeing Tomkins‘s lifeless body, their bows let loose, Robert’s arrow striking the beast just below its large black eye while Bromartin’s hit the chest. The men let loose another volley striking the creature in the shoulder and neck. The creature shrieked and ran towards the village green. </span></p>

	<p class="block35">Yuugoth, the wounds I suffer drain my strength. I no longer have the power to burn. The horsemen hunt me like a common creature. I have killed one, but their projectiles repelled me from killing more. I must hide to regain strength or I shall die. </p>
	<p class="block33">Borech, you must remain strong. Go back to the slain horsemen and devour everything. This will give you the strength you seek. </p>
	<p class="block33">I am losing black mist. I will seek out the dead meat and consume it before I kill the horsemen. </p>
	<p class="block33">No! You must wait for my arrival. Together we will smite all. </p>
	<p class="block33">My pain is great Yuugoth! After I devour the meat, I shall butcher them and drink their blood. </p>
	<p class="block33">Borech, my child, you must listen to me. You must wait. </p>
	<p class="block33">For them to hunt me? NO. I will kill and devour them! </p>

	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block28">On the village green, the five men formed a circle and waited for the creature to strike. </p>
	<p class="block29">“The smell of sulfur is weak, Aldrich. We must fetch Tomkins and bring him to us,” Bromartin said. </p>
	<p class="block29">“I agree, before this ungodly thing devours him. Cedric, Bladwin and Roberts, you are to remain here and watch for the creature while Bromartin and I retrieve Tomkins.” Aldrich looked about. “Fortunately, the green will keep the fires from spreading. Our arrival must have stopped the beast from doing its bidding. Keep sharp, and may God be with us.” </p>
	<p class="block29">Both left the green and headed for the narrow street where Tomkins lay. The buildings, having burned fiercely, were now smoldering skeletons and crumbled heaps amidst a blanket of smoke-filled haze. Side-by-side, bows drawn, they slowly moved forward until Bromartin saw the creature’s outline atop Tomkins’s body. </p>
	<p class="block29">His arrow struck true as did Aldrich’s. Within seconds, the creature approached and lashed out at Bromartin with its scythe-like tale, severing his head. Briefly stunned, Aldrich let loose three arrows in rapid succession that struck the creature’s head, causing it great agony. Aldrich realized he could do nothing for his friend and backed out toward the green as the beast clawed at the arrows. </p>
	<p class="block29">He joined Roberts, Bladwin and Cedric. They heard the beast draw near. As it cleared the lane, they saw it oozed black mist. Barely fifteen paces from the men it paced slowly back and forth until it stopped, its huge red-lined black eye fixated on its prey. </p>
	<p class="block29">Sweat drenched their clothing. They faced many dangers during the crusade, but nothing this evil. Aldrich spoke, his words low and precise. “It is set to charge. Aim for the eye. Should it turn sideways, step back and beware its tale as it took Bromartin’s head as you would knock a pumpkin from a pole. Let your arrows be true and strike the creature until it dies.” </p>
	<p class="block29">“Blessed Mother of Christ, what is it we face, Aldrich?” Cedric whispered. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Aye, it bleeds black sulfur as did the creature in the forest,” added Bladwin. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Pray tell us what we face, Aldrich?” asked Roberts. </p>
	<p class="block29">The cat-like creature paced to and fro as it looked for a weak spot to strike. It focused on Cedric and bound towards him only to have four arrows pierce its eye. Its’ momentum carried it into Cedric knocking him to the ground, its dead weight crushing him. The remaining three men let loose two volleys of arrows to ensure its death. The black mist drained from its still body until nothing remained but its grotesque skeleton atop Cedric. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Roberts, Bladwin, instruct the village elders to oversee those in the church to gather haste all manner of food and water before they return to it. Tell the pike men to join us on the green. We will need their weapons to fight what comes.” </p>
	<p class="block29">“Before we fight, what did we slay, Aldrich, at the price of three of our crusader brothers?” Cedric asked. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Do first as I ask thee, my brothers, and I will tell you and the pike men.” </p>
	<p class="block29">Roberts looked at Bladwin who gave a brief nod. “Fair enough, Aldrich. We can wait till then.” </p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block"> </p>
	<p class="block35">Borech, answer me! I must know of your condition and that of the hamlet I approach. Borech, I must know. After several attempts, Yuugoth realized Borech was dead. Rage, denial and utter disbelief filled her. Why did not the villagers fear Borech? What breed of men are these, that no village could kill before? No matter, they shall feel my full wrath and vengeance as I pull the bones from their bodies and drink their blood. </p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>

	<p class="block24"> </p>
	<p class="block28">As the villagers continued to store food and water in the church, Aldrich knelt and took stock of the men about him. Aside from Roberts and Bladwin, from the fifteen pike men, only two remained. They were joined by the four village’s four huntsman. Unsure only eleven men could kill what approached, he began his explanation. </p>
	<p class="block29">“When I was separated from you, my brothers, I was with a French scouting party. We came upon a village without church or other building of worship. All that remained were burnt corpses and charred piles wood. Later that day we captured seven Characins who told of the creature which lies upon poor Cedric. This thing was under the spell of an evil, a one-eyed, clawed cloud-mist that even the evil Muslim Jiins avoided. This knowledge they gave freely, telling us it was controlled by a Characin sorcerer called, Akbarmun. They told us it sacked numerous Muslim towns, until the sorcerer was killed by a crusader which freed the beast.” </p>
	<p class="block29">“But why us?” interjected Roberts. </p>
	<p class="block29">“And why now, Aldrich?” Bladwin added, his voice tainted with uncertainly. </p>
	<p class="block29">“It hunts those who fought against the Characins and killed its master. Look about you. Our village had ten plus seven which heeded the call to arms. Of those, only five remain; you, Bladwin, me and the two pike men, Jameson and Wainforth. The Characins said what approached would be pure evil.” </p>
	<p class="block29">Wainforth spoke with measured courage. “Those of us who dipped the heads of our pikes in holy water found they penetrated the thing wounding it.” </p>
	<p class="block29">“Our arrows killed,” said Roberts, “because they were blessed by the Pope. Now, with our blessed arrows spent, we must dip our remaining arrows in holy water. Our swords need not holy water as they were blessed. All arrow heads, knives and daggers, including those of our slain comrades, are to be dipped into the holy water as Jameson and Wainforth did with their pikes. We must do this now so we can plan our strategy.” </p>

	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block28">Yuugoth made its way from the forest and into the open meadows before the village’s plowed fields. They await my coming. <i class="calibre6">I shall enter where Borech’s bones remain and splinter their bones and eat their marrow. They are a feeble lot which I shall slay with great pleasure. </i></p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block28">The villagers safely in the church, Aldrich’s plan was acted upon. The pike men would stand guard at the church’s locked door. Roberts, with two huntsmen, would take position at the southern entrance to the green. Bladwin and a huntsman would guard the northern approach. Aldrich, along with the last huntsman, would lie in wait between the stable and blacksmith’s area. </p>
	<p class="block29">The wind started as a soft caressing of one’s cheek only to be followed an intense sulfur-laden smell. Aldrich and the huntsman were the first to see the cloud-like body enter the village from the east and make for the town’s green where Roberts and the huntsman stood guard. </p>
	<p class="block29">Aldrich and the huntsman circled around the village’s outskirts. They slowly gained ground until he heard Roberts’s shouts. </p>
	<p class="block29">Aldrich and the huntsman moved forward and saw the creature gradually make its way toward Robert’s position. </p>
	<p class="block29">Roberts and the huntsmen let their arrows fly only to see them disappear into the cloud. At that moment, Aldrich and his huntsman let loose their arrows with the same results. Bladwin and his huntsman fired two volleys into it only to see their arrows vanish as well. </p>
	<p class="block29">The creature groaned as more arrows found their mark. Enraged it made towards Roberts’s position only to feel two deep, burning probes enter its side from the pike men. Infuriated, it swung its arm-like vestige at both men, cutting them in half. </p>
	<p class="block29">As it turned it exposed its great eye, which Roberts and two huntsmen struck with ease. </p>
	<p class="block29">Its pain unbearable, it charged the men as three arrows penetrated just below the eye. Within seconds it enveloped the men. Roberts plunged his sword into the cloud. The muffled screams enraged Aldrich. </p>
	<p class="block29">Bladwin and Aldrich, with the remaining huntsmen, ran from the green to the village’s only two story dwelling. </p>
	<p class="block29">Yuugoth saw this and made for them. </p>
	<p class="block29">From the top windows they could see the cloud was rapidly losing its black mist. </p>
	<p class="block29">“We must aim for the eye to kill it,” Aldrich commanded. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Between us we have nine arrows, Aldrich,” said the taller of the huntsmen. </p>
	<p class="block29">“I have three,’ Bladwin said. </p>
	<p class="block29">“And I five,” said Aldrich. </p>
	<p class="block29">There was a tremendous shriek. The creature’s eye, now no more than thirty paces from the building, moved towards the men. On Aldrich’s command, they let loose their arrows, each striking the creature’s eye which poured black sulfur. With one final effort, the creature crashed into the building, knocking it down. </p>
	<p class="block29">Upon seeing this, the village elders opened the church doors and raced toward the building to look for survivors. There was movement. It was the huntsman Bryce. They carefully lifted him from the debris and laid him on the village green. Though he had a broken arm and leg, and cuts to his face and arms, the elders knew he would survive. </p>
	<p class="block29">More digging and another body stirred. It was the huntsman, Mangroth. He was in a bad way: two broken legs, a broken wrist and a long gash across his back. He too was carried to the green and laid next to Bryce. </p>
	<p class="block29">After more digging they found the still bodies of Aldrich and Roberts. To the villagers’ confusion, neither man was marked. It was though they would sit up at any moment and talk. In their hands were boot knives and daggers covered with in sulfur. </p>
	<p class="block29">Three days later, all which helped kill both beasts were laid to rest in a section of the cemetery consecrated for the heroes of the Battle of Dankforth.</p>
