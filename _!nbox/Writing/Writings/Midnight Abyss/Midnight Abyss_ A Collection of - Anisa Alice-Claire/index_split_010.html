	<p class="block20">Matthew X. Gomez</p>
	<p class="block"> </p>
	<p class="block"> </p>
	<p class="block21">Matthew was born and raised in the suburbs of New York City, though he now inexplicably finds himself much further south than he ever anticipated. Now he lives in Columbia, Maryland, with his wife, two children, and two cats. He has been writing for forever, getting his real start writing for a number of student run publications in high school and college. He has been previously published by Death Throes and Dark Futures, and his work can frequently be encountered at writerscarnival.ca.<span class="calibre3">  </span>He possesses a number of esoteric skills, not the least being fencing and historic swordplay, which, if he weren’t a writer, would be pretty useless. Matthew hopes to have an anthology of his own short stories out in 2014.</p>

	<p class="block28">THE MAN WALKING<span class="calibre3"> down the dirt road kicked up dust with every step, a cloud of brown hovering over him.  His eyes were locked straight ahead, focused on the ramshackle shack in front of him. The wood of the shack was the same pervasive brown as the dirt surrounding it. He could hear the creak of a rocking chair, the plucking of a guitar carried by the wind. A bobcat’s skull </span>hung over the door.</p>
	<p class="block29">“You Jeb Johnson?” the walker asked, his hand dropping to the six-gun in his belt.</p>
	<p class="block29">The man in the chair looked up. His ‘face’ didn’t belong to him, stolen from some poor soul and nailed to his skull. Probably from the last one that came out this way. Judging from the horns sticking up through the pale leather, whatever was under the mask wasn’t human.</p>
	<p class="block29">“I’ve been called that at times,” the thing sitting in the chair said. With yellowed claws, it continued plucking at the guitar which was stained a deep dark red from old spilled blood. The strings shone silver in the harsh desert sun. The skull of the bobcat turned slowly, opening its mouth to show nothing but blackness behind.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Easy there, Silas,” the guitar player said. “He ain’t here to do more than talk, ain’t that right, Warren Jacobs? You obviously know who I am, what I am, and you knew where to find me. So you’ve got some smarts. And you stopped to ask my name, even though you know what I am, so you’re polite. You’ve got two things going for you right there. So, the question is, what is it you want from me?” The thing in the chair leaned forward, setting the guitar to one side. “What can old Jeb do for you?” </p>
	<p class="block29">“I want revenge,” Warren replied. “Rufus Killane and his gang, well, they killed my wife and daughter. They burned my home to the ground.” He took his hat off, flipped his hair back to show the ruin where his right eye should have been. “Left me for dead. Well, I’m not dead yet.”</p>
	<p class="block29">The thing called Jeb spat into the dust where it sizzled and ate into the ground. “You’ve got a gun. You’re motivated. Don’t see as you need much more.” </p>
	<p class="block29">Warren laughed, harsh and hard. “I’m one man. Killane runs with nine others, all just as hard as him, and all of them steeped in sin.” </p>
	<p class="block29">“And if I told you I was mighty fond of sin? That Rufus and his ilk were like children when compared to me? That I’d be more likely to gut you and feast on your liver than help you? What would you say then, Mister Jacobs? Would you take your fancy pistol and see about putting an end to me?” </p>
	<p class="block29">Warren placed his hat back on his head. “I reckon I’d just as well be pissing in the wind than trying to kill you. I would tell you I’d be in your debt and would sorely owe you.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Jeb ran a crooked, cracked claw under his human mask and scratched the flesh underneath with a sound like flint rubbing sandstone. “My debt, huh? I hate collecting those. One of the reasons why I moved out this way in the first place. Can’t you do better?”</p>
	<p class="block29">Warren kicked his feet in the dust. “Not sure I’ve got more to offer. I’ve my gun, and the clothes on my back, but that’s about it. What more would you want anyway?” </p>
	<p class="block29">Jeb smiled, a truly horrible sight. The teeth in his mouth were too many, too sharp, and the color of a freshly skinned deer. “Well, now, I’ve got just the thing. Come on up to the porch and we’ll talk. You can play guitar, right?”</p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block29"> </p>
	<p class="block28">Warren walked into the camp, Jeb’s guitar slung over his shoulder. The old monster told him it belonged to someone who tried to bring his wife back from the dead. It didn’t work out so well for him. ‘Course, it hadn’t looked like a guitar then. Things have a way of changing.</p>
	<p class="block29">Warren picked a slow dirge as he walked in. The outlaws rose up, reaching for their pistols and rifles. They froze as the mournful notes reached them, clutched at blinded eyes, at ears deaf to everything but the baleful song of Warren’s guitar. Seizures overtook them, and they collapsed, trembling on the ground. By the time Warren reached the chorus, they coughed black blood into the ground, their hands clawing at the dirt and rocks as pain ripped through their bodies. One bandit, bigger than the rest, managed to draw his pistol. He started to aim it at Warren, but instead placed it under his own chin before pulling the trigger.</p>
	<p class="block29">Rufus was there, in the middle of the camp, red tears streaming from his eyes. He clutched his stomach, coughing bits of himself up into the dust. “What are you? What devil from Hell?”</p>
	<p class="block29">Warren smiled, a sad, tired old thing. It had been a long time since such an expression graced his face. “Been a while, Mister Killane. Don’t reckon as you’d remember me.” Warren looked around, saw the rest of the gang was lying still and silent. “Well, looks like it’s down to you and me.” He set the guitar down.</p>
	<p class="block29">“What are you talking about?” Killane shouted, no longer able to hear his own words.</p>
	<p class="block29">Warren pulled a big hunting knife from his belt, and approached Killane. The outlaw tried to scramble away but only managed to sprawl onto his back. He fumbled for his gun, but his fingers were clumsy and unresponsive.</p>
	<p class="block29">“You killed my wife and my little girl. You burnt my home. You cut out my eye and joked while you did it. Well, I went and made myself a deal, and you’re seeing the results.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Deal? What deal?” Rufus screamed.</p>
	<p class="block29">Warren answered by cutting. Seemed old Jeb Johnson needed a new face.</p>
