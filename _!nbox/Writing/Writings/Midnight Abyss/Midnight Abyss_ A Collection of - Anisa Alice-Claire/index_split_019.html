	<p class="block24"> </p>
	<p class="block24"> </p>
	<p class="block28">THE TUNNEL NO longer held its shape. Fissures dug deep into the walls and large chunks of rock had broken free, littering the floor under Shira’s hands and knees. She shivered at the thought of the freezing that broke apart the rock. In the fissures, where ice crystals tended to form, powdery dust caked the surface.</p>
	<p class="block29">It’d been a while since Shira used a Dweller tunnel. Her father would beat her for lowering herself to Dweller standards, but it wasn’t likely he’d find out. He wouldn’t fit in the tunnel to find her. She barely fit herself, and she wasn’t fully-grown.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Ow!” Shira pulled her hand back and scowled at where the sharp edge cut into her palm. It didn’t draw blood though, so she placed her hand with more care and continued to crawl forward. Catching a wing, she stifled another cry. She backtracked enough to pull her feathers from the snag.</p>
	<p class="block29">When she reached the end of the tunnel, she stepped into the kitchens and straightened. Two sets of eyes watched her. One set was so old, wrinkles bordered his eyes and mouth and dark spots dotted his skin. The other was so young he shouldn’t be in the kitchens at all. He was too young for labor even by Flier standards.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Tunnels are worse than I remember,” she admitted as she dusted herself off.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Fliers don’t care, they don’t see it,” the old man said with a wry smile. Except for the lack of wings and his clear age, he could have been a Flier. Shira had never been able to figure why everyone assumed Fliers were better than Dwellers. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Think they would, it’s the foundation to the Eyrie.”</p>
	<p class="block29">The old man scoffed, but it turned into a cough that almost rocked him from his seat. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Mayel,” Shira sank to her knees beside his chair. She clasped his hand and felt the shaking he tried to conceal. “What’s wrong? Why’d you call for me?” Usually the old man came to her. This was the first time he’d ever asked her to visit him in the village. </p>
	<p class="block29">“I’m sick,” he tried to grin but failed. </p>
	<p class="block29">“He’s dying,” the little boy whispered with tears in his dark eyes.</p>
	<p class="block29">Shira’s heart clenched. She grasped at the first possible solution.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Maybe the Eyrie’s Elders would let you into the Birthing Chamber,” she suggested. The chamber was used for pregnancy, but she’d heard of people sleeping there to heal illnesses too. </p>
	<p class="block29">Mayel made a negative sound deep in his throat. He wiped his pale face with a cloth. </p>
	<p class="block29">“A Dweller so near the orbs? They’d kill me to prevent it.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Shira wanted to deny it but couldn’t.</p>
	<p class="block29">“I wouldn’t ask this, Shira, but the Dwellers need me.” Mayel’s breath came in shallow gasps. “Steal an orb for me. Steal the blue and white.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Shira stilled. Steal an orb?</p>
	<p class="block29">“I can’t,” she said, “it’ll burn out.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Again that painful, negative sound. “Some of your father’s teaching? An orb’s not so fragile as he says.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“What about the shield against the cold?” Shira cringed. It was a selfish question when the Eyrie had ten orbs and the Dwellers had none. The orbs’ power did not reach the base of the mountain where the Dwellers lived.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Have I ever lied to you?” Mayel asked.</p>
	<p class="block29">Shira shook her head. He’d always been honest, even when it was deeply painful.</p>
	<p class="block29">“One orb, Shira, is enough to shield the entire Eyrie. Only one.”</p>
	<p class="block29">She rested her forehead on their clasped hands and felt his trembling even as he tried to give her hand a squeeze in comfort. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Miro,” she said to the boy, “meet me in the statue hall at noon tomorrow. Now,” She grasped both sides of Mayel’s wrinkled face between her hands as she stood, “go home before the darkness turns to ice.” She kissed his forehead and stepped away. </p>
	<p class="block29">She watched Miro lead Mayel from the kitchens into the fast gathering night. They made it into a hut before the ice began to form. As full darkness fell, the outside of the hut turned shiny with ice. They’d cut it extremely close, and that, more than anything, told Shira how important Mayel’s request was.</p>
	<p class="block29">Shira spun and crawled back into the tunnel as the ice crept its way into the kitchen. She moved as fast as the tight space allowed but even still, the splintering of freezing rock and the frigid breath of fast freezing air nipped at her until she reached the shielded air of the Eyrie above.</p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block"> </p>
	<p class="block28">No Dweller could reach the orbs, and no Flier would touch them for fear of them burning out. This played well into Shira’s haphazard plan. They left the orbs unguarded except the brief moments, morning and night, when the Elders entered to maintain the shutters.</p>
	<p class="block29">When breakfast was called the next morning, Shira ate quickly and left, saying she needed more lessons on storm currents. However, when she exited the Great Hall, she turned left toward the Heaven’s Chamber, not right toward the classes. </p>
	<p class="block29">She’d never been in the Chamber before. Finding it empty, she ducked inside and gazed in wonder. </p>
	<p class="block29">Only Elders entered the Chamber to open the shutters at night. She’d always wondered why their faces glowed with soft light. Now she suspected she knew. The domed ceiling above held ten orbs swirling with color. They filled the room with warmth to the point that it felt like she walked through warm water instead of air. They bathed her skin in tingles. Shira’s eyes pricked with tears. </p>
	<p class="block29">When the shutters were open, the orbs’ light created a shield throughout the Eyrie’s walls against the cold. All her life, she’d felt their warmth at night but never before had she felt so enveloped.</p>
	<p class="block29">Shaking her head, Shira reminded herself why she was here. If she was found, she had no good reason to be in the Chamber. </p>
	<p class="block33">Mayel needs an orb.</p>
	<p class="block29">She spotted the blue and white one to her left. Spreading her wings, she flew through the thick air until she hovered before it where it rested in a shallow depression at the crown of the domed ceiling.</p>
	<p class="block29">Shira reached for the blue and white orb but pulled back. Was Mayel using her? <i class="calibre6">Yes. But he’s dying.</i> He’d never lied to her like her father. The more she learned about the orbs, the less she trusted what her father said. </p>
	<p class="block33">Just do it.</p>
	<p class="block29">She grasped the orb and pulled it free. It didn’t flare or sputter. While she sank to the ground, she held her breath. Then she checked the light of the orb in her hand against that of the ones on the ceiling. It burned just as brightly. </p>
	<p class="block33">Father lied.</p>
	<p class="block29">The knowledge tasted bitter on her tongue. She folded the orb into a scarf she’d brought. It didn’t conceal its light, but it was better than carrying the orb through the halls exposed. If she hurried, everyone would still be eating. </p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block28">Shira crouched in an unused hall of the Eyrie. She held her wings close to her shoulders while her back rested snug against an alcove where a statue used to stand. The crumbled remains of the statue littered the floor at Shira’s feet. It was one more sign of the deterioration of their world.</p>
	<p class="block29">Mayel loved to point out such spots. It was his way of showing Shira what the other Fliers refused to see. Even in her fifteen years, she’d seen the crumbling of stone and the ice crystals in the cracks expanding little by little every night. This statue was whole when she was a child. Her world was dying, and her father refused to believe it. </p>
	<p class="block29">Shira held her treasure close to her chest, afraid looking at it would decay it like everything else around her. However, she couldn’t resist peeking as the warmth of the orb soaked into her slender fingers. Holding her clasped hands out, she marveled at the glow. The orb’s light turned her skin red and she could almost make out her skeleton beneath. So much light. So much warmth.</p>
	<p class="block29">She cracked her thumbs apart to gaze at the orb as its glow touched her face. It fit easily in her hands and swirled blue and white, unconcerned that it’d been removed from its place in the Heaven’s Chamber.</p>
	<p class="block29">Her father said they couldn’t be moved, that the orb would burn out within seconds, leaving the world darker and colder. But she’d stolen it several hours ago. Checking, Shira confirmed it glowed just as powerfully now as when it hung against the ceiling. </p>
	<p class="block29">Mayel was right. The Eyrie was hoarding the orbs. </p>
	<p class="block29">Shira wiped moisture from her eyes with the backs of her hands. Mayel needed the warmth and light now. </p>
	<p class="block29">A scraping filled the hall. She held the orb close and folded her wings across her front like she was cold. The posture almost hid the glow. Almost.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Shira?”</p>
	<p class="block29">She relaxed. Miro turned the corner to her left. His dirty face held huge, nervous eyes. Being caught here, a ground Dweller in the Eyrie, would mean his death. His eyes calmed a little at the sight of her, but he still scanned the hall like something would pop out of the stone to eat him. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Hold out your hands,” Shira instructed. </p>
	<p class="block29">Miro cupped his hands as though he were begging and his mouth gaped when Shira retracted her wings. Beautiful light and warmth. Shira’s hands pulsed from holding it. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Hold it tight.” She transferred the orb to his small hands and closed his fingers around it with her own. </p>
	<p class="block29">“This’ll help,” she promised. </p>
	<p class="block29">Miro swallowed. “Thank you.” </p>
	<p class="block29">He darted away. The scraping filled the hall, and then Shira was alone. She held her hands close while they were still warm. Mayel would get better. He had to.</p>
	<p class="block29">Pushing to a standing position, Shira stepped out of the alcove and stretched her limbs. Her wings touched the ceiling. That’s why the hall was unused; most adult Fliers couldn’t walk it comfortably. Shira didn’t know how or why, but her people had grown in stature and now the older parts of the Eyrie were not made to contain them. </p>
	<p class="block29">But they were lovely for a young girl yet to grow wings. That’s how she’d met Mayel. She’d been exploring and found him scavenging supplies. Instead of screaming about the ground Dweller, she’d stepped forward to touch his dirty, wrinkled face. </p>
	<p class="block29">Shira sniffed. She scrubbed her face with her hands and rubbed her eyes before stepping out into the games arena. As she walked into the open and dove from the walkway to join the other Fliers in a game of ball, she plastered a smile on her lips.</p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block28">The loss of the orb was discovered that evening when the Elders entered the Heaven’s Chamber to open the shutters. </p>
	<p class="block29">Shira ducked into her room before the general panic swept her up in its wake. Cries of shock echoed beyond her door. Would nine orbs be enough to keep the Eyrie warm? What if more were stolen? Who would do such a thing? </p>
	<p class="block29">Shira tucked her wings close and gazed out her window. Touching the windowsill, she checked her fingers. They came away clean. This close to the core of the Eyrie no signs of the cold touched the stone yet. It would though. Even with ten orbs it would eventually seep in because the base of the Eyrie was cracking. It would spread. </p>
	<p class="block29">Down below, at the roots of the mountain, small dots shifted about. Ground Dwellers. All of whom survived without the light and warmth of the orbs. It could be done. </p>
	<p class="block29">Although, with the world decaying, the ground Dwellers were dying. They dug deep underground to escape the cold. It helped for a while but the cold was spreading, and they couldn’t dig fast enough to escape it. </p>
	<p class="block29">Shira was still staring at the moving dots when the door opened behind her. She didn’t turn to see who entered. Only one person would come in without knocking. </p>
	<p class="block29">“I think a ground Dweller stole the orb,” her father announced without a greeting.</p>
	<p class="block29">Shira snorted. “How? By growing wings?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“It’s—“ he cut short. “You’re right. It’s unlikely. I just can’t believe a Flier would do this.” He threw down his coat and joined her at the window.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Since it’s been moved, it burned out, right?” Shira asked, clutching her hands together to hide their shaking.</p>
	<p class="block29">A grunt was the response. Shira glanced at him from beneath her lashes, taking in the soft glow of his skin that all Elders had. Shirkan Golden-Feather cut a stern figure, and his face was bitter at the moment.</p>
	<p class="block29">He lied on purpose. She hadn’t been sure, but his response said a lot without words. It also showed he didn’t know who actually stole the orb. </p>
	<p class="block29">“I must go calm the others.” He spun away, collected his jacket and left, the door thudding closed behind him.</p>
	<p class="block29">Shira’s stomach clenched. Even if she’d been curled in the corner sobbing, he would have acted the same. He stopped by only because it appeared right. </p>
	<p class="block29">Returning to her window observations, Shira stepped up onto the ledge and jumped. Her wings spread and caught the updraft from the mountain. She drifted for a time high above and then dropped lower until she could make out actual features of the ground Dwellers. </p>
	<p class="block29">There was a stark difference between them and the Fliers. A frailty to their limbs, hollow cheeks and sunken eyes. Not a one stood taller than Shira’s shoulder. A few cast her dark looks, but none openly defied her. How could her father think a ground Dweller stole the orb? Few of them had the strength to climb into the Eyrie, much less somehow get to the ceiling of the Heaven’s Chamber.</p>
	<p class="block29">Shira winged higher and spotted several Fliers take off above. She coasted to the Eyrie wall to land on a balcony.</p>
	<p class="block29">The Fliers headed into the village below. By the time they landed, most of the Dwellers were out of sight. Although they wouldn’t openly defy the Fliers, they would hide from them. It was one advantage to their diminutive stature. The Dwellers didn’t just live on the ground, they worked in it, digging deep tunnels no Flier could fit in. </p>
	<p class="block29">Leaning on the balcony railing, Shira covered her mouth before she openly chuckled. The Fliers moved door to door. They’d disappeared inside only to come out empty handed. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Something amusing?”</p>
	<p class="block29">Shira started. Spinning, she saw Elder Lalinna hobbling toward her. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Forgive me, Elder,” Shira bowed with her wings spread over her head in shame. “I didn’t think when I landed. I didn’t realize this was your balcony.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Lalinna waved off her concern. She came to lean against the railing beside Shira and watched the happenings below. </p>
	<p class="block29">“They are a bit amusing, aren’t they?” Lalinna asked. </p>
	<p class="block29">“I just don’t see the point,” Shira admitted. “We can’t chase them below ground, and, even if they did take the orb, it’d be burned out by now.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Shira watched the Elder’s face as she said the last part. Lalinna started out nodding but then she stilled. Her eyes, sharp even in old age, narrowed. She focused on the ground below, on the village and the futile efforts of the two Fliers, but her fingers tapped the balcony railing, and her lips pinched in. </p>
	<p class="block29">“I would’ve thought your father more forthcoming with you,” she said.</p>
	<p class="block29">Shira’s heart beat hard against her ribs. None of the other Elders ever spoke openly with her. Perhaps because Lalinna rarely left her rooms now, she craved conversation. Even the glow in her skin was softened and dulled by time. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Forthcoming?” she asked. Only through great care did she keep from clasping the Elder’s hands in interest. Even still, her fingers twitched. </p>
	<p class="block29">Lalinna noted the movement, but what she thought of it Shira couldn’t tell. </p>
	<p class="block29">“We Elders are a cautious group. Too cautious perhaps. Because of who you are, I’ll tell you this, young Shira, the orbs were not ours to begin with. They were not originally in the Heaven’s Chamber.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Shira’s mouth went dry. “We moved them here? They didn’t burn out? Where did they sit originally?” She cut off as the old Flier turned calculating eyes on her. Those dark eyes didn’t miss much.</p>
	<p class="block29">“It’s called the Hunt.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Shira gasped.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Yes,” Lalinna continued, “history class teaches it was about food and, on some level, it was. Food grows better near an orb, but at its core, the Hunt was a race to claim the orbs. Flight was an advantage but,” the old Flier stooped and picked up a large pot full of dirt, “we didn’t understand the orbs like the Dwellers. I fear we still don’t.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Hefting the pot, the Elder pitched it at the doorway. Shards crashed to the floor along with dirt. Part of the trim on the door crumbled and beneath the missing chunk ran spidery fissures.</p>
	<p class="block29">Shira couldn’t resist. She stepped over to run her fingers along the cracks. She’d seen them in the outlying tunnels but not so close to the core of the Eyrie. </p>
	<p class="block29">“We can’t see it yet, but our home’s dying.”</p>
	<p class="block29">The words sounded so much like Mayel. Shira glanced at Lalinna to make sure she hadn’t changed into the aged Dweller.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Why?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“We meddled with things we didn’t understand.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Can we fix it?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Perhaps. Although, pride is very bitter to swallow.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Shira returned to her spot at the railing. She never would’ve hoped an Elder would speak of this, much less admit they’d lied about the orbs.</p>
	<p class="block29">“What would we have to do to fix things?”</p>
	<p class="block29">Lalinna didn’t answer. She turned to lean her back against the railing. Those dark eyes watched Shira with an unwavering gaze. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Too quick, girl,” she shook her head. “I tested you and you failed.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“I’m sorry?” Shira shrank from the look on the Elder’s face. Any kindness Shira had seen in those old eyes was now gone.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Indoctrinated all your life to our given right to the orbs, our superiority over other races, and a single example of wrong,” she waved a skeletal hand at the doorway, “convinces you we’re ruining the world?” Lalinna snorted. “No. You’ve heard this before but not from your father. You sympathize with the Dwellers!”</p>
	<p class="block29">Shira’s heart beat so hard it might have wings of its own. Her stomach rolled. </p>
	<p class="block29">Lalinna’s lips twitched. “One side effect to handling orbs all my life,” she said, “I can see their trails. What they’ve touched. Besides, a Dweller can’t get to the ceiling of the Heaven’s Chamber.”</p>
	<p class="block29">The Elder grasped Shira’s hands in a grip that turned her fingertips white. She flipped Shira’s hands palms up.</p>
	<p class="block29">“They’re glazed with light,” she said, flinging Shira’s hand away from her like they dirtied her just by touching them.</p>
	<p class="block29">Shira hugged her middle. She couldn’t deny something the Elder could see with her own eyes. </p>
	<p class="block29">“You don’t still have the orb,” Lalinna said. “I see the trail down there. It ends in the village and just disappears.” The Elder eyed her, waiting for a response.</p>
	<p class="block29">Shira backed a step. Did her father know of Lalinna’s sight? Would he believe her over the Elder? No. Resoundingly no. He favored her not at all. </p>
	<p class="block29">“What are you going to do?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“For your father’s sake, I’ll give you this one chance. Go. You threw your fate in with the Dwellers when you stole the orb. Now hope they will accept you. If I see you again in the Eyrie, I’ll have them clip your wings.” She pointed toward the door. </p>
	<p class="block29">Shira glanced at it. If Lalinna could see the light on her hands, some of the others might too, and there were a lot of people in the hall right now. Instead of heading for the door, she planted a foot on the railing and shoved off into the air. She glanced back to see Lalinna’s expression, but the Elder was no longer at the railing. Instead, she was inside her rooms, dressing in her official robes. A messenger boy stood beside her. </p>
	<p class="block29">As Shira dove toward the village, she shivered at the change in temperature. As one flew higher, the colder it became. But not here. Here the Eyrie was always noticeably warmer than the village below. </p>
	<p class="block29">She knew now the difference wasn’t natural. It was upsetting the world. But maybe she could set part of it right. Banking to the side, Shira caught the up draft of the mountain instead of landing like she’d intended.</p>
	<p class="block29">Reaching her balcony, she closed her wings and landed, hitting the ground running. </p>
	<p class="block29">She threw together a bag of clothing and the few treasured items she couldn’t leave behind. A brush that was her mother’s, a necklace her grandfather passed on when he died, and a book of poems her father gave her on her tenth birthday. </p>
	<p class="block29">It was the only thing he’d ever given her.</p>
	<p class="block29">Shira shrugged the pack over her shoulder before peeking into the hall. </p>
	<p class="block29">Lalinna was preparing for council. That meant everyone had been called to the Great Hall. </p>
	<p class="block29">As she’d hoped, the hallway was empty. Making her way toward the Heaven’s Chamber, she stopped just before the last turn before the doors. To the right of the doors was a set of spiral stairs. At this point, the area would be guarded. </p>
	<p class="block29">The air around her was warm, almost like a soft blanket sliding over her skin. Even outside the Chamber, the orbs’ warmth affected the air. Shira regretted she wouldn’t get to feel their full power again. She wasn’t headed for the Chamber this time.</p>
	<p class="block29">This time she aimed to take the spiral stairs to the room above it. As she’d pulled the orb free that morning, she found a small door behind the glowing ball large enough for an orb to pass through. She thought she knew where that door led. Women in the last term of pregnancy slept above the orbs in the Birthing Chamber. The Elders said it was for a blessing on the child from the heavens. </p>
	<p class="block29">Shira visited her mother there when she was pregnant with a new child. It hadn’t bestowed a blessing. Birth killed both child and mother. </p>
	<p class="block29">Shira had stared at the floor during the birthing just outside the alcove her mother screamed in. She’d been afraid to look, to see her mother bleeding. The round stones of the floor still came into her dreams. Silvery stones, warm on the feet and smooth from many soles. Each alcove had an entry stone at the center of the entrance in the floor that glowed slightly around the edges. A single, perfectly round, glowing stone. </p>
	<p class="block29">Why she hadn’t questioned it sooner, she wasn’t sure. Perhaps because she hated the memory. </p>
	<p class="block29">Shira looked around the corner and spotted two Elders with their glowing faces. They fidgeted from one foot to another. </p>
	<p class="block29">Cupping her hands around her mouth, Shira whispered, “Mallor, Acosta. Come look.”</p>
	<p class="block29">The whisper bounced, as she’d hoped, against the high, angled ceiling of the hall. The Elders looked at each other. </p>
	<p class="block29">“No one’s in there,” Mallor insisted.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Someone’s in there,” Acosta said. </p>
	<p class="block29">They opened the Chamber doors and looked inside. Not seeing anyone, they both stepped into the room for a closer look. </p>
	<p class="block29">Shira darted to the stairs. She took them two at a time, using her wings for balance until she reached the small door at the top. She had it closed behind her before the Elders emerged below. Pulling her hand from the handle, she clasped her fingers into a fist. <i class="calibre6">Stop shaking. </i>Throwing her voice wouldn’t work on the way out. She’d have to make a run for it. </p>
	<p class="block29">She mentally shoved the thought aside as she stepped away from the door and walked the hallway up to the Birthing Chamber. It curved around the outside wall and, now that she’d put it together, Shira knew this hallway spiraled around the top of the Heaven’s Chamber. Reaching the top, she glanced around the birthing alcoves. No one was present. They hadn’t had a pregnancy in years. </p>
	<p class="block29">Picking an entry stone at random, Shira knelt to touch the silvery surface. It was almost too warm for comfort. She rummaged in her pack for her mother’s brush. When she found it, she inserted the handle next to the stone’s edge and lifted it from the floor. </p>
	<p class="block29">It came free without a sound and there, nestled against the ceiling below, sat an orb. Its light was soft. Shira’s eyes pricked like they had before when so close to an orb. It was like it was aware and sad. </p>
	<p class="block29">Shira extracted the orb and carefully tucked it amongst her clothing in her pack. It wouldn’t hide the glow but it wasn’t like she was going to get out unnoticed anyway. </p>
	<p class="block29">She considered taking more, and then decided against it. she wasn’t sure how the Dwellers hid the first one. If they couldn’t hide this second one, they’d be in serious trouble from the Fliers. </p>
	<p class="block29">Slinging her pack back over her shoulder, Shira stood. The Birthing Chamber smelled of blood and birthing fluids. They tried to clean the place but the smells lingered in a musty sort of way like they were soaked into the stones and part of the alcoves now.</p>
	<p class="block29">She shuddered as she headed for the door, but the handle turned in her hand. Backing away, the door swung open. </p>
	<p class="block29">Acosta gapped at her. </p>
	<p class="block29">Shira dropped her wings loosely over her shoulders and pack and grinned at the Elder. He was younger than the others. Perhaps he wouldn’t see. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Strange times,” she shrugged. “Father asked me to check if anyone was in the Birthing Chamber when the council was called.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“But how—“</p>
	<p class="block29">“I need to go join him now,” she cut over him, “so if you’ll excuse me.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Instinctively, he held the door and made space for her to pass on the stairs. She smiled at him and took her time descending. She almost made the corner before Mallor called from the Heaven’s Chamber. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Miss Shira? You’re glo—“</p>
	<p class="block29">She took off running. The hall followed the outside of the Eyrie until it passed the Great Hall. The noise coming from it was enough to drown out Mallor’s voice. Everyone was chattering. Something must have unsettled them, for usually only the Elders spoke. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Enough!” It was her father’s voice. “We’ve brought before you conclusive evidence this Dweller was a part of the scheme.”</p>
	<p class="block29">She’d been headed for the nearest open balcony, which sat at the other end of the narrow hall past the Great Hall but she stopped short as she caught a glimpse of a Dweller through the press of people. </p>
	<p class="block29">Dark head, narrow shoulders, dirty little face. He could have been any Dweller but he wasn’t. He was Mayel’s boy, Miro. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Hang him,” someone spoke up. </p>
	<p class="block29">Agreement sounded from around the Hall, reinforced by everyone’s fears.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Interrogate him first,” shouted a voice over the general clamor. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Hang him upside down from the balcony,” another chimed in.</p>
	<p class="block29">Shira felt sick. Her ears rang with the angry voices like a bell in her skull. Miro was just a boy.</p>
	<p class="block29">Those dark brown eyes were huge as the Eyrie debated his fate. Shira didn’t have a clue what evidence her father produced but the boy’s guilt was a foregone conclusion. </p>
	<p class="block29"><span class="calibre3">“I warned you, girl.” Lalinna grasped her arm in a bony grip and shoved her toward the Hall.  “It’s time to clip your wings.” </span></p>
	<p class="block29">Shira draped her wings close. Somehow the Elder hadn’t seen the orb’s glow in her pack yet. She stumbled through the crowd and lost sight of Miro until the Elder shoved her into the open center of the Hall. Then she spotted him being held on the balcony by her father while another Elder fitted a noose over his dark head. </p>
	<p class="block29">“You monsters!” she pushed back against Lalinna’s grip and the old woman flared her wings to keep from falling over.</p>
	<p class="block29">Yanking her arm free, Shira bared her teeth at the Elder and spun away before Lalinna grabbed for her again. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Let him go. He’s only a boy. Let him go!”</p>
	<p class="block29">“She’s glowing, stop her!” Lalinna’s shout mingled with her own, making them both unintelligible.</p>
	<p class="block29">People backed away as Shira raced toward the balcony. Her father turned, the look on his face shifting from surprise to shock and then to the angry scowl she knew so well. </p>
	<p class="block29">Her father handed Miro over to the other Elder and caught Shira before she could reach the boy. She struggled but couldn’t stop them from cinching the noose tight against his throat. Then they started tying the other end to the railing.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Let the Dwellers see his punishment,” someone said. </p>
	<p class="block29">“She’s got an orb!” Lalinna again.</p>
	<p class="block29">“No!” With a sudden twist, Shira broke loose. She stepped, reached for Miro, and was shoved from behind, perhaps by an over zealous person trying to catch her. She couldn’t stall her forward momentum. Slamming into the boy, they tumbled over the railing. </p>
	<p class="block29">Miro screamed and screamed. They hadn’t finished tying the rope off. His weight tore it loose, and it flapped behind him like some mindless tail. Snatching at Miro’s feet, Shira pulled him against her chest and gave her wings a flap. It slowed their fall but the combined weight ripped tendons. Shira sobbed as she attempted another flap. Something snapped in her back and fierce pain lanced into her spine.</p>
	<p class="block29">The ground was coming up too fast. Dozens of faces looked up at them with horror. </p>
	<p class="block29">Shira tried to spread her wings, to stall their momentum. Only the left wing responded. It sent them into a crazy spin as the ground and faces grew larger. </p>
	<p class="block29">With one last effort, she flared her wing, spun around and slammed, back first, onto the ground with a crunch of bone. At first there was nothing except white pain. Then there were dozens of Fliers in the sky above and shouts nearby. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Get below. They’re coming. Get—“<span class="tab">      </span></p>
	<p class="block29">“Mi—Miro?” Shira asked. </p>
	<p class="block29">No one answered. Miro’s weight was removed from her and someone grasped her as though to pick her up. </p>
	<p class="block29">She screamed.</p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block28">Someone kept asking for Miro. Over and over and over. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Shh, he’s fine.” The voice wasn’t familiar. </p>
	<p class="block29">Shira tried to look around, but everything was blurred like she was still spinning in flight. She asked for Miro again. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Shhh. He’s alive. And in a bit better shape than you. Hold this.”</p>
	<p class="block29">An object was set on her stomach. Instinctively, she moved her hands to hold it. The motion felt stiff and restricted as her hands folded around the object, she sighed. Warmth and light. Her body relaxed and she gave up trying to see as she held the orb tight.</p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block8"><span class="text">* </span><span class="text1">*</span><span class="text"> *</span></p>
	<p class="block30"> </p>
	<p class="block28">Shira frowned as she opened her eyes. The walls were close and rough with a shiny texture. She shook her head and blinked. </p>
	<p class="block29">“Not what you’re used to but it grows on you after a time.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Shira gasped. “Mayel?”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Yours truly,” he swept a low bow.</p>
	<p class="block29">“You’re better.” It was an understatement. The shaking of his hands, the frailty to his movements, the pale, sweaty skin were all gone and so were his wrinkles and liver spots. Everything that marked him as old.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Much better,” he agreed as he came to sit beside her bed.</p>
	<p class="block29">“You’re not Mayel’s son or something?” Shira reached a hand out to touch his cheek.</p>
	<p class="block29">He grinned. “No.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“Then what?” she waved her hand at him.</p>
	<p class="block29">“Now you see one close held secret of the orbs. You did well in stealing a second one. It saved your life.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“I don’t understand.”</p>
	<p class="block29">“The orbs are shields, as you’ve been taught, but each one holds a secondary use. The first one you stole, the blue and white, heals diseases. The second one, the green and blue, mends and grows bones.” Mayel stood and reached to help Shira sit up. “May I?”</p>
	<p class="block29">She nodded, and he gently lifted her shoulders until she was sitting. He leaned her forward to lift her wing away from her back. </p>
	<p class="block29">Shira expected pain but she could only stare as he flared the feathers to their full length.</p>
	<p class="block29">“It’ll be awhile before they’re strong enough to fly but the bones are whole.” He folded the wing back against her shoulder. “I’m sure your father’s beyond angry.”</p>
	<p class="block29">She remembered the fall and swallowed back tears. “He pushed us.”</p>
	<p class="block29">Mayel grasped her hand.</p>
	<p class="block29">“He and others have been out looking for us,” he said. </p>
	<p class="block29">“How have you kept the orbs? Lalinna can see them.”</p>
	<p class="block29">A wry grin pulled at his lips. “I know. But she can’t see them through quartz.” He pointed at the ceiling, “and the Fliers are afraid to come too far below. We are shielded now.”</p>
	<p class="block29">They fell silent and listened to the cracking of the earth above as night fell and ice froze it solid. The orbs protected their small area but did nothing for the surface of the earth.</p>
	<p class="block29">“We can defend ourselves now,” Mayel said. </p>
	<p class="block37">Shira squeezed his hand, but she couldn’t help wondering what she’d started.</p>
