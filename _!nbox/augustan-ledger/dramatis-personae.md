# DRAMATIS PERSONAE: THE AUGUSTAN AGE (JAN 2026)

## THE IMPERIAL CENTER (ROME)

* **AUGUSTUS (Donald J. Trump):** The First Citizen. Operating beyond the "Senate" (UN/Congress) to manage the Empire through direct decree and surgical force. Motto: "Management, not Partnership."
* **MARK ANTONY (Marco Rubio):** Secretary of State. The diplomat-legionary tasked with bringing the Western Hemisphere (The Provinces) into alignment. Currently managing the "Submission" of Venezuela.
* **THE PRETORIAN PREFECT (Pete Hegseth):** Secretary of Defense. Commander of the elite forces that captured Vercingetorix. He ensures the "Legions" are loyal to the Throne, not the old Republic.
* **THE IMPERIAL ARCHITECT (Stephen Miller):** Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy. The ideological enforcer and author of the "Don-roe Doctrine." He maps the next frontiers (Greenland/Mexico).
* **MARCUS CRASSUS (Elon Musk):** Lead of DOGE / Private Contractor. The financier-technologist whose private infrastructure (Starlink/SpaceX) provides the nervous system for Imperial logistics.
* **THE PUBLICAN (Robert Lighthizer / Jamieson Greer):** Trade Representatives. The "Tax Farmers" who extract tribute from the provinces (Canada/Mexico) via 25%+ tariffs.

## THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNORS & CAPTIVES

* **VERCINGETORIX (Nicolás Maduro):** The Captured Chieftain. Formerly King of the Orinoco (Venezuela), now chained in the Tullianum (MDC Brooklyn). Status: Remanded until March 17.
* **CLEOPATRA (Delcy Rodríguez):** The Caretaker Queen. Managing the ruins of Venezuela. She has offered "Total Collaboration" to Rome to avoid her brother's cage.
* **THE GALLIC TRIBUNES (Canada / Calgary):** Legacy resource providers rendered redundant by the capture of Egypt (Venezuela). They are currently watching their currency (Loonie) and grain (Oil) lose 5% of their value in a morning.
* **HEROD (Benjamin Netanyahu):** The Client King of Judea. Given the Roman Peace to manage his borders, provided he doesn't disrupt the Emperor's "Board of Trade" in the Levant.

## THE MIDDLE EASTERN CLIENT KINGS

* **THE BYZANTINE (Erdoğan / Turkey):** The "Guarantor of Gaza." Augustus has tapped him to be the primary "enforcer" of the Levant peace. He is the bridge between Rome and the East—useful, but Rome keeps a hand on the sword because of his ties to the "Persian" sphere.
* **THE NABATAEAN (Mohammed bin Salman / Saudi Arabia):** The Master of Logistics. He is the financier of the "New Gaza" and the hub for the Empire's AI and tech future. He pays tribute in capital and "Oil Stability" to keep the Roman legions out of his sands.
* **THE PHARAOH (Al-Sisi / Egypt):** The southern gatekeeper. Tasked with holding the line at the Sinai and managing the "bread" (grain/aid) flow to the Levant.

---

## THE SOUTHERN PROVINCES & FRONTIER KINGS

* **THE NEW AZTEC QUEEN (Claudia Sheinbaum / Mexico):** The Besieged Neighbor. Currently under "Aerial Surveillance" (The P-8 Poseidon). She is being told to crush the Cartels (The Rebels) or Rome will do it for her. Her sovereignty is currently "Provisional."
* **THE ANDEAN REBEL (Gustavo Petro / Colombia):** The Next Target. Augustus has openly called him "sick" and hinted at a "surgical strike." He is the outlier who refuses to kneel, putting his kingdom in the crosshairs of the next Legionary movement.
* **THE MERCHANT OF THE INDUS (Narendra Modi / India):** The "Transaction King." He avoids Roman politics to focus on Roman trade. He is the one Rome calls when it needs to "burden-share" in the Indo-Pacific, provided the price is right.
* **THE ZULU TRIBUNE (South Africa):** The Moral Dissident. The loudest voice in the "Senate" (UN) calling Rome a "Criminal Empire." He is leading the "BRICS Bloc" to build a wall of paper treaties against Roman steel.

---

## THE EXTERNAL EMPIRES (THE PARTHIANS & THE BEAR)

* **THE PARTHIAN KING (Xi Jinping):** The Eastern Rival. Silent but lethal. He is using "Silk Road" economic sabotage and rare earth squeezes to counter the Roman expansion.
* **THE RUSSIAN BEAR (Vladimir Putin):** The Northern Menace. Moving his "Iron Fish" (Submarines) into the GIUK Gap to challenge Rome's claim to the Alps (Greenland).

---

## THE EUROPEAN VASSALS (GAUL & GERMANIA)

* **THE BORDER WARDEN (Donald Tusk / Poland):** The "Wall-Builder." He is the one trying to convince the rest of Europe that "Unity or Death" is the only choice as Rome eyes the Alps (Greenland).
* **THE REBELLIOUS CLIENT (Viktor Orbán / Hungary):** The "Palace Informant." He is Rome's man inside the EU, using his veto to silence the "finger-wagging" of the Gallic and Germanic kings.
* **THE NORTHERN CHIEFTAINS (Denmark / Greenland):** The "Gatekeepers of the Ice." Currently holding the 20-day "Annexation Clock." They are desperate to prove they can "hold the wall" so Rome doesn't have to take it.

---

## THE FRONTIER AGITATORS

* **THE NORTHERN NOMAD (Kim Jong Un):** The unpredictable chieftain. Using "Fire-Arrows" (Missiles) to demand attention while Augustus looks at the Orinoco.
* **THE PERSIAN SHAH (Khamenei/Raisi):** A fading power facing a "Slave Revolt" (Protests) at home. He is selling his smithing (Weapons) for digital gold (Crypto) to survive.

---

## THE GUILD OF ALCHEMISTS (TECH)

* **THE AGENTS (AI):** The new digital labor class. 2026 is the year they must prove they can "Generate Tribute" (ROI) or face the scrap heap.
* **THE SPECTACLES (CES 2026):** The Imperial Fair in Las Vegas where the latest "Chariots" (Self-driving cars) and "Oracles" (Smart Glasses) are paraded.
