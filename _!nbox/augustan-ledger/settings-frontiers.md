# THE IMPERIAL SETTINGS & FRONTIERS

## THE IMPERIAL SETTINGS

* **THE TULLIANUM (Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn):** The damp, dark cell where Vercingetorix awaits the Roman "Justice" system.
* **EGYPT (Venezuela / The Orinoco):** The captured resource treasury. The world's largest oil tap, now under "Imperial Management" to fund the Roman Center.
* **THE ALPS (Greenland):** The high ground. A 20-day "Annexation Clock" has been set to secure the minerals and the Northern Wall against the Bear.
* **TRANSALPINE GAUL (Canada):** A loyal but expensive province currently being "disintermediated" and ignored as its strategic value is transferred to the South.
* **THE FORUM (The UN Security Council):** A theater for speeches where the "Senate" wags its finger while the Legions move the borders.

## THE STRATEGIC SETTINGS (THE FRONTIER)

* **THE LEVANT (Gaza/Israel):** No longer a war zone, but a "Special Economic Zone." A Roman-managed construction site designed to be the "Hub of the East."
* **THE GIUK GAP:** The maritime "Alps." The cold water where the Russian Bear's "Iron Fish" (Submarines) are currently playing a game of chicken with Roman destroyers.
* **THE ORINOCO BASIN:** The "New Egypt." The resource-rich valley that Rome now manages to ensure the grain (oil) never stops flowing and the price never rises.

## THE TREASURY

* **THE EXEMPTION:** Rome has officially told the world that Imperial Merchants do not pay taxes to foreign kings. The "Global Tax" is dead.
