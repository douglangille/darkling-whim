# THE AUGUSTAN LEDGER

**Operational Reality:** Tracking current events through the lens of Augustus-era Rome.

## Purpose

This is a darkly playful coping mechanism for understanding the world stage without being consumed by emotion. By translating contemporary geopolitics into Roman Empire frameworks, we strip away diplomatic language to expose the raw mechanics: resource extraction, jurisdictional assertion, client state management.

The "Don-roe Doctrine" (Universal U.S. Jurisdictional Reach) - a play on the Monroe Doctrine that captures the contemporary assertion of global reach.

## Tone & Style

Cinematic prose in the vein of Tarantino meets political analysis - scene-based narrative with sharp sensory details, punchy dialogue, and brutal clarity about power dynamics. No sentimentality. Every detail does work.

We're not endorsing or celebrating - we're calling things what they are. Maduro isn't a "detained foreign national," he's Vercingetorix in chains. The MDC Brooklyn really is a modern Tullianum.

**See [CUSTOM-INSTRUCTIONS.md](CUSTOM-INSTRUCTIONS.md) for the complete writing guide used in Perplexity Spaces.**

## Structure

- `entries/` - Chronological ledger entries written as scene-based narratives with title cards for transitions
- `dramatis-personae.md` - Character mapping (current leaders → Roman archetypes)
- `settings-frontiers.md` - Geographic and strategic locations
- `writing-sample.md` - Reference tone/style example
- `CUSTOM-INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Perplexity Space configuration for consistent voice

## Entry Format

Each entry reads like a chapter from a Tarantino political thriller:
- Title cards (## headings) for scene transitions (e.g., "THE TULLIANUM," "THE ALPS," "MAR-A-LAGO")
- Close third-person POV in the primary newsmaker's head
- Mandatory dialogue in every scene showing power dynamics
- Sensory grounding (temperature, objects, positioning)
- Sharp ending beats that land the truth
- Strategic ledger at the bottom with hard facts/dates/sources

## Workflow

### For New Chat Sessions (Rehydration)

1. **Read the character guide:** Start with `dramatis-personae.md` to understand who's who
2. **Check the custom instructions:** Review `CUSTOM-INSTRUCTIONS.md` for voice and format requirements
3. **Scan recent entries:** Look at the latest files in `entries/` to catch up on the board state
4. **Search for updates:** When adding new entries, always search current events first
5. **Write in voice:** Use the Tarantino cinematic prose style with mandatory dialogue
6. **Push to repo:** All new entries get timestamped filenames (YYYY-MM-DD format)

### When Tracking Developments

- Search for updates on key players (Augustus, Vercingetorix, the Alps, etc.)
- Translate events into Roman framework (no diplomatic language)
- Write scenes with dialogue, sensory details, and clear location markers
- End each scene with a sharp beat (decision, observation, punchline)
- Close with Strategic Ledger section containing hard facts
- Maintain cold-eyed clarity - no emotion, all mechanics

### Voice Requirements

**Cinematic. Cold-eyed. Sensory-grounded. No emotion, all clarity.**

- Scene cuts between power centers (## headers with location/time)
- Object work (coffee, tablets, ties, briefing folders)
- Secondary characters reacting (staffers texting, advisors in backgrounds)
- Dialogue reveals power through rhythm, interruption, questions as weapons
- The punchline always lands at the end
- Zero sentimentality

## Philosophy

"The Republic is a ghost story. We are in the Management business now."

This analytical distance lets us engage with what's actually happening without being swept up in the performance. It's watching a play you're taking notes on, not drowning in the news cycle.

## Imperial Motto

"Vassalage for Peace. Resources for Protection. The Map is what We say it is."

## Current Board State (As of Jan 6, 2026)

- **VERCINGETORIX (Maduro):** In the Tullianum (MDC Brooklyn). Pleaded not guilty. Next hearing: March 17, 2026.
- **THE ALPS (Greenland):** Hot frontier under 20-day annexation pressure. Denmark's PM warns US attack would "end NATO." Augustus mocking their "one more dog sled" defense. Jeff Landry appointed Special Envoy.
- **THE ANDEAN REBEL (Petro/Colombia):** On Augustus's target list. Deployed 30,000 troops to Venezuelan border. Refusing vassalage.
- **THE GALLIC TRIBUNES (Canada):** Being economically crushed by 25% tariffs. Currency sliding. Strategic value evaporating as Egypt (Venezuela) replaces their resource position.
- **CLEOPATRA (Delcy Rodríguez):** Managing Venezuela's ruins. Offering total collaboration to avoid her predecessor's cage.

*Note: This is a creative analytical framework, not a political endorsement. The Roman lens is chosen for its parallels in resource management, jurisdictional expansion, and the performance of power.*
