# THE AUGUSTAN LEDGER

**Operational Reality:** Tracking current events through the lens of Augustus-era Rome.

## Purpose

This is a darkly playful coping mechanism for understanding the world stage without being consumed by emotion. By translating contemporary geopolitics into Roman Empire frameworks, we strip away diplomatic language to expose the raw mechanics: resource extraction, jurisdictional assertion, client state management.

The "Don-roe Doctrine" (Universal U.S. Jurisdictional Reach) - a play on the Monroe Doctrine that captures the contemporary assertion of global reach.

## Tone & Style

Cinematic prose in the vein of Tarantino meets political analysis - scene-based narrative with sharp sensory details, punchy dialogue, and brutal clarity about power dynamics. No sentimentality. Every detail does work.

We're not endorsing or celebrating - we're calling things what they are. Maduro isn't a "detained foreign national," he's Vercingetorix in chains. The MDC Brooklyn really is a modern Tullianum.

## Structure

- `entries/` - Chronological ledger entries written as scene-based narratives with title cards for transitions
- `dramatis-personae.md` - Character mapping (current leaders → Roman archetypes)
- `settings-frontiers.md` - Geographic and strategic locations
- `writing-sample.md` - Reference tone/style example

## Entry Format

Each entry reads like a novel chapter with:
- Title cards (## headings) for scene transitions (e.g., "THE TULLIANUM," "THE ALPS," "THE ANDEAN TARGET")
- Cinematic prose with dialogue and sensory grounding
- Strategic ledger at the bottom with hard facts/dates for reference

## Workflow

### For New Chat Sessions (Rehydration)

1. **Read the character guide:** Start with `dramatis-personae.md` to understand who's who
2. **Check the tone:** Review `writing-sample.md` for voice and style
3. **Scan recent entries:** Look at the latest files in `entries/` to catch up on the board state
4. **Search for updates:** When adding new entries, always search current events first
5. **Write in voice:** Use the cinematic, scene-based prose style consistently
6. **Push to repo:** All new entries get timestamped filenames (YYYY-MM-DD format)

### When Tracking Developments

- Search for updates on key players (Augustus, Vercingetorix, the Alps, etc.)
- Translate events into Roman framework (no diplomatic language)
- Write scenes with sensory details, dialogue, and clear location markers
- End with Strategic Ledger section containing hard facts
- Maintain cold-eyed clarity - no emotion, all mechanics

### Voice Requirements

**Cinematic. Cold-eyed. Sensory-grounded. No emotion, all clarity.**

- Scene cuts between power centers
- Object work (coins, maps, tactical vests)
- Smell/taste/texture grounding
- Dialogue reveals character through rhythm
- The punchline always lands at the end
- Zero sentimentality

## Philosophy

"The Republic is a ghost story. We are in the Management business now."

This analytical distance lets us engage with what's actually happening without being swept up in the performance. It's watching a play you're taking notes on, not drowning in the news cycle.

## Imperial Motto

"Vassalage for Peace. Resources for Protection. The Map is what We say it is."

## Current Board State (As of Jan 6, 2026)

- **VERCINGETORIX (Maduro):** In the Tullianum (MDC Brooklyn). Pleaded not guilty. Next hearing: March 17, 2026.
- **THE ALPS (Greenland):** Hot frontier. Denmark threatening "end of NATO" if U.S. takes it. Augustus mocking their defenses.
- **THE ANDEAN REBEL (Petro/Colombia):** On Augustus's target list. Deployed 30,000 troops to Venezuelan border. Refusing to kneel.
- **THE GALLIC TRIBUNES (Canada):** Being economically crushed by 25% tariffs. Currency sliding. Strategic value evaporating.
- **CLEOPATRA (Delcy Rodríguez):** Managing Venezuela's ruins. Offering collaboration to survive.

*Note: This is a creative analytical framework, not a political endorsement. The Roman lens is chosen for its parallels in resource management, jurisdictional expansion, and the performance of power.*
