# THE AUGUSTAN LEDGER

**Operational Reality:** Tracking current events through the lens of Augustus-era Rome.

This project applies classical Roman Empire frameworks to contemporary geopolitics, stripping away diplomatic language to expose raw power dynamics, resource extraction, and jurisdictional reaches.

## Core Concept

The "Don-roe Doctrine" (Universal U.S. Jurisdictional Reach) - a play on the Monroe Doctrine that captures the contemporary assertion of global reach.

## Structure

- `entries/` - Chronological ledger entries tracking current events
- `dramatis-personae.md` - Character mapping (current leaders → Roman archetypes)
- `settings-frontiers.md` - Geographic and strategic locations

## Philosophy

"The Republic is a ghost story. We are in the Management business now."

*Note: This is a creative analytical framework, not a political endorsement. The Roman lens is chosen for its parallels in resource management, jurisdictional expansion, and the performance of power.*
