# WRITING SAMPLE: THE AUGUSTAN TONE

*Reference for tone, style, and narrative approach*

---

Augustus sat in the back of a blacked-out carriage, the kind with the reinforced iron axles that don't rattle when you hit a pothole in the Subura. He was nursing a lukewarm cup of wine and looking at a map of the world that hadn't been updated since the Republic ate itself.

Beside him, Mark Antony—wearing a suit that cost more than a gladiator's freedom and a smirk that said he'd already seen the end of the movie—was scrolling through a tablet.

"The Canadian Province," Antony said, not looking up. "They're crying. Big, salty North Atlantic tears. Apparently, they thought we were 'partners.' Like we're members of the same country club or some shit."

Augustus didn't look at him. He just watched the rain hit the glass. "You ever go to a steakhouse, Antony? A real one. Peter Luger's type of joint."

"Once or twice."

"You don't partner with the cow, Antony. You appreciate the cow. You might even give the cow a nice place to stand while it's raining. But at the end of the day, you're there for the ribeye. And right now? Egypt just opened a butcher shop next door with lower prices and better cuts."

Five thousand miles south, in a villa that smelled like spilled diesel and expensive jasmine, Cleopatra sat across from a man in a tactical vest. Her brother was in the corner, nursing a bruised ego and a glass of contraband bourbon.

"You're missing the subtext, Delcy," the man in the vest said. He was tossing a heavy brass coin—a denarius—into the air and catching it with a wet thwack. "Augustus doesn't want your soul. He's a busy man. He's got a whole theater to run. He just wants the keys to the pump. You give him the keys, you get to keep the villa. You don't? Well, you saw what happened to Vercingetorix."

Cleopatra looked at the coin. "He's in a cage in Manhattan."

"He's in a cage in Manhattan because he thought he was the lead actor," the man said, leaning in. His breath smelled like peppermint and cold-blooded indifference. "You? You're a supporting role. And in this script, the supporting roles that survive are the ones who hit their marks and don't ad-lib the dialogue. You want to be the Queen of the Sands? Fine. But the sand belongs to Rome now."

Back in the carriage, Augustus finally turned his head. "What about the Alps? The big white rock in the North."

"Denmark's holding onto it like a virgin at a prom," Antony chuckled. "Saying it's 'not for sale.' Mentioning some treaty from the old days."

Augustus leaned back, the shadows of the Roman night dancing across his face. "The old days are over, Antony. The Republic is a ghost story we tell children so they don't get scared of the dark. Tell the Pretorians to get the gear ready. If the North is the high ground, I want my boots on it before the snow melts. And tell the Gauls in Calgary to stop calling the office. We're out of the 'friendship' business. We're in the 'management' business now."

He took a sip of the wine. It was bitter. He liked it that way.

## Style Elements

- **Scene cuts** between power centers (carriage → villa → carriage)
- **Object work** (the denarius coin, the map, the tactical vest)
- **Sensory grounding** (diesel and jasmine, peppermint breath, bitter wine)
- **Dialogue reveals character** through rhythm and word choice
- **The punchline** always lands at the end
- **Zero sentimentality** - even metaphors are clinical
- **Title cards** for transitions in markdown
