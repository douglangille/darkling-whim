# THE TAX FARMERS' PIVOT

## WASHINGTON — JANUARY 6, 2026 / 0900 EST

The Publican's coffee sat untouched. Cold.

He studied the spreadsheet on his tablet—$187 billion in additional tribute for 2025, a 200% jump. Augustus would call it "details." The numbers told a different story: the merchants absorbed 80% of the Imperial tariffs. That ratio was flipping.

"They're passing it through." His deputy stood by the window, tie loose. "JPMorgan's model shows 80-20 merchant absorption this year. By December, we're looking at 20-80."

The Publican's thumb scrolled. "The furniture delay?"

"Cabinets, pasta, chairs. White House gave no reason. Just pushed it." The deputy checked his phone. "Canadian manufacturers are calling it a win."

"They would."

Outside, a motorcade rolled past. The Publican watched it disappear. "The Gallic Tribunes hit us with 25% on steel derivatives. Doors, windows, fasteners. December 26. C$10 billion worth."

His deputy's phone buzzed. He glanced at it, pocketed it. "What's Augustus saying?"

"That it's working." The Publican set the tablet down. Face-down. "Bank of America's predicting de-escalation. Fifteen percent average by year-end."

"You believe that?"

The Publican stood. Straightened his jacket. "I believe the Supreme Court hears the case in three weeks. $130 billion in collections on the line. Most of the merchants are holding their 2026 pricing until after the ruling."

"And if it goes against us?"

The Publican picked up his cold coffee. Looked at it. Set it back down. "Augustus already hinted at more tariffs. The Tax Farmers don't stop collecting because a judge says so."

The deputy exhaled. "Goldman estimates half a point on inflation last year. Three-tenths more coming in Q1."

"That's their problem." The Publican moved toward the door. "Ours is making sure the tribute keeps coming. Whether the merchants like it or not."

He paused at the threshold. "Get me the Cabinet delay files. I want to know who called that in."

The door closed. The coffee stayed cold.

## LOWER MANHATTAN — JANUARY 5, 2026 / 1400 EST

The fund manager's corner office overlooked the harbor. Gray water. Gray sky.

"Revenue's already declining." She pointed to the screen. "$261 to $288 billion for 2025, depending on who you ask. That's the ceiling. We're past it."

Her analyst sat across from her, laptop balanced on his knee. "The Supreme Court brief lands in two weeks. If they strike it down—"

"Refunds." She cut him off. "Every business that paid gets it back. Augustus doubles down with new tariffs. Market chaos either way."

The analyst typed something. Stopped. "The merchants are already pivoting. Eighty percent absorption in 2025. They're done bleeding. Consumers take it now."

"Which means inflation."

"Which means the Fed."

She turned from the window. "What's your model showing for Q2?"

The analyst pulled up a chart. Rotated the laptop toward her. "If the Court upholds, we're looking at sustained 15% average tariffs. Moynihan's prediction. De-escalation, not escalation."

"You trust that?"

He shrugged. "I trust that Augustus doesn't care about the Senate. Or the Court. He cares about the map. Tariffs are just leverage."

She studied the chart. The projections curved downward after Q1. Optimistic. "And if he doesn't de-escalate?"

The analyst closed the laptop. "Then we're pricing in permanent realignment. Twenty percent consumer burden. Inflation sticky above three. The Empire runs hot."

She walked back to the window. A barge moved across the harbor. Slow. Deliberate. "Get me exposure to domestic manufacturing. And anything tied to tariff-exempt zones."

"Canada?"

"No." She tapped the glass. "They're too close. They'll get squeezed again. Look south. The New Aztec Queen's going to need to play ball eventually."

The analyst stood. "You think he'll invade?"

She didn't turn around. "I think the P-8 Poseidon is already watching. Invasion's just a word for when the paperwork catches up."

He left. She stayed at the window. The barge disappeared into the mist.

## CALGARY — JANUARY 6, 2026 / 0700 MST

The resource executive's phone lit up. Another alert. The Loonie dropped another half-point overnight.

His partner set down her mug. "The tariff pause is temporary. You know that."

"I know furniture and cabinets got pushed to 2027. That's twelve months." He scrolled through the alerts. "Gives us time."

"Time for what?" She leaned back. "Augustus just captured Vercingetorix. Venezuelan oil's flooding the market. We're redundant."

He looked up. "We're not redundant."

"We're expensive. There's a difference." She picked up her mug. Held it with both hands. "The Tax Farmers delayed the tariffs because they don't need the revenue yet. Once the Venezuelan fields are fully online—"

"That's six months minimum."

"Which gives us six months to diversify or die." She sipped. "What's the export forecast for Q1?"

He pulled up the file. Scanned it. "Down 8% year-over-year. Currency's killing us before the tariffs even hit."

His phone buzzed again. He ignored it. "What's Ottawa saying?"

"That they're negotiating. That the 25% steel derivative tariffs are 'proportional response.' That we have leverage."

He laughed. Cold. "We have leverage?"

"That's the line." She set the mug down. "The reality is Augustus isn't negotiating. He's dictating. And the Supreme Court case might blow the whole thing up anyway."

"Or make it permanent."

She nodded. "That too."

He closed the file. Looked out the window. The Rockies in the distance. White-capped. Indifferent. "How long do we have?"

"Before what?"

"Before the Tax Farmers decide we're tribute instead of trade partners."

She stood. Walked to the window. Stood beside him. "We're already tribute. The question is how much we pay."

The mountains didn't answer.

## THE STRATEGIC LEDGER

### THE TRIBUTE MACHINE

**The Flip:** In 2025, American merchants absorbed 80% of Augustus's tariff costs. That's ending. JPMorgan projects the burden shifting to consumers—from 80% merchant absorption to just 20% by late 2026. Translation: prices rise. The Empire's tariff revenue hit $187 billion in 2025, nearly triple the prior year. But the machine is already slowing: various estimates peg total 2025 collections between $261-$288 billion, and the trend line points down.

### THE STRATEGIC PAUSE

Augustus delayed major tariffs on furniture, cabinets, and Italian pasta at the start of 2026. No official explanation. Canadian manufacturers received a separate reprieve: kitchen cabinet tariff hikes pushed to 2027. Meanwhile, Canada struck back with 25% tariffs on C$10 billion worth of steel derivatives—doors, windows, fasteners—effective December 26, 2025.

### THE COURT CHALLENGE

The Supreme Court case threatens to overturn Augustus's most extensive tariffs, which have generated approximately $130 billion through mid-December 2025. Most businesses are delaying 2026 pricing decisions until the ruling drops. If the Court strikes down the tariffs, refunds flow. Augustus has already hinted he'll impose additional tariffs in response.

### THE INFLATION TAX

Goldman Sachs economists calculate Augustus's tariffs added 0.5 percentage points to inflation in 2025. They project another 0.3 points in the first half of 2026. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan predicts "de-escalation, not escalation," with average tariffs settling around 15%. The market isn't convinced.

### THE PROVINCIAL SQUEEZE

The Gallic Tribunes (Canada) are watching their currency lose 5% of its value in weeks. With Venezuelan oil (Vercingetorix's capture) coming online, Canadian energy exports face permanent redundancy. Alberta's resource sector is projecting Q1 exports down 8% year-over-year—before the full tariff regime even lands.

**Source:** National Post (January 2, 2026), Blakes Law Firm (December 18, 2025)

### THE IMPERIAL CALCULUS

The Tax Farmers (Lighthizer/Greer) aren't collecting tribute for revenue. They're collecting it for leverage. Tariffs are the tool. The map is the goal. Whether the Supreme Court rules for or against, Augustus has already signaled he'll keep squeezing. The Provinces (Canada/Mexico) can pay in currency, resources, or sovereignty. The Empire doesn't care which.
