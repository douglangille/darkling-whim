# THE SEVEN KINGS

## THE SEVEN KINGS — JANUARY 6, 2026

The joint statement hits the wire at dawn. Seven signatures. France, Germany, Britain, Italy, Spain, Poland, Denmark. The language is diplomatic, but the message lands like a shield wall forming: "Greenland belongs to its people."

Emmanuel Macron's name sits first. Then Friedrich Merz, Giorgia Meloni, Donald Tusk, Pedro Sánchez, Keir Starmer, Mette Frederiksen. They don't name Augustus directly—professional courtesy, the last vestige—but the text leaves no room for interpretation. "It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland."

The Danish Prime Minister's office releases it on X. The statement emphasizes Arctic security as "a key priority for Europe" and notes that "The Kingdom of Denmark — including Greenland — is part of NATO." The unspoken clause hangs in the air: Attack one, attack all.

## AIR FORCE ONE — JANUARY 5, 2026

Augustus leans back in his chair, 35,000 feet over the Atlantic. "We need Greenland from a national security situation," he tells reporters. His voice carries that familiar dismissive edge when discussing allies who don't understand power. "Denmark is not going to be able to do it."

Someone asks about timing.

"We'll worry about Greenland in about two months," Augustus says. Then the adjustment, the tell that he's already decided. "Let's talk about Greenland in 20 days."

He mocks Denmark's defense buildup—the ships, the jets, the new Arctic command headquarters they announced in October. "You know what they did recently to boost up on Greenland?" Augustus grins. "They added one more dog sled."

## THE WHITE HOUSE — JANUARY 5, 2026

The Imperial Architect (Stephen Miller) sits for CNN. Cold studio lights. The question comes: Should Greenland be part of the United States?

"That's the formal position of the U.S. government," Miller says flatly. No hedging. No diplomatic language about "exploring options" or "strategic partnerships." Just the raw assertion. "For the United States to secure the Arctic region, to protect and defend NATO and NATO interests, obviously Greenland should be part of the United States."

The Euronews crew catches him later. Someone pushes: Would anyone actually fight over this?

Miller's response is immediate: No one would.

## COPENHAGEN — JANUARY 5, 2026

Frederiksen watches the Miller interview. Her office has been fielding calls from Washington for days—reassurances, threats disguised as warnings, the familiar American pattern. She decides to end the ambiguity.

"If the United States chooses to launch an attack on another NATO country, then everything stops," she tells the press. No careful phrasing. No diplomatic off-ramps. "Any US attack on Greenland would spell the end of NATO."

She'd already told Augustus directly to "stop the threats." He responded by doubling down from Air Force One.

## THE TULLIANUM — JANUARY 6, 2026

Vercingetorix (Maduro) shuffles into the Manhattan courthouse in blue prison uniform, ankles shackled, limping. The helicopter transfer from MDC Brooklyn started at 7:15 AM—motorcade to athletic field, chopper across New York harbor, armored vehicle to the courthouse.

Inside, he greets the room: "Happy New Year."

When his turn comes, he introduces himself carefully. "I am the president of Venezuela," he tells Judge Alvin Hellerstein. Then the addition: "And a prisoner of war."

His wife Cilia Flores stands beside him. Right eye swollen. Forehead bandaged. Visible injuries from the extraction. Maduro's legal team requests X-rays for what they suspect is a fractured rib.

"I'm innocent. I am not guilty. I am a decent man, the president of my country," Maduro tells the court.

Someone in the gallery shouts: "You pay in name of Venezuelan people."

Maduro turns. "I am a man of God."

Not guilty pleas entered. Next appearance: March 17.

## MAR-A-LAGO — JANUARY 5, 2026

Augustus speaks to The Atlantic between rounds of golf. The reporter asks about Cleopatra (Delcy Rodríguez), whether she's cooperating with the occupation.

"If she doesn't," Augustus says, "she will face a very hefty price, likely greater than Maduro's."

He confirms the US will "run" Venezuela for "a period of time." How long? Unspecified. Mark Antony (Rubio) has already announced oil export restrictions remain in place, more vessel strikes possible.

Someone mentions boots on the ground.

"Unafraid," Augustus replies.
