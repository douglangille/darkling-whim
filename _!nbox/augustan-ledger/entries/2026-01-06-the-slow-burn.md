# THE SLOW BURN

## THE CAPITOL — JANUARY 20, 2025

Augustus stands in the Oval Office signing his name. The proclamation reads "Grave National Injustice." His hand moves across the parchment faster than his advisors expected. They wanted case-by-case review, surgical precision, political cover. He waved them off.

"Fuck it. Release 'em all."

Fifteen hundred pardons. Full clemency. The ones who beat cops with flagpoles, the ones who dragged officers into the mob, the militia commanders convicted of seditious conspiracy—all walking tonight. Stewart Rhodes, the Oath Keeper who planned the breach, gets his sentence commuted to time served. The Justice Department receives orders: drop all pending cases immediately.

Augustus calls them "hostages."

The vigil outside the DC jail erupts. Livestreams show supporters weeping, cheering, phones lighting up with release notifications. Someone starts singing the national anthem—the same recording Augustus played at his rallies, voices of the convicted echoing through arenas. The police officers who held the line, who testified about crushed vertebrae and suffocation, watch from home. One hundred forty injured. Nine dead when you count the suicides.

"We hope they'll be released tonight, to be honest," Augustus says to the cameras, pen still in hand.

## THE LEGION ENCAMPMENTS — JANUARY 2026

The ICE officers work their shifts differently now. Assaults on federal agents are up 1,150% year-over-year. Not just protests—targeted attacks, coordinated ambushes, officers pulled from vehicles. The Department of Homeland Security tracks each incident in spreadsheets that now require pagination.

Former FBI agent Jonathan Gilliam sits for an interview. Cold fluorescent light. Coffee gone lukewarm. "Political violence, as we know it now, has just started," he says. He ticks through the list: Charlie Kirk assassinated in September, bullets engraved with "Hey fascist, catch." Two attempts on Augustus before he reclaimed the throne. Jewish community centers. Christian dialogue events shut down with force.

The DHS now issues "Terror Threat Snapshots" for domestic extremists using the same frameworks they built for ISIS. Lone actors. Small cells. Decentralized command structures designed to evade surveillance. The intelligence community's assessment is clinical: domestic violent extremists are more likely to strike than foreign terrorist organizations.

## THE SENATE FLOOR — JANUARY 6, 2026

Rep. Jamie Raskin stands at his desk. Papers stacked. Voice measured. "We are still in the throes of the political fight that took place on Jan. 6," he tells the reporter from NOTUS. Around him, colleagues are calculating whether to acknowledge the fifth anniversary or ignore it. The pardoned rioters are back on social media, some already arrested again.

Raskin continues: "The violence is a product of the profound political division and the determination some people have to win regardless of the means used." He doesn't say "civil war." None of them do. But the metrics are there in the DHS assessments: radicalization accelerating online, encrypted channels coordinating action, generative AI lowering the barrier for cyber-attacks on infrastructure.

Former Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger, who took over six months after the breach, remembers officers arriving at his door. Frustrated. Injured. Telling him they lacked equipment and training for what hit them. Now those same officers watch Augustus pardon their attackers on primetime television.

One officer, Aquilino Gonell, testified about being dragged into the mob by his shoulder straps. Nearly suffocated. Injuries that won't heal. He's still waiting for someone to use the word he won't say on camera.
