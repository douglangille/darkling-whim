# THE ALPS ULTIMATUM

## AIR FORCE ONE — JANUARY 5, 2026

Augustus leans back in the leather chair, thirty-eight thousand feet over the Atlantic, watching the clouds slide beneath the fuselage like provinces on a map. The coffee's gone cold in the cup. Doesn't matter. He's already said what needed saying to the press pool crammed into the back of the plane.

"Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place."

One of the junior staffers—fresh out of Georgetown, tie still knotted tight—clears his throat. "Sir, the Danes might—"

Augustus waves him off. "You know what Denmark did recently to boost up security in Greenland?"

The kid waits.

"They added one more dog sled."

Silence. Then Augustus grins. "It's true. They thought that was a great move."

The laughter comes quick from his side of the cabin. The Georgetown kid's smile is nervous. The reporters stay quiet, fingers moving on their phones, the quote already ricocheting through the networks before the wheels touch down.

Mark Antony—Rubio—sits across the aisle, leather briefing folder unopened on his lap. He doesn't laugh. He's been counting the cost of jokes like that since Vercingetorix came off the plane in flexicuffs.

"The Danes are NATO," Rubio says, quiet enough that only Augustus hears.

Augustus takes a sip of cold coffee, grimaces, sets it down. "So was Vercingetorix."

"He wasn't—"

"Details, Marco. Details." Augustus taps the armrest. "Katie posted the picture. Greenland in red, white, and blue. You see it?"

Rubio nods. Katie Miller—the Imperial Architect's wife—had dropped it Saturday morning. One word caption: SOON.

"I didn't tell her to do that," Augustus says, still grinning. "But I didn't tell her not to."

Outside the window, the ocean is grey steel. Somewhere down there, Russian submarines are sliding through the GIUK Gap like sharks.

Augustus leans forward. "We need Greenland. National security. Say it with me, Marco."

Rubio doesn't say it. He opens the briefing folder instead.

## COPENHAGEN — JANUARY 6, 2026

Mette Frederiksen sits in the TV2 studio, the lights hot on her face, the microphone clipped to her collar. Her chief of staff is in the control booth, watching through glass. He's already sent her the clip—Augustus on the plane, the dog sled line, the laughter.

The interviewer leans in. "Prime Minister, the United States has made it clear they want Greenland. How does Denmark respond?"

Frederiksen's jaw tightens. She's rehearsed this. Worked the phrasing with the Foreign Ministry until three in the morning. But now, with the lights in her eyes and Augustus's voice still ringing in her ears, the diplomatic script feels like tissue paper.

"If the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily," she says, each word landing like a hammer, "then everything stops."

The interviewer blinks. "Everything?"

"Everything. Including our NATO membership and thus the security that has been provided since the end of the Second World War."

She lets it sit there. No qualifiers. No escape hatches.

The interviewer recovers. "You're saying NATO would end?"

"I'm saying," Frederiksen says, leaning forward, "that you cannot have a military alliance where one member attacks another. That's not an alliance. That's a protection racket."

The phrase hangs in the air. Protection racket. The control booth goes quiet.

Frederiksen knows Augustus is watching—someone in his orbit will clip it, send it up. Good. She needs him to understand there's a cage in this negotiation, and it's not just for chieftains from the Orinoco.

But she also knows what Vercingetorix looked like stepping off that C-17 in Florida. Flexicuffs. Tactical vests. The full theater of Roman jurisdiction reaching seven thousand miles to put hands on a sovereign head of state.

The dog sled joke isn't entirely wrong. Denmark added surveillance. Some drones. The Arctic package was $2.3 billion spread over five years. Augustus probably spent that on the Venezuelan operation before breakfast.

Her chief of staff texts from the booth: *Strong. Maybe too strong?*

She doesn't reply.

## NUUK, GREENLAND — JANUARY 4, 2026

Jens-Frederik Nielsen stands at the podium, the Greenlandic flag behind him, the wind rattling the windows of the government building. His communications director had suggested a blue tie. Nielsen wore red instead. Fuck the optics.

"Enough is enough," he says, and his voice carries more edge than the staffers expected. "No more pressure. No more hints. No more fantasies about annexation."

A reporter from Reuters raises her hand. "Mr. Prime Minister, President Trump says you're covered in Russian and Chinese ships—"

"Where?" Nielsen cuts her off. "Show me. I'll wait."

The reporter hesitates.

"Because I've been to the coast," Nielsen continues. "I've flown the routes. I know what's in our waters. And you know what I see? Danish patrol boats. Greenlandic fishing vessels. And the occasional Russian research ship that stays in international waters because *that's the law*."

He leans into the microphone. "Greenland is our home and our territory. That's not a negotiating position. That's geography."

The cameras are rolling. Nielsen knows this clip will play in Washington, probably in the Oval Office. Maybe Mar-a-Lago if Augustus is bored.

But Nielsen also knows the math. His entire population—57,000 souls—would fit inside a mid-sized Roman stadium. The rare earths under the ice are worth more than the GDP of every nation within a thousand miles. Nickel doesn't vote. Cobalt doesn't have rights.

Augustus said it Sunday: "We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security."

Need. Not want. Not prefer. Not "would like to discuss."

*Need.*

The word does all the work.

## MAR-A-LAGO — THE THRONE ROOM

The Imperial Architect—Stephen Miller—sits across from Augustus, tablet open between them showing the GIUK Gap in high resolution. The maritime corridor between Greenland, Iceland, and Scotland where Russian submarines slide through the black water like knives through silk.

"Jeff Landry," Augustus says, tapping the screen. "Louisiana Governor. Sharp. Understands extraction. Knows how to talk to people who think they own things they don't."

Miller nods. "Special Envoy?"

"Special Envoy to Greenland," Augustus confirms. "Let him lead the charge. Smile, handshake, explain the terms."

"And if they don't take the terms?"

Augustus sips his coffee—fresh this time, hot, the way he likes it. "Then we adjust the terms."

Miller swipes to the next slide. Mineral deposits. Nickel veins running through the bedrock like arteries. Cobalt. Lithium. Rare earths that make the Parthian King's supply chains look like a garage sale.

"Denmark says we attack them, NATO ends," Miller says.

Augustus doesn't look up from the screen. "NATO's a piece of paper. The Alps are geology."

"Frederiksen called it a protection racket."

Now Augustus looks up. "Did she?"

"On Danish TV. This morning."

Augustus leans back, something like respect flickering across his face. "Huh. Smart lady. Wrong side of history, but smart."

Miller closes the tablet. "Landry leaves in three days. What's his opening offer?"

Augustus stares out the window at the Atlantic. Palm trees swaying. Security detail in sunglasses walking the perimeter. Somewhere north of here, the Northern Chieftains are trying to figure out how to hold a wall they can't afford to man.

"Tell Landry to be generous," Augustus says. "Offer them money. Infrastructure. A naval base with their flag on it. Make it sound like partnership."

"And when they say no?"

Augustus drains the coffee. "Then we stop being generous."

Miller stands. "Twenty days?"

Augustus nods. "Clock's running."

Miller heads for the door, then pauses. "Katie's post—the 'SOON' thing—that was her idea?"

Augustus grins. "I married well."

Miller leaves. Augustus stays at the table, eyes back on the map. Greenland sits there like a chunk of ice that someone left on the board by mistake. 836,000 square miles. Fifty-seven thousand people. Trillions in mineral wealth.

The Danish Prime Minister can threaten all she wants. NATO is a treaty. The Alps are geology. And nickel doesn't care about alliances.

The only question left is whether Denmark figures that out before Rome has to show them.
