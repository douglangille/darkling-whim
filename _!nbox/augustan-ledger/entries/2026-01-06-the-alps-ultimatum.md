# THE ALPS ULTIMATUM

## AIR FORCE ONE — JANUARY 5, 2026

Augustus leans back in the leather chair, thirty-eight thousand feet over the Atlantic, watching the clouds slide beneath the fuselage like provinces on a map. The coffee's gone cold in the cup. Doesn't matter. He's already said what needed saying to the press pool crammed into the back of the plane.

"Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place."

The sentence lands clean. No hedging. No diplomatic gauze. He can see the reporters typing it into their devices, the words already moving through the networks before the wheels touch down at Andrews.

He adds the punchline: "You know what Denmark did recently to boost up security in Greenland? They added one more dog sled. It's true. They thought that was a great move."

The laughter comes quick from his side of the cabin. The reporters stay quiet, fingers moving.

Outside the window, the ocean is grey steel. The Imperial Architect's wife—Katie Miller—had posted the image Saturday morning. Greenland's coastline rendered in red, white, and blue. One word caption: SOON.

Augustus didn't tell her to do it. Didn't need to. The board is already moving.

## COPENHAGEN — JANUARY 6, 2026

Mette Frederiksen sits in the TV2 studio, the lights hot on her face, the microphone clipped to her collar. The interviewer asks the question she knew was coming since the Venezuelan operation forty-eight hours ago.

"If the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops."

She lets it hang there. No qualifiers. No diplomatic padding.

"Including our NATO and thus the security that has been provided since the end of the Second World War."

The words are a firebreak. A line drawn in permafrost. She knows Augustus is watching—someone in his orbit will clip it, send it up the chain. She needs him to understand: there is a cage in this negotiation, and it's not just for chieftains from the Orinoco.

But she also knows what Vercingetorix looked like stepping off that C-17 in Florida. Flexicuffs. Tactical vests. The full theater of Roman jurisdiction reaching seven thousand miles to put hands on a sovereign head of state.

The dog sled joke isn't entirely wrong. Denmark added surveillance. Some drones. The Arctic package was $2.3 billion over five years. Augustus probably spends that on a weekend at Mar-a-Lago.

## NUUK, GREENLAND — JANUARY 4, 2026

Jens-Frederik Nielsen stands at the podium, the Greenlandic flag behind him, the wind rattling the windows of the government building. His jaw is set. He's said versions of this before, but the Venezuelan seizure changed the stakes.

"Enough is enough. No more pressure. No more hints. No more fantasies about annexation."

He pauses, making sure the cameras get it.

"Greenland is our home and our territory. And that's how it continues to be."

He means it. All 57,000 of them mean it. But Nielsen also knows the math. His entire population would fit inside a mid-sized Roman stadium. The rare earths under the ice—nickel, cobalt, lithium—are worth more than GDP of every nation within a thousand miles.

Augustus said it Sunday: "We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security."

Need. Not want. Not prefer.

Need.

The word does work.

## MAR-A-LAGO — THE THRONE ROOM

The Imperial Architect sits across from Augustus, a tablet open between them showing the GIUK Gap—the maritime corridor between Greenland, Iceland, and Scotland where Russian submarines slide through the black water like knives.

"Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry," Augustus says, tapping the screen. "Special Envoy to Greenland. He understands the board."

The Imperial Architect nods. Landry's already been briefed. The play isn't invasion—not yet. It's pressure until the Northern Chieftains realize they can't hold the wall. Can't patrol the coast. Can't extract the minerals fast enough to matter.

Rome doesn't need to take the Alps by force. Rome just needs to make Denmark understand that holding it is more expensive than letting go.

The coffee's fresh now. Augustus drinks it hot, eyes on the map.

The Danish Prime Minister can threaten NATO's dissolution all she wants. But NATO is a treaty. The Alps are geology. Nickel doesn't care about alliances.

"Twenty days," the Imperial Architect says quietly.

Augustus nods. The clock's already running.
