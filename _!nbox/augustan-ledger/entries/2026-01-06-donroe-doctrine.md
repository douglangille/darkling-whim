# THE DONROE DOCTRINE
*January 6, 2026*

## CAPITOL HILL — 0915 HOURS

Augustus arrived at the Kennedy Center—renamed in his honor three weeks prior—with the morning cold still sharp on his face. The building's marble lobby held thirty House Republicans arranged in theater seats, tablets glowing in the dim light. No cameras. Private strategy session.

"Five years ago today," Augustus said, standing center stage, hands at his sides. "Democrats held an investigation. Cost you your majority."

Representative Mills from Georgia shifted in her seat. "Mr. President, they're holding another hearing this afternoon—"

"Details." Augustus waved it off. "They'll talk about what happened. We talk about what we're doing."

Behind him, a staffer advanced slides on the projection screen. Venezuela oil fields. Greenland mineral deposits. Maps with arrows.

"The 2020 election was rigged," Augustus continued, same words he'd used a thousand times. "They know it. We know it. But today we're discussing the Monroe Doctrine. My version." He paused. "The *Donroe* Doctrine."

A few chuckles. Representative Torres frowned.

"American dominance in the western hemisphere," Augustus said, "will never be questioned again."

Was he talking about the riot?

Torres raised her hand.

"Not now," Augustus said.

## WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING ROOM — 1345 HOURS

Press Secretary Leavitt stood at the podium, the seal bright behind her. Forty reporters, phones ready. The Venezuela question came first.

"The President has been clear," Leavitt said. Her voice carried the practiced rhythm of someone who'd delivered the same message six times already. "Acquiring Venezuela's oil infrastructure is vital to American interests."

A reporter from *The Times* stood. "The UN Security Council called the Maduro abduction illegal—"

"Next question."

"—Russia and China walked out of the session—"

"The President," Leavitt cut in, fingers tight on the podium edge, "authorized the operation under Article Two authority. We captured a narco-terrorist who stole American oil assets. We're rebuilding what's ours."

Hands shot up across the room.

"On Greenland," Leavitt continued before anyone could speak. "President Trump has made it abundantly clear that acquiring Greenland is a national security imperative. The President and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal."

The AP correspondent leaned forward. "Is military force on the table?"

Leavitt's pause lasted two seconds. Long enough.

"Of course, utilizing the U.S. Military is always an option at the Commander in Chief's disposal."

The room erupted. She pointed to another reporter, ignored the shouting.

## AIR FORCE ONE — 1730 HOURS

Augustus sat in the forward cabin, tie loosened, watching the clouds through double-paned glass. General Caine stood near the bulkhead, briefing folder unopened in his hands.

"Greenland's prime minister issued a statement," Caine said. "One word. '*Enough.*'"

Augustus picked up his phone, scrolled. "Denmark?"

"Quiet. Waiting for Europe to respond."

"Europe." Augustus set the phone down. "Senator Gallego's introducing a resolution to stop us from invading Greenland. You see that?"

"I saw it."

"He thinks we need Congress." Augustus looked out the window again. The sky was darkening, East Coast below. "Miller told CNN nobody's going to war over Greenland's future. He's right."

Caine shifted his weight. "Mr. President, the planning parameters—"

"Details." Augustus waved. "We took Maduro out of his compound with helicopters. Saturday night. Clean. Two injured, both recovering." He turned back to Caine. "That's what matters. Results."

"Venezuela's different than Greenland."

"Not really." Augustus stood, straightened his tie. "Monroe Doctrine. Donroe Doctrine. Same principle. We say what happens in this hemisphere." He walked to the cabin door, stopped. "The Democrats can spend all day talking about January 6. Five years ago. Ancient history." His hand rested on the doorframe. "We're talking about oil. About the Arctic. About what comes next."

Caine stayed silent.

"Schedule something with Greenland's people," Augustus said. "Diplomatic first. But have the other plans ready."

## CAPITOL STEPS — 1815 HOURS

The Democrats gathered in the cold—senators, representatives, former Capitol Police. The dome loomed behind them, floodlit against the evening sky. Senator Schumer spoke into microphones about democracy, about memory, about accountability.

Inside the building, Republicans had already left for dinner.

The crowd on the steps numbered maybe forty. Tourists stopped to watch, took photos, moved on.

Former Officer Dunn spoke about the injuries, the fear, the betrayal. His voice cracked once. The microphone caught it.

Up Pennsylvania Avenue, lights came on in office buildings. Traffic moved. The city kept working.

Five years.

Tomorrow would be a regular Wednesday.
