# THE MORNING BRIEFING (JANUARY 6, 2026)

## I. THE TULLIANUM (NOON, JANUARY 5)

The cage smelled like industrial bleach and yesterday's fear. Vercingetorix—wearing a blue prison uniform that hung loose on his frame—shuffled into the Manhattan federal courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. The headphones were too big. The translator's voice crackled in his ear, turning English legal jargon into Spanish that meant the same thing: You're finished.

"I'm president of the Republic of Venezuela and I'm here kidnapped since 3 January, Saturday," Maduro said, his voice rising before Judge Alvin Hellerstein cut him off like a script supervisor stopping a bad take.

"I was captured at my home in Caracas, Venezuela."

The courtroom was silent. Then a man in the gallery—one of the victims who'd flown up from Miami to watch—shouted something about justice. About crimes. About time.

Maduro turned. His eyes were the eyes of a chieftain who'd lost the war but hadn't figured out the script was over. "I am a prisoner of war," he shot back before the marshals led him out.

His wife, Cilia Flores, sat beside him in the same blue uniform, nursing broken ribs from the Saturday raid. She said nothing. Just pleaded "Not Guilty" through the translator and stared at the wall.

Next court date: March 17, 2026. Charges: Narco-terrorism. Cocaine importation. Weapons. Maximum sentence: Life.

Outside, the protesters held signs that said "Free Pres. Maduro" and "No War for Venezuelan Oil." They were outnumbered by the counter-protesters who'd waited years for this.

## II. THE ALPS (SUNDAY EVENING, GREENLAND)

Augustus was on a plane back to Washington when a reporter asked him about Denmark. About NATO. About the fact that the Northern Chieftains were screaming "no more fantasies" like children who think tantrums work on empire.

He laughed. Not a warm laugh. The kind of laugh you hear in a steakhouse when someone orders the steak well-done.

"We need Greenland for national security," he said, looking out the window like he was already measuring the coastline for docks. "It's incredibly strategic right now. Greenland is inundated with Russian and Chinese vessels."

Someone asked about Denmark's defense commitment.

"Do you know what Denmark did recently?" Trump grinned. "To strengthen security in Greenland, they added a dog sled. It's true. They thought that was a great reinforcement."

The reporters scribbled. The quote would be on every European front page by morning.

## III. THE NORTHERN WALL (COPENHAGEN, MORNING OF JANUARY 6)

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen sat in her office, staring at a phone that hadn't stopped ringing since Saturday. The call she wanted—from Augustus—never came. The calls she didn't want—from Brussels, from Berlin, from every panicked EU capital—wouldn't stop.

She issued the statement herself. Cold. Clear. The kind of thing you say when you're out of cards but still have a microphone.

"A U.S. attack on Greenland would mark the end of NATO."

Six European leaders signed a joint statement an hour later. France. Germany. Italy. Poland. Spain. The United Kingdom. All saying the same thing in diplomatic language that translated to: *Please don't do this. We need you. But Greenland isn't on the menu*.

"Greenland belongs to its people," the statement read. "It is solely up to Denmark and Greenland to make decisions regarding their affairs."

Augustus didn't respond. He was already looking south.

## IV. THE ANDEAN TARGET (BOGOTÁ, MONDAY)

Gustavo Petro sat in the presidential palace, watching CNN's live feed of Maduro in chains. His phone buzzed. An aide handed him a tablet. Trump had just called him out by name. Called him "a very bad guy." Said he was involved in "massive drug production." Threatened to cut military aid. Threatened worse.

Petro stood up. He wasn't Maduro. He wasn't going quietly.

"Every Colombian soldier has now received this directive," he wrote on X, his fingers hammering the keyboard. "Any security force commander who prioritizes the U.S. flag over the Colombian flag will be immediately dismissed from the institution."

He looked at the map. Venezuela to the east. The Caribbean to the north. U.S. military assets everywhere. He added one more line: "I have urged the populace to defend the president against any illegitimate acts of violence."

Colombia's defense minister tried to walk it back an hour later, talking about "ongoing collaboration" with the U.S. military, the DEA, the FBI. But Petro had already sent 30,000 troops to the Venezuelan border.

The Andean Rebel wasn't bending the knee. And Augustus had just put him on notice.

**The Board:** The cage is full. The Alps are heating up. The Andean Rebel just painted a target on his back. And Augustus is drinking his coffee, watching the map, and deciding who's next.
