# MASTER CONFIGURATION: IPAD MINI & IPHONE 13 "PAPER MODE"

## 1. STRATEGIC OVERVIEW
The "Paper Mode" setup re-engineers high-stimulation Apple devices into focused, analog-style tools. It leverages neurobiological principles to reduce dopamine triggers and hardware-specific settings to mimic E-Ink displays.

## 2. THE "PAPER MODE" SHORTCUT (One-Tap Toggle)
Build this shortcut to instantly transform the device personality. Use the "Toggle" setting for all accessibility actions.

- **Color Filters:** Set to **Grayscale** (Removes the "slot machine" reward of color).
- **Reduce Transparency:** **ON** (Flattens the UI; removes distracting glass/blur effects).
- **Increase Contrast:** **ON** (Sharpens text and button outlines against gray backgrounds).
- **Differentiate Without Color:** **ON** (Adds shapes/icons to replace color-coded data).
- **Reduce White Point:** **ON** (Kills the "fluorescent glow" of the LCD/OLED).
- **Set Brightness:** **25%** (Sets a consistent, non-stimulating starting luminosity).

## 3. HARDWARE-SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATION
### iPad mini (LCD Screen)
- **Wallpaper:** Solid Color HEX **#7D7D7D** (Medium Gray).
- **Appearance:** **Auto** (Follows sun; Light Mode for day reading is superior for focus).
- **Rationale:** Gray hides LCD backlight bleed and mimics recycled paper texture.

### iPhone 13 (OLED Screen)
- **Wallpaper:** Solid Color HEX **#000000** (Pure Black).
- **Appearance:** **Permanent Dark Mode**.
- **Rationale:** OLED pixels turn OFF on black, saving ~15-40% battery and making the hardware/notch visually "disappear."

## 4. SYSTEM-WIDE INTEGRATION
- **App Icons:** Set to **"Dark + Auto."** Provides high-contrast silhouettes that are more legible in Grayscale than standard colored icons.
- **Notifications:** **Disabled Globally.** Forces a "Pull" workflow (you check the tool) rather than a "Push" workflow (the tool distracts you).
- **Triple-Click Shortcut:** Set to **Reduce White Point.** Serves as a manual "extra dim" layer for night utility without activating the full Paper Mode.
- **iPhone Focus Filter:** Link Paper Mode settings to a specific Focus Mode (e.g., "Deep Work") to automate the transition.

## 5. TACTICAL PROTOCOL
- **Primary Use (90%):** Paper Mode ON. Ideal for reading, writing, and intentional utility.
- **Escape Hatch (10%):** Toggle OFF for Maps (navigation), Photo/Video (editing), or websites with broken CSS contrast.
