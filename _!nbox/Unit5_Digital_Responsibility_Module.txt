Segment 1: Safe Digital Habits

Why It Matters
Digital safety isn’t just about protecting NSCC systems — it’s about protecting you. Whether you're checking email, logging into Brightspace, or using your phone at home, your habits shape your risk.

Passwords & Authentication
Good Practice:
- Use long, memorable passphrases (e.g., “CoffeeIsLife@7am”)

Common Missteps:
- Writing passwords on sticky notes
- Using “NSCC2023!” for everything
- Ignoring MFA prompts because “it’s annoying”

Device Updates
Good Practice:
- Keep your operating system and apps updated
- Restart your device regularly to apply patches
- Use antivirus software (NSCC-managed devices already have this)

Common Missteps:
- Clicking “Remind Me Later” for weeks
- Using unsupported browsers or outdated plugins

Scam & Phishing Awareness
Good Practice:
- Check sender addresses carefully
- Hover over links before clicking
- Report suspicious emails to NSCC IT

Common Missteps:
- Clicking “urgent” links without checking
- Downloading attachments from unknown senders

Hey — Doug here.
Let’s talk about digital habits. Not the flashy stuff — just the basics that keep you and NSCC safe.
Strong passwords. Device updates. Spotting sketchy emails. These aren’t just IT rules — they’re everyday habits that protect your work, your students, and your personal info.
NSCC requires all employees to complete Beauceron Cyber Awareness Training. It’s short, practical, and yes — actually useful.
If you haven’t done it yet, go knock it out. It’s part of being a responsible digital citizen here.

Segment 2: Ethical Online Behaviour

Why It Matters
Digital spaces are shared spaces. Your actions reflect your values — and NSCC’s expectations.

Media Script
Doug Video: “Trust and Tech Ethics”
Ethics online isn’t just about avoiding trouble — it’s about trust.
When you post in Brightspace, email a colleague, or handle student data, you’re building (or breaking) trust.
Respectful communication matters. So does academic integrity. And yes, citing your sources applies even in discussion posts.
NSCC has policies to guide you — but the real question is: what kind of digital citizen do you want to be?

Where does your digital footprint show up — and what does it say about you?

Media Script
Doug Audio: “Digital Footprint Gone Wrong”
Quick story.
A colleague once posted a classroom photo on social media — didn’t blur faces, didn’t ask permission.
It seemed harmless… until a student flagged it. Privacy breach.
Your digital footprint isn’t just what you post — it’s what others see, share, and remember.
So before you hit “share,” ask: is this mine to post? And what does it say about me?

Media Script
Doug Audio: “Where to Find Help”
NSCC has your back — but only if you know where to look.
The Technology Service Desk is your go-to for tech issues. Copilot (that’s me) can help with questions. And LinkedIn Learning is great for brushing up on skills.
Policies like Acceptable Use and Generative AI Guidelines aren’t just red tape — they’re there to protect you and the college.
So take a few minutes to explore them. You’ll be glad you did.
