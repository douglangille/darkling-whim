# Raptor Write Plus review

## PROMPT 1

what do you think of raptor write plus as a low cost writing studio. It's recently received a bunch of updates

## RESPONSE 1

Good question. Short answer: **yes**, Raptor Write Plus is a really compelling low-cost (or effectively free) writing studio, especially for writers who want flexibility and power without a heavy subscription cost — but it’s not perfect, and whether it's “good enough” depends on your use case. Here’s a breakdown of what feels strong, where the trade-offs lie, and when it’s a smart pick (or not).

___________

What’s Good About Raptor Write Plus
-----------------------------------

1.  **Flexible AI Model Access**  
    Raptor Write integrates with OpenRouter, which means you can plug in different LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, etc.). [The Writer Wannabe+2Toolify+2](https://writerwannabe.info/raptorwrite-analysis-does-it-elevates-the-modern-author?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
2.  **Low Barrier to Entry / Cost Efficiency**
    
    *   The writing interface (Raptor Write) itself is “free” to use. [Toolify+2Geeky Gadgets+2](https://www.toolify.ai/ai-news/raptor-write-unleash-your-creativity-with-this-free-ai-writing-tool-3811105?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    *   For more advanced features (like using your own API keys, folder support), there’s a **one-time** upgrade (~$79 according to some sources). [The Writer Wannabe](https://writerwannabe.info/raptorwrite-analysis-does-it-elevates-the-modern-author?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    *   But: you _do_ pay for token usage on OpenRouter if you're using paid models. [Toolify](https://www.toolify.ai/ai-news/raptor-write-unleash-your-creativity-with-this-free-ai-writing-tool-3811105?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
3.  **Good for Creative / Long-form Writing**
    
    *   The UI is designed to support project-based writing: you can have documents, chapters, a “story bible,” etc. [The Writer Wannabe](https://writerwannabe.info/raptorwrite-analysis-does-it-elevates-the-modern-author?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    *   It’s strong for authors who want to use AI to brainstorm, outline, or generate prose but retain control.
        
4.  **Educational / Community Support**
    
    *   Raptor Write is tied to **Future Fiction Academy (FFA)**, which provides courses (free + paid) to help writers learn how to use AI effectively. [Future Fiction Academy](https://futurefictionacademy.com/courses/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    *   That means not just a tool, but a learning ecosystem — helpful if you’re still developing your prompt-engineering skills.
        
5.  **Project Export & Collaboration**  
    According to reviews, you can export documents to formats like DOCX, PDF, or plain text. [Marketing Tools](https://marketingtoolpro.com/2025/07/raptor-write-review/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
    Some real-time collaboration and sharing are supported. [Marketing Tools](https://marketingtoolpro.com/2025/07/raptor-write-review/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
6.  **Performance & UI**
    
    *   Minimalist, distraction-friendly interface. [Words@Scale+1](https://wordsatscale.com/raptorwrite-review/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    *   Hotkeys and other writing-focused UX features make it feel more like a “studio” than just a chat window. [Toolify](https://www.toolify.ai/ai-news/raptor-write-unleash-your-creativity-with-this-free-ai-writing-tool-3811105?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        

___________

Trade-Offs / Risks
------------------

1.  **Token Costs Can Add Up**  
    While the tool is free, generating a lot of content via paid LLMs through OpenRouter means recurring costs based on usage. [Toolify](https://www.toolify.ai/ai-news/raptor-write-unleash-your-creativity-with-this-free-ai-writing-tool-3811105?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
2.  **Browser-Based Storage**  
    Some critiques mention that project data (or at least parts of it) are stored in the browser, which can be risky or unwieldy for very large projects. [Toolify+1](https://www.toolify.ai/ai-news/raptor-write-unleash-your-creativity-with-this-free-ai-writing-tool-3811105?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
3.  **Limited Offline Functionality**  
    According to a review, editing capabilities are limited when you're offline; full functionality requires an internet connection. [Marketing Tools](https://marketingtoolpro.com/2025/07/raptor-write-review/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
4.  **No Built-in Grammar / Style Checker**  
    Unlike some premium tools that integrate grammar or style checking, Raptor Write seems more “AI generation + organization” rather than a full writing editor. [Marketing Tools](https://marketingtoolpro.com/2025/07/raptor-write-review/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
5.  **Interface & Organization Limitations**
    
    *   Some users say the interface can feel “clunky” compared to more polished paid tools. [The Writer Wannabe](https://writerwannabe.info/raptorwrite-analysis-does-it-elevates-the-modern-author?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    *   Fewer folder / nested-document features, unless you pay for the upgrade. [The Writer Wannabe](https://writerwannabe.info/raptorwrite-analysis-does-it-elevates-the-modern-author?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    *   From Reddit:
        
        > “It erases your settings if you refresh or close the window … your themes, models, prompts … are out the window … you have to start over again.” [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com//r/WritingWithAI/comments/1f7kobf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
6.  **Dependency on OpenRouter**  
    If OpenRouter’s pricing or policies change, that could materially affect how cheap or feasible it is for high-volume writing.
    

___________

When It’s a Smart Choice (Strategically)
----------------------------------------

*   If **budget is a key concern** and you want high-powered AI-assisted writing, this is a very competitive option.
    
*   For **creative writers** (fiction, worldbuilding, long-form), because of the document-based structure and support for “story bible”-style organization.
    
*   If you’re **learning AI-assisted writing**, since FFA provides structured courses and onboarding.
    
*   When you don’t need **very deep formatting or grammar-checking** features — or you’re okay pairing Raptor with another tool for final polish.
    

___________

When It Might Not Be Ideal
--------------------------

*   If you need a **fully offline writing app** or want to work without relying on browser storage.
    
*   When you’re doing **intensive collaborative writing** with many people and need more robust permissioning / version control.
    
*   If you’re producing **SEO-driven content or marketing copy** and want built-in SEO tools.
    
*   If you’re extremely cost-sensitive but also want to use very large LLMs non-stop: tokens could get expensive.
    

___________

### My Verdict (Strategic View)

Raptor Write Plus is _one of the best low-cost AI writing studios available right now_, especially for serious writers who want flexibility and a path into more advanced AI use — without being locked into a pricey subscription. The recent updates (as you mentioned) seem to solidify its value proposition: more organizational tools, better model management, performance tuning.

If I were you, as a productivity / writing strategist: I’d definitely test it, especially for experimental or creative writing. Pair it with a backup strategy (export often, save locally or in a more stable writing tool), and monitor your OpenRouter usage so costs don’t creep up unexpectedly.

___________

If you like, I can compare **Raptor Write Plus vs. other low-cost (or freemium) AI writing tools** (Sudowrite, NovelCrafter, etc.) as of 2025 — do you want me to do that?

## PROMPT 2

Yes.. compare to sudowrite, novelcrafter, plot drive, etc.. There's a new one called AI Story Hub..


The pricing structure seems all over the map.

Based on what you can find, give me an estimated cost of using these tools--- some include tokens and some require open router.. so try and get apples to apples here. Make an assumption on a monthly cost and what the average token consumption would be for a 50K word novel that probably takes many times that in planning, drafting, etc.

Do you have any questions before you begin?

## RESPONSE 2

Great — that’s exactly the kind of question that deserves a side-by-side analysis + some modeling. There _are_ a lot of moving parts (plans + token costs + usage patterns), so I’ll walk through assumptions, then estimate for a ~50K-word novel workflow (planning, drafting, iterating). Then I'll compare.

Here are a few assumptions I’m making, so you can confirm / adjust:

___________

Assumptions
-----------

1.  **Novel size & workflow**
    
    *   Final novel: ~50,000 words.
        
    *   But total “AI usage” (for planning, outlining, beats, first draft, revisions) is **much more** than those 50K — let’s assume ~3× overhead in “AI-prompt + AI-generated” tokens (so that includes planning + outlines + scene generation + revising).
        
    *   Roughly: planning = 10-15K words, scene drafts = 50K, revision expansions = another ~25-40K, etc.
        
2.  **Token-to-word conversion**
    
    *   Assume ~0.75 words per token (typical for GPT-ish models) when needed (this is model-dependent, but useful for estimates).
        
3.  **Model mix**
    
    *   For “open router / BYOK” style tools, assume a mix of mid / low-cost models. (Because a lot of writers using BYOK choose cheaper models for some tasks, more expensive ones for “final draft”).
        
    *   For fixed-credit tools (Sudowrite), we use their own abstraction of “credits” = “AI work”.
        
4.  **Monthly cadence**
    
    *   Assume the writer spreads the writing of the 50K novel + planning/revising over ~2-3 months of active AI-writing time. But to simplify: compute a “per month” cost under a steady usage assumption.
        

___________

Pricing & Token Cost for Each Tool
----------------------------------

Here’s a comparison of the tools you named: Sudowrite, NovelCrafter, Plotdrive, and **AI Story Hub**, plus how they might cost out under the scenario.

### 1\. **Sudowrite**

*   Plans & credits:
    
    *   Hobby & Student = **225,000 credits** / month for US$10 (annual) or $19 (monthly) [sudowrite.com+2Sudowrite | Documentation+2](https://sudowrite.com/pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    *   Professional = 1,000,000 credits / month for $29 (if paying monthly) [Sudowrite | Documentation](https://docs.sudowrite.com/plans--account/wBnmhtSyMcWtk2BLzifGkz/what-plans-are-available/mwfVvj2rGcKYs1BQy4Pdcb?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    *   Max = 2,000,000 credits / month for $59 (monthly) [sudowrite.com+1](https://sudowrite.com/pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
*   Credit usage: According to a review, ~1,000 words generation uses ~10,000–15,000 credits. [StorytellingDB](https://storytellingdb.com/sudowrite-review/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
    *   Let’s pick **12,000 credits / 1,000 words** as a working average.
        
    *   For 50,000 words, that’s ~600,000 credits (AI-generated).
        
    *   But add planning/revision overhead; if total AI-driven word-equivalent is ~120,000 words, that’s ~1.44 million credits.
        
*   Cost estimate:
    
    *   If you’re on the **Professional** plan (1M credits/month), 1.44M credits means ~1.5 months of full usage ⇒ cost ~1.5 × $29 = **~$43-45** (amortized).
        
    *   If you stayed monthly: this could be around **$43–50 / month** during your active writing months.
        
*   Pros / Caveats:
    
    *   Sudowrite’s credit system simplifies things — no BYOK.
        
    *   But credits can be used quickly depending on how “rich” your prompts are or which tool (Describe, Rewrite, etc.) you’re using. (Some users report burning through credits fast.) [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com//r/WritingWithAI/comments/1ihjo22?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    *   There’s less “pay-per-token” transparency; you're essentially locked into their credit model.

### 2\. **NovelCrafter (with OpenRouter / BYOK)**

*   Base subscription:
    
    *   Scribe: $4 / month (no AI) [novelcrafter](https://www.novelcrafter.com/pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    *   Hobbyist: $8 / month (AI with BYOK) [novelcrafter](https://www.novelcrafter.com/pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    *   Artisan: $14 / month (more features) [novelcrafter](https://www.novelcrafter.com/pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    *   Specialist: $20 / month for collaboration, etc. [novelcrafter](https://www.novelcrafter.com/pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
*   Token cost:
    
    *   According to their FAQ, using OpenRouter models has variable costs. [novelcrafter](https://www.novelcrafter.com/help/faq/ai-and-prompting/ai-cost?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    *   Example model costs (from their FAQ):
        
        *   Claude Opus: input $0.015 / 1k tokens, output $0.075 / 1k. [novelcrafter](https://www.novelcrafter.com/help/faq/ai-and-prompting/ai-cost?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
            
        *   GPT-4 turbo: input $0.01 / 1k, output $0.03 / 1k. [novelcrafter](https://www.novelcrafter.com/help/faq/ai-and-prompting/ai-cost?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
            
        *   Mid-cost: GPT-3.5-turbo: input $0.003, output $0.004 per 1k tokens. [novelcrafter](https://www.novelcrafter.com/help/faq/ai-and-prompting/ai-cost?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
            
        *   Low-cost: Claude 3 Haiku: $0.00025 / 1k input, $0.00125 / 1k output. [novelcrafter](https://www.novelcrafter.com/help/faq/ai-and-prompting/ai-cost?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
            
*   Estimating costs:  
    Let’s run two scenarios for token costs: **mid-cost** and **low-cost**.
    
    *   **Mid-cost (e.g., GPT-3.5 turbo)**
        
        *   Assume total token usage (input + output) = 3× your “word-equivalent” (because of planning + outlining + output).
            
        *   For 120,000 words equivalent → ~160,000 tokens (assuming 0.75 words/token) input + output. (This is rough.)
            
        *   Cost = 160,000 tokens / 1,000 \* (0.003 + 0.004) = 160 \* 0.007 = **$1.12** (very cheap).
            
        *   Add NovelCrafter sub: $8 (or $14 if you want the Artisan plan).
            
        *   Total ≈ **$9 – $15 / month** for heavy usage, if you stick to relatively cheap models.
            
    *   **Higher-cost (e.g., Claude Opus or GPT-4 turbo)**
        
        *   Using same token volume: 160k tokens →
            
            *   if GPT-4 turbo: cost = 160 \* (0.01 + 0.03) = $6.40
                
            *   plus NovelCrafter sub ($8–$14) → **~$15–$20+ / month**.
                
        *   If using very expensive model or very large context, costs scale.
            
*   Pros / Caveats:
    
    *   BYOK gives huge flexibility: you choose model + pay only for what you use.
        
    *   Risk: if you use _very expensive_ models heavily, costs could spike.
        
    *   But many users on Reddit report total spend (OpenRouter + NC) is **less than Sudowrite**, especially for planning and scene generation. [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1bu4e0k?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    *   Also, the “OpenRouter provider” matters — different underlying providers charge different rates. [Reddit+1](https://www.reddit.com//r/openrouter/comments/1mgz77y?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        

___________

### 3\. **Plotdrive**

*   Pricing:
    
    *   Free: 10 AI credits, 1 private project. [Plotdrive](https://docs.plotdrive.com/articles/115412-plans-and-pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    *   Creator: $19 / month → **50 AI credits** / month. [Plotdrive](https://docs.plotdrive.com/articles/115412-plans-and-pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    *   Pro: $39 / month → 200 credits / month. [Plotdrive](https://docs.plotdrive.com/articles/115412-plans-and-pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    *   Studio: $99 / month → 800 credits / month. [Plotdrive](https://docs.plotdrive.com/articles/115412-plans-and-pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
*   What a “credit” means: Plotdrive doesn’t clearly define “credit = X tokens / words” on their public pricing page. (“AI credits.”) That’s a limitation in transparency.
    
*   Estimate:
    
    *   If 50 AI credits = $19, how far does that go? Without concrete token equivalency, this is speculative, but you could think of 50 “credit units” as modest usage — likely good for planning, beats, maybe some prose, but not _heavy drafting_.
        
    *   For a 50K novel with a lot of AI generation, 200 credits (Pro) might be a more realistic minimum. That’s $39 / month.
        
    *   If you’re doing very heavy work, 800 credits ($99) gives more “room”.
        
*   Pros / Caveats:
    
    *   Very structured, collaborative writing studio — good for iterative planning + co-writing.
        
    *   But because “credit” isn’t transparently tied to tokens, predicting cost for large-scale generation is riskier.
        

___________

### 4\. **AI Story Hub**

*   Pricing:
    
    *   Free plan: $0, “unlimited platform access with core AI” per their pricing page. [AI Story Hub V2](https://app.aistoryhub.co/pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    *   Pro: $40 / month — unlocks their “human-like prose engine” + unlimited usage. [AI Story Hub V2](https://app.aistoryhub.co/pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
*   Cost behavior:
    
    *   Since Pro is “unlimited usage” in their marketing, you’re less exposed to per-token cost (at least from the user’s POV) — it behaves like a flat-rate plan.
        
    *   Risk: “unlimited” likely has practical fairness or throttling limits, or may be optimized for certain use cases. But for our purposes: $40 / month is your main cost.
        
*   Pros / Caveats:
    
    *   Very predictable cost, easier to budget.
        
    *   Less flexibility in swapping between cheap / expensive models (assuming their “core” vs “humanlike” is fixed).
        
    *   Good for writers who want to “write a lot” without micromanaging token costs.
        

___________

**Summary Comparison (Estimated Cost for a 50K-Word Novel + Overhead)**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

| Tool | Base / Subscription Cost | Estimated Monthly Cost for 50K Novel Workflow (with heavy AI use) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Sudowrite** | $19–$59 (depending plan) | **~US$ 43–50** during active months (on Professional plan) |
| **NovelCrafter + OpenRouter** | $8–$14 + token cost | **~US$ 9–20**, depending on model mix (mid or high cost) |
| **Plotdrive** | $19 / 50 credits → to $99 / 800 credits | **~US$ 39 minimum (Pro) to $99 (Studio)** for a realistic novel-heavy workflow |
| **AI Story Hub** | $0 or $40 Pro | **US$ 40** (for unlimited Pro usage) |

___________

Strategic Take-Aways
--------------------

*   **Cheapest-to-scale**: _NovelCrafter + OpenRouter_ is likely the most cost-efficient if you're savvy about which models you call, especially if you lean on cheaper models for planning and brainstorming, and maybe pay for “upgrade model” for final prose.
    
*   **Most predictable**: _AI Story Hub Pro_ gives a flat-rate, so you don’t need to worry about token accounting.
    
*   **Richest fiction toolset**: _Sudowrite_ has very mature writing tools (Story Bible, describe, rewrite, brainstorm) — good for authors who value the UI and built-in structure more than absolute cost.
    
*   **Team / structured writing**: _Plotdrive_ is good when you want shared projects, co-writing, or writing with accountability, but less optimized for raw output cost transparency.
    

___________

Risks & What to Watch Out For
-----------------------------

*   With **BYOK tools**, if you misestimate your token usage (or if you use expensive models heavily), monthly cost can balloon — you need to monitor OpenRouter / API usage actively.
    
*   With **credit-based tools**, you may find your credits don’t stretch as far during intense drafting phases, forcing plan upgrades or more usage.
    
*   “Unlimited” plans (like Story Hub) may have **fair-use limits**, or degrade performance / quality at scale — always test with your expected usage.
    

___________

If you like, I can run a **2025-current cost simulation** (using real-world OpenRouter model pricing) for a 50K novel (or whatever size you pick), to pick the _most cost-effective tool mix_. Do you want me to do that?

## PROMPT 3

Stack that against raptor write plus... and maybe the roll-your-own free tier chat bot experience that I'm currently staging in obsidian

## RESPONSE 3

Great — stacking Raptor Write Plus / your Obsidian-BYOK setup into the comparison gives a much clearer picture. (No big clarifying questions — I’ll just lay out the model, assumptions, and cost-comparison.)

___________

Key Assumptions (Adding Raptor + Obsidian setup)
------------------------------------------------

*   Same “50K novel + overhead” workflow as before (planning + drafting + revision).
    
*   For BYOK / OpenRouter tools (Raptor, your Obsidian staging), assume a mix of cheaper LLMs + occasional mid-tier model for key outputs.
    
*   Use token pricing from OpenRouter model rates via ai-pricing.info. [ai-pricing.info+1](https://ai-pricing.info/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
*   Assume you back up / export projects regularly, since Raptor’s storage is browser-based per reviews. [sudowrite.com+1](https://sudowrite.com/blog/sudowrite-vs-raptorwrite-which-ai-tool-respects-your-time-sanity-and-story/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

___________

**Raptor Write Plus**
---------------------

**Cost Structure:**

*   **Base cost:** Free to use. According to Raptor Write site, core version is no subscription. [raptorwrite.com](https://raptorwrite.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
*   **Upgrade cost:** ~US$ 79 one-time payment to unlock “Bring Your Own Keys” (i.e., connect your OpenRouter/OpenAI keys) + folder support. [The Writer Wannabe+2The Writer Wannabe+2](https://writerwannabe.info/raptorwrite-analysis-does-it-elevates-the-modern-author/amp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
*   **Token cost:** Depends entirely on which OpenRouter LLM you pick. (Raptor doesn’t absorb cost — you pay for inference via your API/key.)
    

**Token Pricing Examples via OpenRouter / ai-pricing.info:**

*   Mistral-7B-Instruct: ~$0.13 / 1k tokens (input) + $0.13 / 1k (output) per ai-pricing.info [ai-pricing.info+1](https://ai-pricing.info/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
*   Claude 3.5 Haiku: $0.25 (input) + $1.25 (output) per 1M tokens. [ai-pricing.info](https://ai-pricing.info/openrouter?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

**Estimated Monthly Cost for 50K Novel Workflow (similar assumptions to earlier):**

*   Suppose you generate **120,000 word-equivalent** of AI-driven planning/drafting/revising (as before).
    
*   Convert to tokens: ~160,000 tokens (if ~0.75 word/token).
    
*   If you use **Mistral 7B Instruct** (cheap-ish):
    
    *   Cost = 160,000 / 1,000 \* (0.13 + 0.13) = 160 \* 0.26 = **US$ 41.60**
        
*   If you use a more expensive model sometimes (e.g., Claude Haiku), cost goes up accordingly.
    
*   Plus the **one-time $79 upgrade**, but amortized: if you plan to use Raptor for many months, that breaks down.
    

**Risks / Trade-offs:**

*   You need to monitor your OpenRouter spend — Raptor doesn’t shield you from it.
    
*   Because Raptor saves to browser cache (unless you explicitly export), there's a risk of data loss. Reviews note you should manually back up. [sudowrite.com](https://sudowrite.com/blog/sudowrite-vs-raptorwrite-which-ai-tool-respects-your-time-sanity-and-story/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
*   More “DIY” — you're responsible for model choices, budgeting, and cost optimization.
    

**Strategic Value:**

*   Very cost-effective if you use cheaper models.
    
*   One-time fee gives a lot of flexibility without recurring subscription.
    
*   Good if you want strong organizational tools (documents, chapters) + control + low ongoing cost (assuming judicious model use).

**“Roll-Your-Own” Free-Tier Chat Bot in Obsidian**
--------------------------------------------------

You mention you’re staging a BYOB (bring-your-own-bot) experience in Obsidian. Assuming you're using Obsidian + some LLM via OpenRouter or an API:

*   **Subscription/Service Cost:** Likely minimal if Obsidian is just your interface (Obsidian itself doesn’t charge per LLM request).
    
*   **Token Cost:** As with Raptor, depends on which model you call via OpenRouter or other API.
    
    For instance, if you’re using **Mistral-7B** via OpenRouter (same as above): ~$0.13 + $0.13 per 1k tokens. [ai-pricing.info](https://ai-pricing.info/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
*   Estimated cost for the same 120,000-word-equivalent → **~US$ 41.60 / month** (if using Mistral).
    
*   If you occasionally use a higher-end model (for “big scene generates” or polishing), the monthly cost could go up.
    

**Risks / Trade-offs:**

*   You need to build more of the infrastructure / prompt templates yourself (in Obsidian).
    
*   No built-in “studio” features like Raptor / Sudowrite (unless you code them); but you gain flexibility and transparency.
    
*   Budgeting is more manual — you’ll need to track OpenRouter usage, likely using their usage-accounting API. [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/usage-accounting?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

___________

**Stacked Comparison (Including Raptor + Obsidian)**
----------------------------------------------------

Putting everything side by side with rough monthly cost for that 50K-novel scenario:

| Tool | Recurring/Fixed Cost | Estimated Monthly Cost for Novel Workflow + AI Work | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Sudowrite** | $29–59/month | ~US$ 43–50 | Predictable, but less flexible; credit-model simplifies thinking about “AI work” |
| **NovelCrafter + OpenRouter** | $8–14/month + BYOK cost | ~US$ 9–20 (depending on model) | Very cost-efficient if you pick cheap models + use smartly; more setup for api keys |
| **Plotdrive** | $39–99/month (depending on tier) | ~$39–99 | Structured for writing + collaboration, but less clear on credit/token equivalence |
| **AI Story Hub** | $40/month (Pro) | ~$40 (flat) | Most predictable; “unlimited” core use (but watch possible throttle / policy limits) |
| **Raptor Write Plus** | $0 base, $79 one-time upgrade for BYOK | ~US$ 41 (if using cheap LLM via OpenRouter) | High control, low long-term cost, but responsibility is on you; misc UI / storage trade-offs |
| **Obsidian + BYOK** | (just OpenRouter token cost) | ~US$ 41 (for cheap model scenario) | Maximum flexibility, minimal tooling cost, but you need to build more; tracking and cost management is manual |

___________

**Strategic Thoughts — Given This Comparison**
----------------------------------------------

1.  If **cost minimization** is your primary goal and you're comfortable managing OpenRouter keys + usage → Raptor Write Plus or Obsidian + BYOK are very strong plays.
    
2.  If you prefer **predictable billing** without thinking about tokens → AI Story Hub Pro is compelling.
    
3.  If you like a **studio + writing suite** (chapters, project organization, story bible) and are okay paying for credits or flat plan → NovelCrafter or Sudowrite is more ergonomic.
    
4.  For **collaborative / structured writing** (or ongoing multi-project work) → Plotdrive could make sense, though cost transparency is weaker.
    

___________

### **Risks / Things to Watch**

*   With BYOK setups: cost can spike if you accidentally call expensive models too often — monitor your OpenRouter usage.
    
*   OpenRouter caching: enabling prompt caching can lower cost, but it's model- and provider-specific. [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/docs/features/prompt-caching?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
*   Exporting: For Raptor (or Obsidian), make sure you back up your work regularly to avoid losing it.
    
*   Rate limits: OpenRouter’s free-tier has limits on requests / rate. [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/39501163636379-OpenRouter-Rate-Limits-What-You-Need-to-Know?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

___________

**Bottom line:** Raptor Write Plus + your Obsidian staging both offer very high value potential, _if you're okay managing the API / model side_. They may be some of the cheapest “serious” writing-studio-with-AI options when used smartly — but they lean more “power user” than “click-and-forget premium.”

If you like, I can run a **sensitivity analysis** (i.e. model-choice vs cost) for Raptor + Obsidian — so you pick a strategy that balances quality & spend. Do you want that?

## PROMPT 4

I'm using the Longform plugin in Obsidian to organize the draft and help with the pandoc-driven export. Github is backing up my vault so it's pretty solid.. but all the token inference stuff is done via copy/paste to a chatbot.. I grad a scene brief and linked context to story bible and use it as context to my LLM du jour..

Raptor write plus has a cloud storage option and the ability to manage prompts.. I'd have to backup often (probably to longform in Obsidian.

I also have Reedsy Editor that can handle the final publishing.


hmmm

## RESPONSE 4

That’s a really good breakdown — you have a solid, modular setup already. Here’s an analysis of your options (Raptor Write Plus vs continuing to lean on Obsidian + Longform + your copy/paste LLM workflow) — plus some trade-offs, and a suggested hybrid strategy.

___________

Analysis of Your Current Setup vs Raptor Write Plus
---------------------------------------------------

**Your Current Obsidian + Longform Workflow**

**Strengths:**

1.  **Robust Versioning / Backup**
    
    *   Using GitHub to back up your vault gives you solid version control and change history.
        
    *   Longform is built for long projects: its scene-based structure works well for organizing draft, index, compile. [GitHub](https://github.com/kevboh/longform?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    *   Because everything is plaintext (Markdown), it is very portable, and you can easily export via Pandoc for publishing.
        
2.  **Flexibility & Control in Prompting**
    
    *   By manually copying your scene brief + context + story bible into whatever LLM you’re using, you maintain _full control_ over prompt composition.
        
    *   You’re not locked into any “studio” UI or prompt template; you can tailor what you send to the model for each scene / beat.
        
3.  **Low Tool Lock-In**
    
    *   Obsidian + Longform is very future-proof: you own the files, and you can easily shift to another editor or publish via Pandoc / Git.
        
    *   You’re already working around the limitations of UI by building your own primed workflow, which is powerful.
        

**Risks / Trade-offs:**

*   **Friction Cost / Cognitive Load:** Copy/pasting context into a separate chatbot (LLM) is manual and incurs mental context switching.
    
*   **No Prompt Management:** Without a dedicated prompt management interface, it’s harder to reuse rich prompt templates, track “best” prompts, or systematically iterate prompts across scenes.
    
*   **Backup Risk for LLM-generated Content:** While your vault is backed up, the intermediate LLM work (e.g., generations in a separate chat UI) may not be automatically saved into your vault unless you paste everything in — which you seem to be doing, but it’s extra work.
    
*   **Export Complexity:** Using Pandoc is powerful, but it can be fiddly to get exactly how you want the final layout / styling.
    

___________

**Raptor Write Plus**

**Key Advantages Relative to Your Setup:**

1.  **Built-in Cloud Project Storage**
    
    *   Raptor Write Plus supports “F﻿FA Nexus” for cloud project storage. According to the Raptor Write UI, you can “upload” a JSON backup of your project––there’s an explicit “Upload Project Backup” option. [Raptor Write](https://raptorwrite.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    *   It also gives you some control over versioning / conflict resolution (“Force Overwrite”, “Cloud Save Only”) if you have multiple sessions. [Raptor Write](https://raptorwrite.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    *   This reduces risk of losing work if local browser storage is cleared, or if you switch devices.
        
2.  **Prompt Management + Modular Documents**
    
    *   Raptor lets you split your project into modular “documents” / scenes inside the studio. [Raptor Write](https://raptorwrite.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    *   You can save and load sets of prompts. In the UI you can “Save Prompt Set” and recall it later. [Raptor Write](https://raptorwrite.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    *   This gives more structure / reusability for your prompt templates than doing copy-paste into a chatbot.
        
3.  **OpenRouter / BYOK Support**
    
    *   You can wire Raptor to your own OpenRouter key / provider. [Raptor Write](https://raptorwrite.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    *   That means you maintain cost control and flexibility in model choice (similar to your current workflow) but inside a more polished writing environment.
        
4.  **Export Flexibility**
    
    *   Raptor supports exporting documents in `.md`, `.txt`, `.doc` formats right from the UI. [Raptor Write](https://raptorwrite.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    *   This makes it relatively easy to sync back into your Obsidian vault (or drop into Longform, or run through Pandoc for final publishing).
        

**Trade-offs / Risks:**

*   **One More Tool in the Chain:** Introducing Raptor adds another place to manage project state, which means you’ll need to decide how to sync / backup between Raptor and Obsidian (which you already flagged — backing up from Raptor into Obsidian is wise).
    
*   **Manual Backup Still Needed:** Even though there’s cloud save, best practice would be to regularly export / backup (e.g., when switching devices, before major changes) — “upload backup” is explicitly supported. [Raptor Write](https://raptorwrite.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
*   **Browser-based Risks:** Since Raptor is browser-based, losing a session or clearing storage without syncing could still be dangerous if you don’t use cloud saves.
    
*   **Learning Curve:** You’ll need to recreate or rework your prompt templates in Raptor, which is upfront work.
    

___________

**Recommended Hybrid Strategy**
-------------------------------

Given your existing strengths and the trade-offs, here’s a hybrid strategy that might give you the best of both worlds:

1.  **Use Raptor Write Plus for “LLM-Driven Draft / Planning”**
    
    *   Use Raptor for generating scenes, doing prompt-heavy work, iterating drafts.
        
    *   Create scene-level documents in Raptor that correspond to your Longform scenes in Obsidian → this makes it easier to align drafts between the two.
        
    *   Regularly export Raptor documents (md or doc) and paste them back into your Obsidian vault (or drop them into Longform scenes) so your canonical draft lives in Git-backed Obsidian.
        
2.  **Keep Obsidian + Longform as Your “Master Vault”**
    
    *   Continue using Longform for structuring scenes, tracking “scene brief → draft → revision” within Obsidian.
        
    *   Use your Git backup to keep your Obsidian project safe, including LLM-generated content that you’ve imported.
        
    *   Use Pandoc / your existing export process (or Reedsy Editor) for final drafting / typesetting / publishing.
        
3.  **Prompt Template Management**
    
    *   Build your prompt templates in Raptor Write (leveraging its prompt set feature).
        
    *   When you find a “combo” of prompt + scene content that works really well, export it (from Raptor) back to a note in Obsidian → version control and iterate.
        
    *   This gives you a kind of bridge: Raptor as “LLM playground / working draft”, Obsidian as “source of truth + long-term storage + export.”
        
4.  **Backup Discipline**
    
    *   Make it a habit: before big sessions in Raptor, do a “Cloud Save” + export to JSON.
        
    *   At the end of a writing day (or week), sync Raptor’s latest into Obsidian.
        
    *   Maintain Git commits regularly so you have a full history of your vault, including inserted LLM text.
        

___________

**My Take**
-----------

*   Yes, **Raptor Write Plus** seems like a very smart addition to your workflow — it gives you structure, prompt management, and a more “studio-like” environment without sacrificing your BYOK / OpenRouter flexibility.
    
*   But you don’t need to fully abandon your Obsidian + Longform + Git-based workflow. In fact, combining them is powerful: Obsidian remains your long-term, highly controllable writing environment; Raptor becomes the place where you rapidly prototype, generate, and refine with LLM.
    
*   The key risk is sync / data loss — but with disciplined backups / exports, you can mitigate that.
    

___________

If you like, I can **map out exactly how to sync Raptor Write + Obsidian + Longform** (specific folder structure, naming conventions, export frequency), based on how authors in the community do it. Do you want me to build that?
