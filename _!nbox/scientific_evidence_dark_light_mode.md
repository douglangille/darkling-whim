# Scientific Evidence: Dark vs Light Mode

## Cognitive Performance

### Light Mode Advantages
- **Higher cognitive performance scores** across all demographics
- **14ms faster judgment times** due to pupil constriction
- Better visual acuity for text reading
- Lower cognitive workload for sustained focus
- **Sources:** PMC 2024-2025, Ergonomics journals

### Dark Mode Characteristics
- Increased pupil dilation = higher cognitive workload
- Brain works harder even when accuracy improves
- Better for low-light environments only
- 78% of developers report reduced eye strain in evening sessions
- **Trade-off:** Comfort vs. performance

## Eye Strain & Visual Fatigue

### Key Finding: No Significant Overall Difference
- Meta-analysis: No significant difference in general visual fatigue between modes
- **BUT specific metrics differ:**

### Dry Eyes (Significantly Different)
- **Light mode worse** for dry eyes
- Mechanism: Higher brightness → more light entering eye → faster tear evaporation
- Solution: Brightness management (40-50%) + ambient lighting, not mode switching

### Critical Flicker Frequency
- **Light mode better** (indicates less visual fatigue)
- Dark mode shows trend toward higher perceived strain in bright environments

### Context: Ambient Lighting is Critical
- **Bright environments:** Light mode significantly outperforms
- **Dim environments:** Dark mode acceptable but light mode still better for small text
- **Halation effect:** Dark mode creates blur around text for some vision types

## Battery Life (OLED vs LCD)

### OLED Displays (iPhone 13)
- **Realistic savings:** 3-9% at typical brightness (30-50%)
- **Maximum savings:** 39-47% at 100% brightness (sunny outdoor use)
- **Conclusion:** Marginal benefit doesn't justify clarity trade-off for most use cases

### LCD Displays (iPad mini 6, MacBook displays)
- **Zero to negligible savings** from dark mode
- LCD backlights illuminate entire screen regardless of pixel color
- **Conclusion:** Battery irrelevant for mode decision on LCD devices

## ADHD & Neurodiversity

### Light Sensitivity Statistics
- **69% of people with ADHD** report light oversensitivity
- Compare to **28% without ADHD**
- Linked to dopamine and melatonin production regulation in eyes

### Consistency & Cognitive Load
- ADHD brains rely on external structure to offload working memory
- **Visual inconsistency creates decision-making overhead**
- Solution: Intentional context-dependent rules (not uniformity)
- **Visual rhythm zones** reduce cognitive load more effectively than single mode

### Environmental Design
- Warm lighting (2700K) more effective than dark mode alone
- Predictable environments reduce sensory overload
- Fluorescent lights particularly problematic for ADHD sensory issues

## Circadian Rhythm & Sleep

### Blue Light Effects
- Short wavelength (blue) light suppresses melatonin production
- **Timing matters more than intensity** for circadian effects
- Evening blue light exposure delays sleep onset

### Night Shift Effectiveness
- Default 4100K balances melatonin management with text readability
- Helps but doesn't eliminate sleep impact
- **Warm environment lighting** (desk lamp) more effective than screen mode alone

### Pre-Sleep Recommendations
- Reduce screen use 1-2 hours before sleep
- Use warm lighting (2700K) + reduced brightness
- Dark mode optional but not sufficient alone

## Icon Customization Impact (iOS/iPadOS 18.2)

### Full-Color Icons
- **Fastest recognition** (color cues activate quick pattern matching)
- Higher visual stimulation and cognitive load
- Best for functional, speed-focused devices

### Tinted Icons (Monochrome)
- **Moderate recognition speed** (shape-based vs. color-based)
- Reduces cognitive load by removing color competition
- Proven to reduce phone addiction (less dopamine trigger from colors)

### Clear Icons (Translucent Glass)
- **Slowest recognition** (most abstract)
- **Lowest cognitive load** (minimal visual noise)
- Best for consumption-focused devices where speed less critical

## Reading & Text Comprehension

### Light Mode Advantages
- Better contrast for sustained reading (black text on white background)
- Pupils constrict → sharper focus on text
- Higher reading speed and comprehension in controlled lighting

### Dark Mode Considerations
- Can cause halation effect (text appears to bleed/blur)
- Small text particularly problematic in dark mode
- Better for scanning vs. deep reading

## Brightness Management

### Auto Brightness Benefits
- Matches screen to ambient light automatically
- Reduces eye strain more effectively than manual adjustment
- Prevents excessive brightness in dark environments
- Eliminates decision fatigue (one less ADHD friction point)

### Manual Adjustment Guidelines
- **Office/bright indoor:** 40-50% brightness
- **Evening/dim indoor:** 30-40% brightness
- **Pre-sleep:** 30% maximum
- **Outdoor/sunny:** Let auto brightness handle (or manual 70-90%)

### Reduce White Point
- Lowers maximum intensity of white/bright colors
- Different from brightness (affects color intensity, not backlight)
- Useful for nighttime use when even dark mode feels too bright
- Recommended as toggle (triple-click accessibility shortcut)

## 20-20-20 Rule (Evidence-Based)
- **Every 20 minutes:** Look away from screen
- **For 20 seconds:** Give eyes accommodation break
- **At 20 feet distance:** Reduces eye muscle fatigue
- More effective than mode switching for preventing eye strain

## Key Takeaways

✅ **Light mode objectively better** for cognitive performance and clarity
✅ **Dark mode acceptable** in low-light environments for comfort
✅ **Battery savings marginal** on OLED, zero on LCD
✅ **ADHD benefits** from intentional context-dependent rules, not uniformity
✅ **Brightness management** more important than mode choice
✅ **Night Shift + warm lighting** better than dark mode alone for sleep
✅ **Icon customization** should match device purpose (speed vs. calm)
