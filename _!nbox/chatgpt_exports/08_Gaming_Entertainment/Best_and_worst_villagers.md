Acnh best and worst villagers

---

**Assistant:**

“Best” and “worst” Animal Crossing: New Horizons villagers are pretty subjective—people rank them based on cuteness, personality, design, or meme status. But there are some community patterns:  

---

### Widely Loved (Best)
- **Raymond** (smug cat) – office look, heterochromia, huge fanbase.  
- **Marshal** (smug squirrel) – stylish, popular since New Leaf.  
- **Judy** (snooty cub) – pastel bear cub with starry eyes.  
- **Ankha** (snooty cat) – Egyptian theme, iconic dances/memes.  
- **Fauna** (normal deer) – sweet, approachable, “perfect neighbor” vibes.  
- **Stitches** (lazy cub) – patchwork teddy bear design.  
- **Lucky** (lazy dog) – wrapped like a mummy, darkly cute.  
- **Diana** (snooty deer) – elegant, calm, refined.  

---

### Widely Disliked (Worst)
- **Truffles** (peppy pig) – often cited for awkward design.  
- **Barold** (lazy cub) – sloppy shirt, creepy basement setups.  
- **Beardo** (smug bear) – unsettling mutton chops, “bathroom wallpaper” house.  
- **Rocket** (uchi gorilla) – pink superhero aesthetic, divisive.  
- **Jambette** (normal frog) – large lips, jarring look to some.  
- **Moose** (jock mouse) – off-putting face and eyebrows.  
- **Pietro** (smug sheep) – clown design: loved by some, hated by many.  
- **Chops** (smug pig) – “wannabe aristocrat” look, often ranked bottom.  

---

### Key Point
- “Best” = cute, stylish, unique designs that fit fan headcanon.  
- “Worst” = off-putting designs, awkward facial features, or houses with strange décor.  
- Fandom taste shifts over time—villagers like Pietro or Barold even have ironic fanbases.  

Do you want me to break this down **by personality type** (jock, lazy, snooty, etc.) so you get a sense of which villagers shine or flop in each category?

**User:**

Kyle

---

**Assistant:**

Kyle is a **smug wolf** introduced in *New Leaf* who also appears in *New Horizons*.  

### Traits
- **Species/Personality**: Wolf / Smug  
- **Catchphrase**: “alpha”  
- **Appearance**: Golden-yellow fur, dark eye markings, rock-star style jacket.  
- **House (NH)**: Music-themed with instruments and speakers—fits his “rocker” vibe.  
- **Hobby**: Music  

### Reputation
- **Fan perception**:  
  - Generally well-liked—considered one of the “cooler” smug villagers.  
  - His look feels intentional (rock star vs. just random clothing).  
  - Some players love his house theme for band setups.  
- **In rankings**: Usually middle-high tier, not cult-icon like Raymond or Marshal, but far from disliked.  
- **Quirks**: Smug villagers can come across as flirtatious or self-absorbed, but Kyle’s design makes it charming instead of grating.  

### Bottom Line
Kyle isn’t “best of the best” popularity-wise, but he’s one of the stronger smug villagers—cool design, fitting personality, and a house that actually works. He’s a safe win if you like stylish or music-themed villagers.  

Want me to compare **Kyle against other smug wolves** (like Chief, Lobo, Wolfgang) to see how he stacks up within his species?

**User:**

Best peppy

---

**Assistant:**

The **best peppy villagers** are usually judged on cuteness, personality balance (since peppies can be *a lot*), and house design. A few standouts in *New Horizons*:  

---

### Top-Tier Peppy Villagers
- **Audie (wolf)**  
  - Bright orange wolf inspired by a famous grandma who logged 3,500+ hours in *New Leaf*.  
  - Sunny design, tropical house, instantly became a fan favorite.  

- **Rosie (cat)**  
  - The OG peppy—bright blue with a cheerful plaid dress.  
  - Been in the series since the start, often seen as *the* iconic peppy villager.  

- **Tangy (cat)**  
  - Orange with a leaf stem head—literally a citrus cat.  
  - Quirky food design + cheerful vibe = long-term fan favorite.  

- **Cherry (dog)** *(note: she’s actually Uchi, not Peppy—often mistaken)*  

- **Poppy (squirrel)** *(actually Normal, not Peppy—mislisted sometimes)*  

- **Chrissy & Francine (rabbits)**  
  - Polka-dot pop idols, often considered as a duo.  
  - Loud, flashy, but beloved by many for their matching theme.  

- **Bluebear (cub)**  
  - Tiny, bright teal bear cub.  
  - Simple, adorable design; one of the “comfort villagers.”  

- **Bunnie (rabbit)**  
  - Classic, cheerful look; she’s one of the friendliest and most balanced peppies.  

---

### Why They Work
- **Audie, Rosie, Tangy, Bunnie, Bluebear** = “cute but not overwhelming.”  
- **Chrissy & Francine** = polarizing, but if you like glam idols, they’re top-tier.  

---

Do you want me to also give you the **worst peppy villagers** (the ones players usually try to move out), so you’ve got the full best–worst contrast?

---

**User:**

Best cranky

---

**Assistant:**

For **cranky villagers**, the “best” usually means they pull off the grumpy-old-man vibe without being off-putting, and their design feels intentional rather than sloppy. A few standouts in *New Horizons*:  

---

### Top-Tier Cranky Villagers  
- **Wolfgang (wolf)**  
  - Classic cranky wolf, sharp design, fits the archetype perfectly.  
  - His house in NH has a sleek, modern vibe.  
  - A fan favorite since *Wild World*.  

- **Chief (wolf)**  
  - Orange wolf with a weathered, rugged look.  
  - Feels like a “wise uncle” character more than just cranky.  

- **Fang (wolf)**  
  - White wolf with purple eyelids, cool and composed.  
  - Elegant design; often compared to Diana (snooty deer) as his female counterpart.  

- **Apollo (eagle)**  
  - Black-and-white eagle, patriotic in earlier games, now more subdued.  
  - House has a “rocker” feel; often considered one of the most iconic crankies.  

- **Octavian (octopus)**  
  - Only cranky octopus; red with sucker marks.  
  - His house is space-themed, which gives him a cult following.  

- **Butch (dog)**  
  - Beagle-like with a solid, grounded design.  
  - Less flashy, more “neighborly old guy” cranky.  

- **Rocco (hippo)**  
  - Not universally loved, but has a fanbase for his “grumpy but soft inside” energy.  

---

### Why These Work  
- **Wolves** dominate: Wolfgang, Chief, Fang—each nails the cranky archetype but in distinct flavors (cool, rugged, elegant).  
- **Apollo** and **Octavian** stand out for species uniqueness and iconic status.  
- **Butch** offers a more grounded, less stylized option if you want cranky without drama.  

---

Do you want me to flip it and also cover the **worst crankies** (the ones who get flak for weird designs or off-putting houses), to round out the picture?

---

**User:**

Worst cranky

---

**Assistant:**

The **worst cranky villagers** usually end up on that list because of awkward designs, off-putting houses, or just not fitting the “grumpy old man with charm” archetype. In *New Horizons*, a few come up again and again:  

---

### Bottom-Tier Cranky Villagers  
- **Cyrano (anteater)**  
  - Bright blue with orange nose, odd proportions.  
  - His house feels dated, not in a good cranky way—just dull.  

- **Rizzo (mouse)**  
  - Rat-like mouse with tiny eyes and samurai armor house.  
  - Polarizing; many find him creepy rather than endearingly cranky.  

- **Camofrog (frog)**  
  - Green camo skin pattern—divisive design.  
  - Some love the military vibe, but many rank him low.  

- **Knox (chicken)**  
  - Medieval knight aesthetic, cranky personality.  
  - Very niche appeal; feels gimmicky more than authentic cranky.  

- **Monty (monkey)**  
  - Grumpy expression nailed down, but his design feels flat compared to wolves or eagles.  
  - Often overlooked or forgotten.  

- **Angus (bull)**  
  - Horned bull with cranky personality, but doesn’t lean into it—he reads more “bland tough guy.”  

---

### Why They Rank Low  
- **Cyrano, Monty, Angus** → bland or unremarkable designs.  
- **Rizzo, Camofrog, Knox** → too extreme or off-putting; design overshadows personality.  

---

So: cranky wolves and Apollo are almost universally loved, but when you get into anteaters, mice, and monkeys, the design quality drops fast.  

Want me to make you a **species-by-species quick list** of who’s the best and worst cranky in each group (wolves, eagles, anteaters, etc.)? That would give you a clean map of who to keep and who to avoid.

---

**User:**

Vic and Walt?

---

**Assistant:**

Got it — let’s look at **Vic** and **Walt**, both crankies but very different flavors.  

---

### **Vic (cranky bull)**  
- **Design**: Viking-inspired, horned helmet, shaggy look.  
- **House (NH)**: Wooden longhouse vibe, fits his Norse aesthetic.  
- **Fan perception**:  
  - Mixed leaning negative. Some find the Viking theme fun, others think it’s too gimmicky and clunky.  
  - His bulky design doesn’t have the charm that cranky wolves or Apollo bring.  
- **Tier**: Lower-mid. He’s not as disliked as Rizzo or Cyrano, but nowhere near top-tier.  

---

### **Walt (cranky kangaroo)**  
- **Design**: Grey kangaroo with a scar over his eye; his joey also has the scar.  
- **House (NH)**: Traditional Japanese tatami interior — sliding doors, bamboo, very clean aesthetic.  
- **Fan perception**:  
  - Generally positive — one of the stronger kangaroo designs.  
  - The scar gives him “tough old mentor” vibes, which pairs well with cranky personality.  
  - His house is a favorite among players who like Japanese-themed builds.  
- **Tier**: Upper-mid. Not iconic, but respected as one of the best cranky kangaroos and better executed than most cranky oddballs.  

---

### Bottom Line  
- **Vic** = thematic but clunky, middling popularity.  
- **Walt** = quietly one of the better crankies outside the wolf/eagle club; he nails the archetype without being off-putting.  

Do you want me to slot **Vic and Walt** into the **overall cranky tier list** (S through F) so you can see where they land compared to Wolfgang, Apollo, Rizzo, etc.?

---

**User:**

Audie

---

**Assistant:**

**Audie** is one of the most beloved **peppy villagers** in *Animal Crossing: New Horizons*.  

---

### Core Details
- **Species/Personality**: Wolf / Peppy  
- **Catchphrase**: “foxtrot”  
- **Design**: Bright orange fur, turquoise sunglasses perched on her head, tropical vibe.  
- **House (NH)**: Beach-resort theme — surfboard, rattan furniture, colorful wallpaper.  
- **Hobby**: Fitness  

---

### Reputation
- **Origin story**: Named after a real grandma, Audie, who logged 3,500+ hours in *New Leaf*. Nintendo immortalized her as this wolf — which endeared her to the fandom instantly.  
- **Fan perception**:  
  - Warm reception: she’s cheerful without being grating, and her tropical aesthetic is a natural fit for island life.  
  - She quickly became *the* breakout villager of NH’s new additions.  
  - Often ranked as the **top peppy wolf** (over Freya or Skye, who are snooty/normal).  
- **Tier**: Consistently top-tier. Not quite the cult obsession of Raymond or Marshal, but in the same popularity bracket as Fauna, Ankha, and Judy.  

---

### Bottom Line
Audie is widely seen as one of the **best peppy villagers overall** and probably the most iconic of the new NH villagers. She’s bright, fun, and has a touching real-world backstory.  

Do you want me to contrast **Audie against Rosie and Tangy**—the other long-standing “queen bees” of the peppy personality—to see how she stacks up?

**User:**

Best smug

---

**Assistant:**

Among the **smug villagers**, a few consistently rise to the top because they balance charm, design, and personality quirks without feeling overbearing.  

---

### Top Smug Villagers in *New Horizons*  

- **Raymond (cat)**  
  - The office cat with heterochromia.  
  - Cult icon, top-tier meme status.  
  - Polarizing (some say overhyped), but still the #1 smug by popularity.  

- **Marshal (squirrel)**  
  - Tiny cream squirrel with a perma-smirk.  
  - Popular since *New Leaf*, often seen as the “cool kid” smug.  
  - His simple but stylish design ages well.  

- **Julian (unicorn)**  
  - Sparkly blue unicorn with a starry house.  
  - Unique species + fantasy design makes him unforgettable.  

- **Kyle (wolf)**  
  - Rock star aesthetic; yellow fur with black markings.  
  - His house doubles as a music studio.  
  - Very “cool uncle” vibe, less hyped than Raymond but respected.  

- **Lopez (antelope)**  
  - Stylish, deer-gazelle hybrid with a modern house.  
  - Sleek design makes him one of the strongest smug deer.  

- **Zell (deer)**  
  - Black-and-white tuxedo deer.  
  - Understated but fashionable; fits the suave smug archetype perfectly.  

---

### Why They Work
- **Raymond/Marshal** = internet fame + great designs.  
- **Julian** = fantasy appeal, one-of-a-kind species.  
- **Kyle/Zell/Lopez** = stylish, grounded “cool” options that don’t wear thin.  

---

👉 If you want just **one smug villager who feels timeless**, most players pick **Marshal** (cute + smug balance) or **Zell** (suave + not overexposed).  

Do you want me to also lay out the **worst smug villagers** (the ones players usually try to avoid) so you’ve got the contrast?

---

**User:**

Tabby

---

**Assistant:**

**Tabby** is a **peppy cat** who often lands near the bottom of popularity polls.  

---

### Core Details  
- **Species/Personality**: Cat / Peppy  
- **Catchphrase**: “me-WOW”  
- **Appearance**: Orange tabby with wide, toothy grin, yellow eyes, and striped face markings.  
- **House (NH)**: Karaoke-style setup with neon wallpaper and a mic stand — matches her “outgoing pop star” persona.  
- **Hobby**: Music  

---

### Reputation  
- **Fan perception**:  
  - Frequently ranked among the *worst-looking cats*. Her grin and facial markings come off as unsettling rather than cute.  
  - Some players think she looks like a human in face paint, which doesn’t help.  
  - That said, a small group of fans like her because she’s “so bad she’s good” and her karaoke room fits the peppy theme perfectly.  
- **Tier**: Usually *D or F tier* in community lists, alongside Jambette and Rizzo.  

---

### Bottom Line  
Tabby is a true **love-her-or-hate-her villager**: most avoid her for her design, but a few cherish her quirky, over-the-top personality and her unapologetically bold look.  

Want me to put Tabby in the **context of all cat villagers** (best → worst), so you can see where she sits compared to Rosie, Raymond, Ankha, etc.?

---

**User:**

Tybalt 

---

**Assistant:**

**Tybalt** is a **jock tiger** who’s generally middle-of-the-pack in fan rankings.  

---

### Core Details  
- **Species/Personality**: Tiger / Jock  
- **Catchphrase**: “grrrRAH”  
- **Appearance**: Orange-and-black striped tiger with a bold, slightly goofy grin.  
- **House (NH)**: Simple workout-themed interior — punching bag, weights, protein shakes.  
- **Hobby**: Fitness (as with most jocks)  

---

### Reputation  
- **Fan perception**:  
  - Not hated, but not loved. His look is serviceable but less memorable than tigers like Bangle (snooty) or Rolf (cranky).  
  - Personality-wise, he’s very on-brand jock: talks a lot about muscles, protein, and exercise.  
  - Some players find him generic compared to flashier tigers (Leonardo, Rowan).  
- **Tier**: Usually *C-tier*. He’s fine if you like tigers or want a jock, but he won’t be a standout.  

---

### Bottom Line  
Tybalt is a **solid but forgettable jock villager**: no big fanbase, no big hatebase. If you want a tiger for muscle energy, he’ll do the job — but he’s not iconic.  

Want me to give you a **“best and worst jocks” short list** so you can see where Tybalt stacks up against the others?

**User:**

S and A tiers

---

**Assistant:**

Got it — here’s a **fan-consensus S and A tier snapshot** of *Animal Crossing: New Horizons* villagers, across personalities. This pulls from recurring community tier lists (Reddit, Nookazon, YouTube polls).  

---

## 🟣 **S-Tier (the icons)**  
The ones nearly everyone agrees are top of the top:  

- **Raymond (smug cat)** – office cat with heterochromia, internet meme legend.  
- **Marshal (smug squirrel)** – tiny cream squirrel with a permanent smirk.  
- **Judy (snooty cub)** – pastel rainbow cub with starry eyes.  
- **Ankha (snooty cat)** – Egyptian cat, iconic design and meme status.  
- **Fauna (normal deer)** – sweet, approachable, “perfect neighbor.”  
- **Stitches (lazy cub)** – patchwork teddy bear, unique and adorable.  
- **Lucky (lazy dog)** – mummy dog, creepy-cute cult favorite.  
- **Audie (peppy wolf)** – tropical wolf, named after the grandma who played 3,500+ hours.  

---

## 🔵 **A-Tier (strong favorites, not quite cult status)**  
Popular, stylish, or well-loved in niches:  

- **Diana (snooty deer)** – elegant, refined, purple-eyed deer.  
- **Fang (cranky wolf)** – cool white wolf, calm and composed.  
- **Chief (cranky wolf)** – rugged, orange wolf, “wise uncle” vibes.  
- **Wolfgang (cranky wolf)** – classic wolf, iconic grump.  
- **Apollo (cranky eagle)** – patriotic eagle, one of the series mascots.  
- **Julian (smug unicorn)** – sparkly blue unicorn with starry home.  
- **Kyle (smug wolf)** – rock-star wolf with music room.  
- **Zell (smug deer)** – tuxedo-styled deer, understated but classy.  
- **Tangy (peppy cat)** – citrus fruit cat, quirky but beloved.  
- **Rosie (peppy cat)** – the original peppy, cheerful blue cat.  
- **Bluebear (peppy cub)** – teal cub, simple and cute.  
- **Bunnie (peppy rabbit)** – cheerful and balanced, long-time fan favorite.  
- **Octavian (cranky octopus)** – unique red octopus with space-themed home.  

---

### Key Pattern  
- **Cats, wolves, and deer dominate the top ranks.**  
- **Smugs** split between S (Raymond/Marshal) and A (Kyle/Zell/Julian).  
- **Crankies** are almost all wolves/eagles/octopus — anteaters, mice, and bulls sink lower.  
- **Peppies**: Audie, Rosie, Tangy, Bluebear, Bunnie hold strong; Tabby and Truffles are way down.  

---

Do you want me to build you a **full personality-by-personality S and A tier chart** (Smug, Cranky, Peppy, Normal, etc.) so you can scan favorites at a glance?

---

**User:**

Bud

---

**Assistant:**

**Bud** is a **jock lion** who sits in the “forgettable but not hated” zone.  

---

### Core Details  
- **Species/Personality**: Lion / Jock  
- **Catchphrase**: “shredded”  
- **Appearance**: Tan lion with a surfer/dude aesthetic — blond mane, round shades.  
- **House (NH)**: Beachy surf shack with bamboo furniture and a surfboard.  
- **Hobby**: Fitness  

---

### Reputation  
- **Fan perception**:  
  - Compared to the other lions (Rory, Rex, Mott), Bud is one of the better-designed. His chill, beach-bro vibe makes him less intense than most jocks.  
  - Still, lions as a whole aren’t a top species — they’re bulky and underloved compared to wolves, cats, and deer.  
  - Bud sometimes gets a small cult following as the “laid-back gym bro who surfs.”  
- **Tier**: C+ to B-. Not iconic, but not disliked. Solid middle.  

---

### Bottom Line  
Bud is a **mid-tier jock**: if you want a lion on your island, he’s one of the better ones. But as a jock overall, he doesn’t stack up against favorites like Genji (rabbit), Bam (deer), or Ribbot (robot frog).  

Want me to give you a **best vs. worst lions list** so you can see where Bud sits in his own species?

---

**User:**

Pinky

---

**Assistant:**

**Pinky** is a **peppy bear** with a very bold design that splits opinion.  

---

### Core Details  
- **Species/Personality**: Bear / Peppy  
- **Catchphrase**: “cubbie”  
- **Appearance**: Bright pink fur, panda-inspired markings, starry eyeshadow.  
- **House (NH)**: Very pink, festival-style interior — paper lanterns, pagoda wallpaper.  
- **Hobby**: Fashion  

---

### Reputation  
- **Fan perception**:  
  - **Divisive.** Some players love her loud, panda-inspired look and see her as cheerful and unique.  
  - Others find her design garish or “too much” — she often lands in lower tiers for aesthetics.  
  - Being a peppy bear also works against her; players usually prefer peppies in smaller, “cuter” species (cats, cubs, rabbits).  
- **Tier**: Usually C–D. Not outright hated like Jambette or Truffles, but rarely a first choice.  

---

### Bottom Line  
Pinky is a **love-it-or-leave-it villager**: quirky panda design with a lot of personality, but not conventionally cute. She appeals most if you like bold color palettes and larger villagers.  

Want me to rank **all the peppy bears/cubs** (Bluebear, Judy, Pinky, etc.) so you can see where Pinky fits within her personality + species niche?

**User:**

Oranges not native to island. Sell or make something to sell

---

**Assistant:**

Non-native fruit (like your **oranges**) is one of the best steady money sources in *ACNH*. Here’s how to play it smart:  

---

### Raw Selling Value  
- **Native fruit**: 100 Bells each.  
- **Non-native fruit**: 500 Bells each.  
- **Perfect fruit** (*not in NH, only NL*) — so no bonus here.  

So: selling oranges straight = **500 Bells per piece / 3,000 Bells per tree harvest**.  

---

### Crafting Route (if you want to squeeze more)  
- Most fruit recipes don’t massively outpace raw sale value — but some are worth it:  
  - **Orange end table / orange clock / orange wall items** sell for **1,600–2,200 Bells** (using 10 oranges = ~1,600 Bells raw vs. crafted).  
  - Crafting usually isn’t better for profit; it’s more for decorating.  

---

### Best Bell Strategy  
1. **Plant a full orchard** of your non-native fruit. (20–30 trees = consistent 60k–90k Bells per 3 days.)  
2. **Sell raw** to Nook’s Cranny.  
3. **Optional:** save some for trading online or with friends — non-native fruit can be swapped to diversify.  

---

### Bottom Line  
In *New Horizons*, **sell the oranges raw**. Crafting with them is fun for décor, but Bells-per-fruit is higher if you skip recipes.  

Want me to give you a **top 3 money-making loops** beyond fruit (turnips, hot items, tarantulas/scorpions) so you can see where oranges rank in the bigger picture?

---

**User:**

Megan

---

**Assistant:**

**Megan** is a **normal bear** and was one of the new villagers introduced in *Animal Crossing: New Horizons*.  

---

### Core Details  
- **Species/Personality**: Bear / Normal  
- **Catchphrase**: “sundae”  
- **Appearance**: Pastel purple bear with teal-tipped ears and gentle features.  
- **House (NH)**: Cozy, cottagecore vibe with floral wallpaper, wooden furniture, and a very “storybook” aesthetic.  
- **Hobby**: Nature  

---

### Reputation  
- **Fan perception**:  
  - Generally positive. She’s seen as sweet, soft, and comforting, fitting the “normal” personality well.  
  - Compared to other big bears (who often skew goofy or loud, like Pinky or Chow), Megan feels softer and more approachable.  
  - Doesn’t hit the popularity of Fauna, Maple, or Judy, but is often called underrated.  
- **Tier**: Usually **B+ to A-**. Solid choice, especially if you like bears, cottagecore builds, or gentle villagers.  

---

### Bottom Line  
Megan is one of the **best big-bear villagers**: calm, cute without being flashy, and a good fit for cozy, nature-themed islands.  

Want me to line her up against **the other normal bears/cubs** (like Maple, Pekoe, Fauna, etc.) so you can see exactly where she ranks within her personality group?

---

**User:**

Celia

---

**Assistant:**

**Celia** is a **normal eagle** who brings a softer, elegant touch to a species usually dominated by cranky or jock types.  

---

### Core Details  
- **Species/Personality**: Eagle / Normal  
- **Catchphrase**: “feathers”  
- **Appearance**: White eagle with green wingtips, yellow beak, and gentle expression.  
- **House (NH)**: Refined, chapel-like interior with white brick wallpaper, harp, organ — very serene atmosphere.  
- **Hobby**: Nature  

---

### Reputation  
- **Fan perception**:  
  - Well-liked for her elegant and calming design.  
  - Stands out among eagles because she isn’t gruff or patriotic — instead she feels peaceful and almost “angelic.”  
  - Often compared favorably to Amelia (snooty eagle) and Apollo (cranky eagle), since she brings balance to the eagle lineup.  
- **Tier**: Usually **A-tier**. Not a cult favorite like Fauna or Judy, but a strong, respected normal villager — especially valued on cottagecore or nature-themed islands.  

---

### Bottom Line  
Celia is one of the **best eagle villagers overall**, and a good choice if you want a calm, graceful presence rather than another “tough bird.”  

Want me to show you how **Celia stacks up against the other eagles** (Apollo, Amelia, Sterling, Frank, etc.) so you can see the full eagle hierarchy?

**User:**

Jay

---

**Assistant:**

**Jay** is a **jock bird** who’s been around since the very first *Animal Crossing*.  

---

### Core Details  
- **Species/Personality**: Bird / Jock  
- **Catchphrase**: “heeeeeyy”  
- **Appearance**: Bright blue bird with white belly, red head markings — very blue-jay inspired.  
- **House (NH)**: Sporty, exercise-heavy interior with weights and a punching bag.  
- **Hobby**: Fitness  

---

### Reputation  
- **Fan perception**:  
  - Classic character, well-recognized by longtime players.  
  - Considered one of the *better jock designs* — simple, cheerful, fits his personality without being obnoxious.  
  - Not “top-tier” like Raymond/Marshal-level hype, but respected and often kept for nostalgia.  
- **Tier**: **B+ to A-**. Above-average jock villager; solid design, no glaring flaws.  

---

### Bottom Line  
Jay is a **strong, reliable jock**: bright, athletic, and likeable without going over the top. He doesn’t have cult status, but if you want a jock who feels classic and cheerful, he’s a safe bet.  

Want me to give you a **best vs. worst jocks quick list** so you can see where Jay really sits compared to guys like Bam, Ribbot, Tybalt, and Moose?
