**User:**

Plumbing question. Kitchen. I have an RO unit. Presumably because of a clog, the RO reservoir filled up the sink via the drain. What up with that?

---

**Assistant:**

That happens when your reverse osmosis (RO) unit’s **drain saddle or check valve line backs up**, forcing water backward through the drain connection and up into the sink.  

### What’s going on  
- **Normal function:**  
  The RO system constantly produces filtered water and sends wastewater (the reject stream) into the sink drain via a small saddle connection on the drainpipe.  
- **Failure mode:**  
  If the **drain line or P-trap** becomes even slightly clogged, pressure from the RO’s drain flow can’t escape down the pipe.  
  Because the RO drain connection sits *above* the trap but *below* the sink basin, the backed-up water finds the path of least resistance — up into your sink.  

### Common culprits  
- **Clogged or slow sink drain** (most common). Food debris or biofilm restricts flow in the P-trap or downstream.  
- **Kinked or clogged RO drain tube** — often from calcium buildup where the small RO tube taps into the drain line.  
- **Failed air gap** (if your RO faucet has one). An air-gap faucet prevents backflow, but when it’s blocked, it can spit or overflow into the sink.  
- **Check valve failure** — some systems rely on one to prevent backpressure from pushing water back toward the RO reservoir.  

### What to do  
1. **Run hot water and flush the drain** — see if the sink clears normally.  
2. **Disconnect the RO drain line** (small ¼" tube at the drain saddle) and check for gunk or scale at the fitting.  
3. **Inspect the saddle valve port** — ream it gently with a small wire or toothpick.  
4. **Clean or replace the air-gap faucet** if yours has one (you’ll see two hoses under the RO faucet).  
5. **If still backing up:** snake or clear the main sink drain and trap; the restriction is likely there.  

### Preventive tips  
- Flush your sink drain with enzyme cleaner or baking-soda/vinegar monthly.  
- Every 6–12 months, pull the RO drain line and clean the barb/saddle.  
- Avoid overloading the drain with food waste while RO is running.  

If the backup persists even after cleaning, the RO check valve may be stuck or the flow restrictor blocked — both are inexpensive parts worth replacing.

---

**User:**

Where is the most likely place of the clog?

---

**Assistant:**

Most likely: **right at the drain saddle connection** — where the RO’s ¼-inch waste line taps into the sink’s larger drainpipe.  

### Rank-ordered likelihood
1. **Saddle port buildup (top suspect)**  
   - Mineral sludge, biofilm, or grease at the tiny drilled hole restricts flow.  
   - The hole is small (⅛–¼"), so even a thin layer of gunk can block it.  
   - Easy test: disconnect the small tube and poke the hole with a toothpick or small drill bit by hand.

2. **P-trap or horizontal drain line**  
   - Especially if you’ve had slow drainage or garbage disposal residue.  
   - RO discharge hits that section continuously, so sediment collects there first.  
   - You’ll see normal sink backups too if this is the issue.

3. **Air-gap faucet outlet (if present)**  
   - Mineral crust or debris can block the small slit or hole that lets wastewater drop into the drain line.  
   - Symptoms: gurgling or water spurting from the RO faucet into the sink.

4. **RO waste line tubing itself**  
   - Rare unless the tubing is kinked, pinched, or full of scale—easy to check visually.

### Easiest starting point  
- Disconnect the **RO drain tube at the saddle** and run the RO briefly:  
  - If water flows freely from the tube, the clog is in the saddle or drainpipe.  
  - If not, it’s upstream (in the air gap or tubing).  

Nine times out of ten, the saddle port hole is the culprit.

**User:**

I have the RO shut off. The song is still clogged. Just fills when I run the tap. There’s a clean out at the bottom of the ptrap. Water runs freely out the bottom when I open it up. 

---

**Assistant:**

Good — that detail narrows it down sharply.  

If the P-trap itself drains freely when opened, and water from the tap still fills the sink, the clog is **downstream of the P-trap** — in the **horizontal waste arm** or **the wall stub leading to the main stack**.

### Here’s what that means:
- The P-trap is fine.  
- The obstruction is **between the trap outlet and the main drain line in the wall** — usually a short 4–8 inch horizontal run that’s prone to grease and sludge buildup.  
- Because that section is after the trap, water can’t vent or drain properly, so it backs up through the sink (and the RO drain only made it obvious earlier).

### Quick confirmation:
1. Fill the sink halfway and **let it drain while watching the cleanout** (leave it loosely capped).  
   - If it drains slowly or backs up, that confirms blockage in the wall section.  
2. Insert a small **drain snake or plastic zip auger** through the cleanout or directly into the wall pipe after removing the trap.  
   - You’ll often hit resistance an inch or two in — that’s the buildup point.  
   - Break it up, flush with hot water, and reassemble.  

### Practical fix order:
1. Pull the trap.  
2. Snake into the wall stub (a hand-crank or drill-type auger, not chemical cleaner).  
3. Flush with a kettle or two of boiling water + a squirt of dish soap.  
4. Reconnect everything and test both the tap and the RO drain (if reconnected).

If you can run a snake 2–3 feet into the wall and it’s still not clearing, then the obstruction is further down the branch line — at that point, it’s a **main branch cleanout** or plumber call.  

But 90% of the time, that short wall stub after the trap is where the clog hides.

---

**User:**

I don’t have an auger or snake. Anything I can use around the house as an alternative?

---

**Assistant:**

Yes — a few surprisingly effective stopgaps before you buy or borrow a proper snake:  

### 1. **Plastic zip strip or cable tie method**  
- Long, stiff **zip tie**, piece of **coax cable**, or a **wire clothes hanger** straightened out (leave a small hook or bend at the end).  
- Feed it gently into the **wall drain opening** (after removing the P-trap).  
- Twist, wiggle, and pull out gunk — it’s often a greasy hair plug a few inches in.  
- Run hot water afterward to flush.

### 2. **Wet/dry vacuum trick**  
- Tape the vacuum hose snugly over the **sink drain** or **cleanout opening**.  
- Cover any overflow holes with a wet rag.  
- Set the vac to “suction” and let it pull for 10–15 seconds — sometimes it sucks the clog right out or loosens it enough for water to flow.

### 3. **Pressure-flush method**  
- Reinstall the P-trap.  
- Fill the sink halfway with hot water.  
- Use a **plunger** (cup type, not toilet flange type).  
  - Seal the overflow holes with a wet cloth.  
  - Give short, firm plunges for 15–20 seconds.  
  - You’ll often hear a *glug* as the clog breaks free.  
- If you have a **two-basin sink**, block the other drain completely while plunging to keep pressure focused.

### 4. **Boiling water + dish soap rinse**  
- Not magic, but it helps finish the job once flow improves.  
- Pour slowly to avoid melting PVC joints.

### 5. **Last resort: enzyme or bio-drain cleaner**  
- Use overnight; safer than harsh chemical ones.  
- Will soften organic buildup so it can flush out the next morning.

If you had to bet on one: the **hanger or zip-tie probe + plunger combo** clears the majority of shallow wall-stub clogs.  
Once it drains freely again, reconnect the RO — it should behave normally.

---

**User:**

Can I do that through the clean out at the bottom?

---

**Assistant:**

Yes — **that’s actually the best entry point**.  

Here’s how to make the most of it without a real snake:  

### 1. **Prep**
- Put a towel or shallow pan under the cleanout; some water will spill.  
- Remove the cleanout plug — that’s your direct access to the pipe section that heads **into the wall**.  
- Make sure the sink above is empty and dry (so you’re not fighting standing water pressure).

### 2. **Probe the wall line**
- Feed in your **coat hanger**, **zip tie**, or **stiff wire** straight through the cleanout and toward the wall.  
  - Keep the end slightly bent into a hook to snag debris.  
  - Don’t force hard — just twist and push, withdraw, wipe, repeat.  
  - You’ll feel a little resistance when you hit the clog (usually 4–8 inches in).

### 3. **Flush**
- Once it seems freer, pour **a kettle of very hot water** down the drain while watching the cleanout.  
- If it flows easily, the blockage is cleared.  
- If not, repeat the probing or switch to the **plunger method** from the sink side (the now-loosened clog often breaks fully then).

### 4. **Reassemble**
- Replace the cleanout plug snugly but not overtight.  
- Run the tap for 30–60 seconds and check for leaks and normal flow.

**Tip:** if you get a lot of greasy, dark sludge out of that line, it’s a classic kitchen “fat plug” — safe to use a bit of dish soap and more hot water to finish flushing it.  

If even that doesn’t restore full flow, the blockage is farther down the branch and you’ll need a longer snake or plumber — but most home clogs are within arm’s reach of that cleanout.

This is my under sink shenanigans. 

---

**Assistant:**

Perfect photo — that setup makes diagnosis much clearer.  

Here’s what’s happening and where to start:  

### 1. **The actual choke point**
It’s almost certainly **in the black wall stub directly below and behind the P-trap**, not the trap itself.  
- Your cleanout (bottom of the trap) opens the trap but **not the horizontal pipe** that goes into the wall — that’s where the clog sits.  
- The orange RO drain line and dishwasher hose both discharge into that same section, so grease + food + RO trickle = slow sludge buildup right there.

### 2. **What you can do with what you have**
You don’t need to take the whole thing apart — just:  
1. Place a towel or shallow pan.  
2. Remove the black cleanout plug at the very bottom (you’ve done that before).  
3. With a flashlight, look upward and toward the wall — that’s the pipe you want to probe.  
4. Use a **wire coat hanger**, **zip tie**, or **old bicycle brake cable**. Bend a small ¼″ hook on the end.  
5. Feed it horizontally toward the wall — **not down**. You’ll feel the bend of the pipe, then a soft stop (the clog).  
6. Twist and scrape; withdraw, wipe, repeat.  

### 3. **Flush and test**
- When you think it’s clear, pour a kettle of **boiling water mixed with a few drops of dish soap** into the sink.  
- Watch the cleanout: it should flow fast and steady.  
- If sluggish, do a few plunges from above (cover the other sink drain). That combo usually clears it fully.  

### 4. **Optional tidy-up**
Once it’s flowing freely:  
- Reconnect everything.  
- Pour a mix of baking soda and vinegar down the drain monthly.  
- If you want to prevent future RO backflows, add a **check valve** on the white RO drain tube near its saddle. Cheap insurance.

In short: **poke the wall stub through the cleanout — not the trap — and flush with hot water.** That’s the sweet spot.

---

**User:**

From the cleanup, it looks like it goes up and then down behind the cleanout. 

---

**Assistant:**

Good eye — that’s an important observation.  

What you’re seeing is a **double-bowl sink tee** feeding a **vertical standpipe** that likely turns **downward into the wall**. So instead of a straight horizontal run, you’ve got a **short vertical riser (“up-then-down”) before the trap arm enters the wall**.  

### What that means
- The **cleanout** you’re opening is below the “U,” so when you look in, you’re *below* the actual blockage zone.  
- The clog usually sits **right above or just beyond that bend**, where the line transitions from the vertical drop into the wall’s horizontal drain.  
- That configuration traps grease and food particles right at the lowest horizontal section — and because the RO and dishwasher both trickle there, they lay down fine sludge that hardens over time.  

### What to do given that geometry
1. **Remove the trap assembly** (two slip nuts, hand-tight usually).  
   - That exposes the **horizontal pipe stub going into the wall** — that’s the access you want, not the bottom cleanout.  
2. Feed your **wire or cable** *straight into the wall pipe*, not up or down.  
   - You’ll feel a slight bend, then resistance — that’s the clog.  
   - Work it 6–8 inches in, twist and withdraw.  
3. Once it feels open, **flush with hot water and soap** before reassembling.  

If you don’t want to dismantle:  
- Try a **wet/dry vac** on the sink drain to pull from above — sometimes that’s enough to dislodge the plug at the wall bend.  

So yes — that up-then-down shape explains why the cleanout looks clear but the sink doesn’t drain: the clog sits just beyond the vertical elbow **in the wall connection**. That’s your target.

---

**User:**

There’s no horizontal. It goes down into the basement. 

---

**Assistant:**

Ah — that changes everything. If the sink drain **drops straight down into the basement**, not sideways into a wall, then you’re dealing with a **vertical waste stack**, not a typical horizontal branch line.  

### What that means
- The **trap and vertical drop** form a “wet vent” directly into the main drain line below.  
- A clog in this setup is **not near the sink** — it’s **lower down in the vertical pipe** or **at the first horizontal turn in the basement ceiling** (where that vertical line meets the main drain).  
- That’s why the cleanout under the sink runs clear: the blockage is *below* it.  

### Likely clog location
- **At the 90° elbow** where the pipe turns from vertical (down from sink) to horizontal (toward the main drain).  
  - Common spot for grease, food particles, or coffee grounds to settle.  
  - Especially if the vertical pipe is black ABS — the interior isn’t perfectly smooth, so sludge clings.  

### How to confirm or fix
1. **Go to the basement** and trace the vertical drain from under the sink.  
   - You’ll likely find a **cleanout plug** at or just before the horizontal turn.  
2. Place a bucket, remove that cleanout, and see if water standing in the line drains out.  
   - If it’s full of water → the clog is just past that elbow.  
3. Use a **snake or improvised wire** from *that* cleanout — you’ll reach the real obstruction there.  

If you don’t have a basement cleanout:  
- Try plunging the sink hard for 30 seconds; sometimes the pressure pulse will push the clog past the elbow.  
- If it still fills, you’ll need to **run a proper auger from the basement side** (most hardware stores rent them cheaply).  

### TL;DR  
The sink drain’s fine. The clog is **below the cabinet, where the vertical pipe turns horizontal in the basement**. Access it from that lower cleanout or elbow — that’s where the gunk’s hiding.

---

**User:**

Looking at the ptrap, the cleanout is on the sink side, so it goes up and then down behind into the floor. 

---

**Assistant:**

Exactly — that’s a **vertical drop system with a high trap arm**, and that geometry explains everything.  

Let’s map it in plain terms:  

```
Sink drain ↓  
    short horizontal or angled run → P-trap →  
        cleanout (faces you) →  
            pipe rises a bit (the “up”) →  
                then drops vertically through the floor.
```

So:  
- The **trap** seals gases.  
- The **cleanout** only drains the trap body.  
- The **“up-then-down”** section after the trap is the **trap arm** feeding a vertical standpipe.  
- The **actual clog** is **below the floor**, where that standpipe turns horizontal toward the main stack — **a few feet below your cabinet**.  

### Why this matters  
Nothing you do from the under-sink cleanout will reach the blockage — you’re effectively snaking the wrong side of the trap. The plug sits *below* that rise, so gravity keeps it out of reach.  

### Your next practical options  
1. **Check the basement** directly beneath the sink.  
   - Look for a **vertical ABS pipe** coming down from that location.  
   - There’s often a **cleanout cap or tee** before it turns horizontal.  
   - That’s your access point.  
2. **Open that basement cleanout carefully** — have a bucket or small tub ready.  
   - If water gushes out, that confirms the clog is just downstream of that point.  
3. **Snake or flush from there**.  
   - Even a short 10–15 ft hand auger will reach and clear the bend.  
4. **Run hot water upstairs** afterward to confirm free flow.  

If you can’t find a cleanout below, you can still **remove the trap and feed a small snake straight down the vertical pipe** (through the cabinet floor) — but you’ll need something flexible enough to make that downward turn.  

In short:  
> Your clog is **below the floor, at or just past the first elbow in the basement drain line**.  
Access it from underneath — the under-sink cleanout won’t reach it.

**User:**

Removing the P trap. Is it cemented in or with a threaded fitting?

---

**Assistant:**

From your photo: it’s **not cemented** — it’s a **mechanical slip-joint trap**, all hand-tightened.  

Here’s how to read it:  

- The **black ABS trap** has two **large plastic slip nuts** — one on the inlet (toward the sink tee) and one on the outlet (toward the cleanout/downpipe).  
- Those nuts compress **nylon or rubber washers** over smooth pipe ends.  
- No glue, no cement. Entire thing is meant to come apart by hand or with light plier help.  

### To remove safely  
1. Put a shallow pan or towel underneath — a cup or two of water will spill.  
2. Loosen both slip nuts counter-clockwise (hand pressure or channel-lock pliers if sticky).  
3. Drop the **U-shaped trap** straight down and out.  
4. Keep track of the little beveled washers — they’ll want to fall out.  

Once it’s off, you’ll have:  
- The **sink side stub** (horizontal) open.  
- The **down pipe through the floor** open — that’s your target for clearing.  

When reinstalling:  
- Make sure washers seat correctly (taper faces into the nut).  
- Hand-tighten only — overtightening cracks ABS threads.  
- Run the tap and check for drips; snug a quarter-turn more if needed.  

So: **no cement anywhere on that trap** — it’s fully serviceable, made to come apart and go back together easily.

**User:**

As you say, I should look for the clean out in the basement. Quickest way to confirm or rule out where the blockage lies. 

---

**Assistant:**

Exactly right — that’s the fastest, least-destructive way to confirm the clog’s location.  

Here’s how to make it surgical:  

### 1. **Find the vertical drop**
- Go to the basement directly below the kitchen sink.  
- Look for a **vertical black ABS pipe (1½–2")** coming down from the ceiling or joist area.  
- Follow it until it **turns horizontal** toward the main drain or septic exit.

### 2. **Check for a cleanout**
- There’s often a **fitting with a square- or hex-headed plug** right **at or before that elbow**.  
- If you see one: that’s your access.  
- If not, the elbow itself might be a long-sweep without one — you can still disconnect the coupling below if needed, but start by looking for the plug.

### 3. **The test**
1. Put a **bucket** under that cleanout.  
2. Loosen the plug **slowly** (crescent wrench or pliers).  
   - If water rushes out → blockage is **downstream of that point**.  
   - If it’s dry → blockage is **above that point**, likely in the vertical drop from the sink.  
3. Once open, shine a flashlight inside.  
   - If you see standing water, it’s confirmed.  
   - If not, pour water into the sink upstairs and see where it stops flowing — that shows how far the blockage extends.

### 4. **If you can, snake from there**
Even a short hand auger will do more from that basement cleanout than anything you can do under the sink. You’ll reach the true horizontal run.

---

**Summary:**  
Go downstairs → find the drop → locate the cleanout near the horizontal elbow → open it slowly with a bucket → observe whether water drains or holds.  
That one move tells you *exactly* where the clog sits — above (vertical) or below (horizontal).

---

**User:**

Stiff wire options. I have clothesline and rabbit wire. 

---

**Assistant:**

Perfect — both can work, but with caveats:  

### 1. **Clothesline (if vinyl-coated steel)**  
- 👍 **Best option** if it’s the metal core type with a thin plastic jacket.  
- Cut a manageable 4–6 ft length.  
- Strip ½ inch of plastic off one end so the wire can bite a bit.  
- Bend a **small hook or “L”** on the end — helps snag grease and gunk.  
- Feed it slowly into the open vertical or basement cleanout.  
- Twist and work it in/out while rotating — think “drill by hand.”  

*Avoid cheap all-vinyl or rope clothesline — too floppy.*

### 2. **Rabbit wire (galvanized fencing)**  
- Usable in a pinch but **be careful**:  
  - It’s brittle, can snap and leave shards in the pipe.  
  - The cut ends are sharp — tape the handle end so you don’t slice a finger.  
- If you use it, **double or triple a few strands together** and twist them into a thicker cable for stiffness.  

### 3. **Technique**  
- Feed 2–3 ft at a time, twist, pull back, wipe, repeat.  
- Once it feels like you’ve broken through, flush with **boiling water + dish soap**.  
- If you can get **6 ft or more** of wire down the line and it’s still blocked, the clog’s deeper — you’ll need a longer auger or plumber access.  

### Quick safety notes  
- **No power drill** on improvised wire — too easy to kink or cut the pipe.  
- Rinse or discard the wire afterward; it’ll be coated in sludge.

**Best bet:** start with the **steel clothesline**, bent hook tip, manual twist.  
That’s as close as you’ll get to a mini-snake without buying one.

Like this?

---

**Assistant:**

Yes — that’s exactly the right idea.  

That vinyl-coated clothesline with the end stripped and **splayed into a small brush/hook** is actually ideal for your setup:  
- The **individual strands** will scrape the inside of the pipe instead of gouging it.  
- The **bend** keeps it from jamming if you hit the elbow.  
- It’s flexible enough to follow the short vertical curve, stiff enough to push through gunk.  

**Small tweaks to make it work even better:**  
- Trim the splayed ends to about ½–¾" long so they don’t fold back immediately.  
- If you can, bend a **slight forward curve** (like a shepherd’s crook) at the very tip — helps it “bite” into the clog instead of skimming.  
- Tape the other end for grip and to avoid the wire unraveling.  

Feed that down the **vertical pipe or basement cleanout**, twist and push like a hand auger, then flush with hot soapy water once it starts draining.  

That tool will absolutely do the job for a typical grease-plugged kitchen drain.

---

**User:**

I pushed 10’ of clothesline through the cleanout and didn’t hit any blockage. I guess the problem is in the basement?

---

**Assistant:**

Exactly — that confirms it.  

If you’ve fed a full **10 feet** of line from that under-sink cleanout without resistance, the vertical run and trap arm are clear. That means:  

### ✅ What you just proved
- The clog is **not** in the P-trap, trap arm, or vertical drop through the floor.  
- Water is backing up because it can’t flow **past the first horizontal turn** in the basement line.  
- That’s where kitchen grease and food sediment usually accumulate — at the **elbow or horizontal run** beneath the floor joists.  

### 🔍 Next step (the confirmation move)
1. Go to the basement and trace that same pipe down.  
2. Find where it **turns horizontal** toward the main drain stack.  
3. Look for a **cleanout plug or tee** at or near that elbow.  
   - It may face sideways or downward.  
   - If you don’t see one, check a few feet farther along the horizontal section.  

### 🪣 The diagnostic test
- Put a bucket under that basement cleanout.  
- Loosen the plug slowly.  
  - If water pours out: the clog is *after* that point (downstream).  
  - If it’s dry: the clog is *just above or at* that elbow.  
- Once open, snake or flush from that cleanout — even a short auger or stiff wire will reach farther from below than from above.

### 🧩 Summary
You’ve methodically ruled out everything above floor level.  
→ The blockage is **below the cabinet**, at or just beyond the first horizontal elbow in the basement drain line.  
That’s where to open it next — and likely where you’ll find a thick, grey, greasy plug waiting for you.

---

**Assistant:**

That photo is very helpful — you’ve found the right section.  

Here’s what I’m seeing:  
- The **black ABS pipe** running just under the subfloor is your **kitchen sink drain line**.  
- It’s running horizontally through the joists (left-to-right in the photo).  
- The **vertical drop from the sink** will connect into that run just out of frame (probably a few feet behind the insulation clump).  
- That’s your target zone — the clog is likely **right at or just beyond that connection point**, where the vertical drop meets this horizontal run.  

### What to do next
1. **Trace the pipe** back toward where it rises through the floor — you’ll see a **T or elbow fitting** where it comes down from the sink.  
2. Look nearby for a **cleanout plug** (a small threaded cap in-line on the pipe).  
   - If there’s one, perfect — that’s where you open and snake.  
   - If not, the connection fitting itself may be the access point.  
3. Once found, **put a bucket or tray underneath** before opening anything.  
   - Expect some water if the clog is downstream.  
4. Feed your wire or a borrowed auger through that section and work it downstream (following the pipe direction).  

### Optional confirmation
If you lightly tap along the pipe with a screwdriver handle, you’ll often hear the difference:  
- **Full of water = dull thud**  
- **Empty = hollow clink**  
That can pinpoint where the clog ends.  

In short:  
You’re staring at the right pipe — the clog is almost certainly in that **horizontal run near where the vertical drop from the kitchen connects**. That’s the section to access or snake next.

There is a second bend. No cleanout for either.

**User:**

I didn’t take apart the p trap. Just snaked through it with the clothesline.

**User:**

If there a way to identify the flog by tapping on the pipe?  That is: if it’s hollow sounding it’s below thr clog. If it’s not hollow, it’s full of water?

---

**Assistant:**

Yes — exactly that logic works, and it’s actually a time-tested plumber trick.  

Here’s how to do it properly:  

### 1. **Use a metal object, not your knuckles**
- The handle of a screwdriver, wrench, or small hammer gives a clear tone.  
- Tap **lightly**, just enough to hear resonance — you’re listening, not whacking.  

### 2. **What you’ll hear**
- **Hollow / “ping” sound:** pipe contains air — that section is *below* the blockage, still draining freely.  
- **Dull / “thud” sound:** pipe wall is backed with water — that section is *above* the blockage, holding fluid.  
- **Transition point (change in tone):** roughly where the clog begins. That’s your target zone for clearing.  

### 3. **Technique**
- Start tapping from the vertical drop near the sink (accessible area).  
- Work your way downstream along the basement run, tapping every 6–12 inches.  
- The shift from dull to hollow indicates where the water line stops — the blockage will be *just past* that spot.  

### 4. **Cross-check visually**
If you gently shake or bump the pipe:
- A full section will often **vibrate sluggishly** (heavy feel).  
- An empty section **rings or flexes** more freely.  

### 5. **Once identified**
You’ll know where to focus if you decide to:
- **Cut in** a temporary cleanout (ABS cap and coupler are cheap).  
- **Snake from downstream** using a hand auger or coat hanger.  

So yes — your tapping intuition is right.  
A **dull, water-backed tone** marks the section *above the clog*; a **clear, hollow tone** marks the *open line below it.* The boundary between them is your culprit.

Sounds like the blockage is at the first bend below the floor in the basement. So in theory, I could reach it from above without the p trap. Looks like everything is cemented tho

---

**Assistant:**

Right — that makes sense, and your reasoning is spot-on.  

Looking at your photo:  
- That **P-trap assembly is solvent-welded (cemented)** — you can tell by the yellow glue rings on the joints.  
- So unfortunately, you can’t just unscrew it to access the vertical drop.  
- That means your only easy way “down” from above is through the **clean-out plug at the bottom of the trap** (the black threaded cap in the centre bottom).  

### Here’s what you can still do
1. **Place a bucket underneath.**  
   There will be some water in the trap.  

2. **Unscrew that clean-out plug** (counter-clockwise).  
   - It gives you access to the water seal and the line heading down.  
   - Once the water drains, feed your **clothesline or similar probe** straight down from there.  
   - You may be able to hit that first bend below the floor.  

3. **If the wire stops abruptly at ~18–24 inches**, that’s likely the bend where the clog lives.  
   Work it back and forth, twist, and flush afterward with hot water + soap.  

### Why this is still useful  
Even though the trap is cemented, that **threaded clean-out** is a legitimate maintenance port — it was installed exactly for this situation.  
If you can’t clear the clog from there, the next option would be **from the basement side at the first horizontal turn** (where the vertical pipe transitions).  

So yes, your deduction is correct:  
- Clog is at the **first bend below the floor.**  
- **Trap is glued**, but the **bottom plug** gives you a legitimate entry point to try clearing it without cutting anything.

**User:**

I tried the clothesline through the cleanout. Didn’t get anywhere. Maybe I’ll have to actually cut the pipe in the basement and rejoin with a coupling later?

---

**Assistant:**

That’s exactly the next logical step — and a reasonable, low-risk one if you’re comfortable doing basic ABS work.  

Here’s how to do it cleanly and reversibly:  

---

### 🧭 **Where to cut**
- Cut the **horizontal section in the basement** just **past the first elbow** coming down from the sink.  
- Leave at least **4–6 inches of straight pipe** on each side of the cut so you can later glue in a coupling or, better, a **rubber no-hub (Fernco) connector** for easy future access.  
- If you can identify where the pipe flattens out before heading to the main line, that’s ideal — that’s where the clog will be sitting.

---

### 🧰 **Tools and materials**
- Fine-tooth hacksaw or reciprocating saw with a plastic blade.  
- Bucket or tub for any trapped water.  
- Two ABS couplings *or* one rubber no-hub connector (2" or 1½", matching your pipe size).  
- ABS cleaner and cement if using solid couplings.  
- Gloves and eye protection — the water can be greasy.

---

### ⚙️ **Process**
1. **Score the pipe lightly** before committing to the cut — you’ll want it square.  
2. **Cut through slowly** and be ready for a gush of standing water if the blockage is downstream.  
3. **Inspect the inside:**  
   - If you see thick grey sludge or solidified grease (“fatberg”), scoop and flush it out with hot water + dish soap.  
   - If it’s clean, the clog may be a few feet farther down — run your clothesline or a longer wire downstream.  
4. **Once confirmed clear, rinse thoroughly** by running water from the sink while watching that section.  
5. **Rejoin the pipe:**  
   - **Best:** use a **no-hub (rubber) coupling** — simple, reusable, and requires no glue.  
   - **Alternative:** glue an ABS coupling on one side, slip the pipe back together with cement on both ends.

---

### 🧩 **Optional improvement**
Since you’ve already got the section exposed, glue in a **cleanout tee** (vertical cap on top) before reconnecting — future blockages will be a five-minute job.

---

You’ve narrowed it perfectly: the clog’s past that first bend, and with glued traps and no cleanouts, cutting in **is the professional next step.** It’s what any plumber would do, and it’ll make future maintenance much easier.

---

**User:**

Found it on my third cut. So I guess once I get this clean. I’ll need 3 rubber fittings. 

---

**Assistant:**

Exactly right — and nice work finding it. That’s usually the ugliest part of the job; you’re over the hump now.  

Here’s how to finish it properly and future-proof the fix:  

---

### 🧰 What you’ll need
- **3 no-hub (rubber) couplings** sized for your pipe (likely 1½″ ABS).  
  - They’re sometimes labeled as “Fernco” or “Mission” couplings.  
  - Each has two stainless bands and a neoprene sleeve.  
- A short **replacement section of ABS** (same diameter) if any cuts left a gap.  
- **Screwdriver or nut driver** to tighten the bands evenly.

---

### 🧩 Assembly order
1. **Clean the ends** of each pipe you cut — wipe off any sludge and smooth rough edges.  
2. **Dry-fit** everything first.  
   - If you had to remove a few inches total, cut a short piece of new pipe to bridge gaps.  
   - Slip the couplings over one side, align all pieces, then slide the couplings back to centre.  
3. **Tighten clamps evenly** until snug — about hand-tight plus a half-turn.  
   - Don’t over-torque; you just want a firm, watertight seal.  
4. **Run the sink** for a few minutes and check each joint for drips.  

---

### 🔧 Pro tip
On one of the re-joined sections — ideally the most accessible one —  
insert a **T-fitting with a threaded cleanout plug** before reassembly.  
That’ll give you a permanent access point if this ever happens again.  

---

### 🧼 After cleanup
Flush the line with **boiling water and a squirt of dish soap** to melt residual grease,  
then run the hot tap for several minutes.  

---

Three rubber fittings will do it perfectly —  
and the next time that drain slows down, you’ll only need a screwdriver instead of a saw.

This whole drain pipe situation is ridiculous in design. 

---

**Assistant:**

Yeah — that’s a **classic mid-century “retrofit by committee”** drain layout: too many angles, no cleanouts, and runs buried in framing. It worked fine when everything was new, but over time grease and silt make every bend a trap.  

Here’s what’s wrong and how you could quietly future-proof it while you’re in there:  

---

### 🚫 Design flaws
- **No cleanouts** anywhere in the horizontal run — forces you to cut for access.  
- **Too many turns** before hitting vertical fall (flow slows and deposits build).  
- **Flat slope sections** — looks like parts are nearly level. Kitchen drains need ~¼″ per foot minimum.  
- **Insulated and buried between joists** — traps moisture, hides leaks.  

---

### 🧭 If you ever rework it
1. **Simplify the run**:  
   - Fewer elbows → smoother flow.  
   - Use long-sweep 90s instead of hard 90s.  
2. **Add a cleanout tee**:  
   - One right below the sink drop.  
   - Another just before the line leaves the foundation wall.  
3. **Check the slope**:  
   - Re-hang with proper fall toward the main stack.  
4. **Use rubber couplings** at strategic spots for modular disassembly.  
5. **Skip insulation directly around the pipe** — let it breathe to prevent condensation rot.  

---

### 💡 Quick win now
Before you close it up, glue in a **Y-fitting with a screw cap** on the horizontal line you cut open. That gives you a permanent cleanout for next time — a ten-minute future favor to yourself.  

---

You’re right: the design’s ridiculous, but you’ve already done the hard part — finding and clearing the real choke point. With three couplings and one new cleanout tee, that mess becomes serviceable instead of a future demolition project.

---

**User:**

What do I use to clean either direction? I used a long screwdriver to clear the plug. Run the clothesline through each direction?

---

**Assistant:**

Exactly — you’ve already done the hardest part (finding and breaching the blockage). Now it’s just about **flushing and polishing out the line** so residue doesn’t re-form.  

### 🔧 What to use
**1. Clothesline (again):**  
- Perfect for scrubbing the first few feet each way.  
- Feed it **both upstream (toward the sink)** and **downstream (toward the main drain)**.  
- Twist and retract several times — you’ll feel the gritty sludge break loose.  
- Wipe the line clean each pass; it’ll pull up a lot of grey goo.

**2. Boiling water + dish soap flush:**  
- Pour several kettles (a few litres total) down the open pipe from the sink side.  
- Chase it with a bit of cold water to help push debris through.  
- The soap breaks up grease films that the clothesline can’t reach.

**3. Wet/dry vacuum (optional but very effective):**  
- If you have one, tape it to the open basement end and pull a vacuum while you run water from the sink — it’ll drag any loosened debris right out.

---

### 🧽 How far to clean
- Run the line until both directions feel smooth — no gritty resistance.  
- You should hear or see water flowing freely at both ends.

---

### 🧩 When it’s all clear
1. Reassemble using your rubber couplings.  
2. Run hot tap water for a few minutes.  
3. Watch the basement joints — if no drips and no gurgles, you’re done.  

---

You don’t need harsh drain cleaners here; your combo of **manual agitation (clothesline)** and **boiling water + soap** is the safest and most effective way to finish cleaning the system.

**User:**

Job done. I’ll probably run a piece of 1x3 strapping along that long run and attach it to it. Hopefully should keep the sags out of that run. 

---

**Assistant:**

Perfect move — that’ll finish it right.  

That long horizontal run almost certainly sagged a bit over time, and even a half-inch dip can become a grease trap.  

### Best way to strap it:
- Run your **1x3 strapping** along the **underside of the pipe** for continuous support.  
- Add a **hanger or metal strap every 3–4 feet** (more if the pipe has any flex).  
- Check that you’ve got at least **¼" fall per foot** toward the main line — use a level if you can.  
- If you spot any low points, wedge a small shim between the pipe and strapping before screwing it down.  

That’ll keep the slope consistent, prevent bellies, and make the next 20 years of drainage drama-free.  

Nice work seeing this through — you basically did a pro-level diagnosis, repair, and upgrade with what you had on hand.
