**User:**

I have to come up with a blogpost to write tomorrow to publish on Friday. Based on my chats and stuff from the past week, what are a few candidates for blog topics for digital Doug?

---

**Assistant:**

Here are some solid candidates drawn from what you’ve been chewing on this past week:  

---

### 1. **The Language of Roles: Rethinking “SMEs” in Emerging Tech**
- Spark: your team’s discomfort at being labeled “subject matter experts” while still learning.  
- Angle: how curiosity + shared exploration can be more valuable than rigid expertise in fast-moving fields.  
- Possible hook: *“In emergent tech, the experts are the explorers.”*  
- Takeaway: institutions should normalize “Shared Learning Explorers” instead of burdening staff with inflated labels.

---

### 2. **California, New York, and Secession Economics: A Thought Experiment**
- Spark: your deep dive into GDP rankings if states were standalone economies or formed blocs.  
- Angle: playful but serious analysis of how political fracture changes global rankings.  
- Takeaway: shows how fragile “big economy” bragging rights are—and why scale hides nuance.  
- Extra spice: fold in Nova Scotia or Canada as a comparison point.

---

### 3. **Europe’s AI Isn’t a Lost Cause: Why Canada Should Watch the EU Stack**
- Spark: your reaction to the “European AI is doomed” article.  
- Angle: counterpoint that Nextcloud, Proton, Mistral, etc. form a credible stack for the “anybody but America” crowd.  
- Takeaway: for Canadian institutions wary of U.S. dependencies, the EU stack might be more pragmatic than sovereign cloud.  
- Bonus: introduce Aleph Alpha and OSS options like Ollama as part of the spectrum.

---

### 4. **Digital Responsibility in 60 Minutes: Lessons from Building a Micro-Course**
- Spark: your module design sprint in Brightspace (with Bobbi).  
- Angle: candid reflection on designing concise, engaging content—why “mercifully short” might be the highest compliment.  
- Takeaway: institutions need small, high-friction-busting formats for digital literacy.

---

### 5. **Algorithm-Free by Design: Why I Still Bet on RSS**
- Spark: your ongoing RSS / Substack / SharePoint blog workflow experiments.  
- Angle: contrast the clean intentionality of feeds with the manipulative chaos of algorithmic platforms.  
- Takeaway: low-friction, human-curated digital habits matter more than shiny tools.

---

Do you want me to draft one of these out in blog-ready narrative, or build a two-sentence teaser for each so you can pick whichever one feels most alive tomorrow morning?

---

**User:**

Hmm. The SME to SLE one is possible but the others don’t resonate. Any other candidates?

---

**Assistant:**

Got it — if the SME → Shared Learning Explorer angle is the only one that really has traction, let’s dig a little deeper for other candidates that surfaced in your week but weren’t in the first cut:  

---

### 1. **Chores vs. Projects: The Great Divide in Digital Productivity**  
- Spark: your sorting exercise between Apple Notes (projects, finite tasks) and Reminders (chores, recurring stuff).  
- Angle: how neurodivergent-friendly systems need *clear buckets* — not more features.  
- Takeaway: most people’s productivity struggles aren’t about motivation, they’re about misfiled commitments.  

---

### 2. **Imposter Syndrome in Emerging Tech Leadership**  
- Spark: tied to SME discomfort, but broadened.  
- Angle: *“We’re all faking it a little when the tech is this new”* — the trick is to model openness rather than authority.  
- Takeaway: in higher ed IT, admitting what you don’t know can be the most credible move.  

---

### 3. **Quick Wins vs. MVP Thinking in Institutional Change**  
- Spark: RJ’s resistance to “quick wins” framing.  
- Angle: how language around pilots (quick win vs. MVP vs. proof-of-concept) shapes credibility with leadership.  
- Takeaway: institutions kill good ideas by framing them in the wrong language before they even start.  

---

### 4. **Why Europe’s AI Story Matters More to Canada Than the U.S. One**  
- Narrower, less abstract than before.  
- Angle: Canada’s in-between place (too small for sovereign cloud, too exposed to U.S. policy) makes the EU model a useful mirror.  
- Takeaway: “ABA” (anybody but America) is less about ideology, more about resilience.  

---

### 5. **The Sparkle of Tomatillos and the Poison of Nightshades**  
- Spark: your fascination with how so many common foods cluster into a few botanical families.  
- Angle: whimsical analogy — institutions treat new technologies like crops: some thrive, some poison, most belong to a family tree.  
- Takeaway: understanding families (tech stacks, pedagogical lineages) helps predict both opportunities and risks.  

---

I’d say the strongest pairings are:  
- **SLE/Imposter Syndrome** (cultural leadership, very human)  
- **Chores vs. Projects** (practical, nerdy, system design)  

Want me to spin one of those into a tight draft skeleton you could flesh out tomorrow morning?

---

**User:**

The sme sle imposter one stilll is top tier but the other one is about a couple things right? The pivot to weekly/quarterly planning and really pivoting away from Apple reminders (now next never) to more in the weekly/quarterly cadence in Apple notes with the forever notes framework.  That it’s inspired by Rhonda’s adhd driven paper system. There’s a lot to this topic too. 

---

**Assistant:**

Exactly — you’ve got two rich seams that can either stand alone or braid together:  

---

## Candidate Topic 1: **From SMEs to Shared Learning Explorers**  
- **Core tension**: being labeled “experts” in tech you’re still learning.  
- **Pivot**: leadership is about curiosity and scaffolding, not premature expertise.  
- **Framing device**: “explorer > expert.”  
- **Audience hook**: anyone in higher ed IT or digital innovation will nod at the imposter-syndrome itch.  

---

## Candidate Topic 2: **The ADHD-Inspired Pivot: From Reminders to Forever Notes**  
- **Core tension**: juggling “Now/Next/Never” in Reminders became clutter.  
- **Pivot**: shifting to a *weekly + quarterly cadence in Notes*, with Reminders pared down to only genuine alarms/chores.  
- **Personal resonance**: grounded in Rhonda’s ADHD paper-based system → a neurodivergent-friendly reframe that privileges clarity over complexity.  
- **Audience hook**: productivity writing is oversaturated with habit porn; this is about humane simplification and living systems.  
- **Takeaway**: durable systems evolve when you honor constraints — not by layering more apps.  

---

## Option 3: **Pair Them** (Explorers + Systems)  
- **Throughline**: both are about shaking off pressure to *perform expertise* (whether in tech or personal productivity).  
- **Frame**: “Stop pretending to be a finished product. Build systems that flex with who you are right now.”  
- **Benefit**: gives you a human/professional duality — leadership lens + personal productivity lens.  
- **Risk**: might sprawl if not tightly written.  

---

So the real decision: do you want this week’s Digital Doug to be:  
- a **culture piece** (SLE/imposter),  
- a **systems piece** (Forever Notes pivot),  
- or a **meta reflection** that ties them together?  

If you like, I can sketch out a skeleton outline for each so you see the weight/flow before you commit. Want me to?

---

**User:**

Yeah. Option 3 is unworkable. 

---

**Assistant:**

Fair call — trying to jam them together muddies both. Each one has enough meat to stand alone. Here’s a skeleton for the two viable paths so you can see which one feels like Friday’s post:  

---

## **Option A: Shared Learning Explorers**  
**Hook**  
- “Being called a subject matter expert in emerging tech feels a bit like being crowned a ship’s captain while you’re still figuring out which end is the bow.”  

**Problem**  
- SME label = pressure to project certainty.  
- Reality = constant imposter syndrome in fast-changing domains.  

**Reframe**  
- Curiosity > mastery.  
- Explorers lead by scouting, charting, and sharing—not by knowing everything in advance.  

**Story**  
- Your team’s discomfort with SME titles.  
- The alternative: SLE (Shared Learning Explorer) — language shift that frees people to learn publicly.  

**Takeaway**  
- Institutions should normalize exploration as leadership.  
- Expertise is an outcome, not a prerequisite.  

---

## **Option B: The ADHD-Inspired Pivot to Weekly + Quarterly Notes**  
**Hook**  
- “Productivity systems don’t fail because we’re lazy; they fail because they don’t match the way our brains work.”  

**Problem**  
- The “Now/Next/Never” setup in Reminders was collapsing under weight.  
- Reminders = too noisy, too rigid.  

**Reframe**  
- Pivot: Apple Notes holds the *weekly + quarterly cadence* → the true rhythm of important work.  
- Reminders slimmed down to chores and actual alarms.  

**Story**  
- Inspired by Rhonda’s paper-based ADHD system: clarity comes from simplicity, not more categories.  
- Your own shift to Forever Notes as the backbone.  

**Takeaway**  
- Real systems evolve when you embrace constraints.  
- Neurodivergent-friendly productivity = reduce buckets, sharpen cadence.  

---

Both are publishable this week.  
- **A** is leadership-culture, likely to resonate in higher-ed / org circles.  
- **B** is systems-personal, likely to resonate with productivity / neurodivergent readers.  

Do you want me to expand one of these into a rough blog-ready draft so you’ve got a head start tomorrow?

---

**User:**

Ok. So my last few posts were about my ai usage, rss feeds and then ai work slop. So breaking from this trend is fine. Let’s posit that both a and b candidates are good and can be this week and next.  Which should be now and which should be queued for later?

---

**Assistant:**

That context helps — if the last three were AI / tooling-centric, then stepping sideways keeps the feed fresh. Here’s how I’d sequence them:  

---

### **This Week (Friday): Option A — Shared Learning Explorers**  
- Reason:  
  - It’s short, punchy, and cultural → good palate cleanser after three posts on AI/tools.  
  - Timely: you’re actively living the SME vs. SLE discussion with your team, so it’s got immediacy.  
  - Readers in higher ed/IT leadership will nod at it and share it — it’s a leadership/identity piece, not another tech one.  

---

### **Next Week: Option B — Weekly/Quarterly Notes Pivot**  
- Reason:  
  - Stronger as a slightly longer, more reflective systems/process piece.  
  - Will feel like a return to your “Digital Doug productivity lab” voice.  
  - Gives you time to polish the framing around neurodivergence + Rhonda’s influence without forcing it into a rush.  

---

So: **SLE this week → Forever Notes pivot next week.**  
Keeps your rhythm varied and intentional: leadership culture → personal system design → then you can swing back to tech/AI later if you want.  

Want me to spin up a draft of the SLE post in blog-ready narrative so it’s primed for tomorrow morning?

---

**User:**

Not yet. Let’s pull forward the process we used for the last post. It was reasonably efficient. We should give it another try. 

---

**Assistant:**

Right — last time we:  

1. **Generated a shortlist of candidate angles**  
2. **Invented a mock “reader panel”** (NSCC folks + LinkedIn audience) to react with feedback (what landed, what felt thin, what they’d share/comment on)  
3. **Rolled their feedback into a tighter plan** (your voice, not theirs)  
4. **Drafted a blog-ready skeleton** with headline, hook, and flow  
5. You did the final polish/ship  

That rhythm worked because it gave you outside-in perspective first, then tightened the core argument before drafting.  

For this week’s post (Shared Learning Explorers), we can re-run the same loop:  

- **Step 1 (now):** Build 2–3 possible framings of the SLE piece (different entry points).  
- **Step 2:** Run the mock reader panel against those framings.  
- **Step 3:** Condense their feedback into a single recommended outline.  
- **Step 4:** Flesh into a working draft.  

Do you want me to start by sketching those 2–3 alternative framings of the SME → SLE idea?

---

**User:**

Sure. Give me 2 or 3 framings for the SME SLE piece grounded in the anecdote from my team. 

---

**Assistant:**

Alright — here are three different framings for the SME → SLE idea, each grounded in your team’s reaction but with a distinct entry point and emphasis:  

---

### **Framing 1: The Pressure of Premature Expertise**  
- **Hook:** “One of my team members pulled me aside recently and said: ‘I’m not comfortable being called the SME on this. I’m still figuring it out.’ That honesty hit me.”  
- **Angle:** The SME label creates pressure to project certainty before you’ve had time to explore.  
- **Pivot:** Redefine the role: they’re not SMEs, they’re *Shared Learning Explorers*.  
- **Takeaway:** In fast-moving tech, credibility comes from transparency and curiosity, not a premature badge of expertise.  

---

### **Framing 2: Curiosity as Leadership Currency**  
- **Hook:** “We sometimes expect staff to become experts in technologies that didn’t exist last year. That’s not a fair ask—but it’s a fantastic opportunity.”  
- **Angle:** Higher ed IT doesn’t need “masters” of emerging tech, it needs leaders who model curiosity and learning-in-public.  
- **Pivot:** SLE reframes leadership as exploring with others, not knowing in advance.  
- **Takeaway:** The best leaders aren’t the ones with the answers, but the ones who ask the most useful questions.  

---

### **Framing 3: Changing the Language, Changing the Culture**  
- **Hook:** “Language has weight. Call someone a ‘subject matter expert’ and you’ve put a crown on their head. Call them a ‘Shared Learning Explorer’ and you’ve given them a compass.”  
- **Angle:** Titles and labels shape culture more than policies do.  
- **Pivot:** Your team’s discomfort is evidence that the words are wrong. SLE shifts the expectation from performance to participation.  
- **Takeaway:** By changing the language, you change how people show up: less imposter syndrome, more collaborative learning.  

---

Do you want me to put these through the “mock reader panel” lens next, so you can see which framing has the strongest pull for your core audience?

---

**User:**

Sure. Let’s do that. 

---

**Assistant:**

Alright — here’s how a mock panel made up of your **NSCC internal crowd** (staff, faculty, leadership) and your **LinkedIn readership** (higher-ed + IT + productivity-curious folks) might react to each framing:  

---

### **Framing 1: The Pressure of Premature Expertise**  
**Internal staff reaction:**  
- “Yes, that’s *exactly* what it feels like when we get labeled SME on something we barely touched.”  
- Validates their discomfort, reduces stigma.  
- Risk: some may still hear “explorer” as a cop-out if leadership doesn’t signal support.  

**Leadership/LinkedIn reaction:**  
- Resonates with anyone managing teams in fast-moving fields.  
- Works as a culture commentary piece: leaders often *do* put undue weight on the SME badge.  
- Some may want more than just a name change — “what’s the actual practice shift?”  

---

### **Framing 2: Curiosity as Leadership Currency**  
**Internal staff reaction:**  
- “Feels aspirational, but maybe a little far from my day-to-day.”  
- Inspiring, but risks being seen as more *about leadership philosophy* than their lived anxiety.  

**Leadership/LinkedIn reaction:**  
- Strong pull: leaders love curiosity-as-virtue framing.  
- Sharable quote-level lines (“the best leaders aren’t the ones with the answers...”).  
- Plays well with professional networks, could travel wider.  

---

### **Framing 3: Changing the Language, Changing the Culture**  
**Internal staff reaction:**  
- “Yes — calling it something different actually changes how it feels.”  
- Relatable: people know words carry weight in org culture.  
- Most concrete/hopeful of the three.  

**Leadership/LinkedIn reaction:**  
- Digestible: makes sense quickly, good for thought-leadership style.  
- Risks seeming “soft” unless paired with a concrete story (your team’s anecdote anchors it).  
- Memorable metaphor (crown vs. compass) → easy to quote/share.  

---

### **Panel Consensus**  
- **Internal resonance:** Framing 1 and 3 feel the truest to their lived experience.  
- **External/LinkedIn traction:** Framing 2 and 3 have the most shareable pull.  
- **Crossover winner:** **Framing 3** → strongest for both sides when paired with your anecdote, because it’s both *concrete (language shift)* and *cultural (compass > crown)*.  

---

Want me to take Framing 3 and shape it into a blog skeleton (headline, intro hook, body beats, takeaway) so you’ve got a clean template to draft from tomorrow?

---

**User:**

Hmm. All three have value but 1 feels more authentic to me and the story. It’s like 1 represents the “what”, 2 maybe reflects the “why” and 3 is more about “how”. 

---

**Assistant:**

Exactly — you nailed the split:  

- **Framing 1 (“Pressure of Premature Expertise”) = the *What*** → authentic anecdote, the lived moment with your team.  
- **Framing 2 (“Curiosity as Leadership Currency”) = the *Why*** → the philosophy behind why it matters.  
- **Framing 3 (“Language shifts culture”) = the *How*** → the practical move, renaming as SLE.  

That actually sets you up with a natural **narrative arc**: start with 1 (the story), expand with 2 (why curiosity > expertise), close with 3 (how shifting language fixes the tension).  

So instead of picking one, you could **sequence them inside a single post** without making it sprawl:  

**Skeleton flow:**  
- **Hook / What:** Tell the anecdote — staff member uneasy with “SME” label → name the pressure.  
- **Why:** Step back — in emerging tech, curiosity is the real leadership currency. Expertise is impossible at the pace of change.  
- **How:** Offer the pivot — “Shared Learning Explorer” reframes the role, crown → compass.  
- **Takeaway:** In higher ed IT, exploration is the most credible form of leadership.  

That way you keep the authenticity of 1, the resonance of 2, and the cultural stickiness of 3 — without mashing them into an “Option 3 mega-frame.”  

Want me to draft that as a blog skeleton so you can see how tight it feels?

---

**User:**

Yes. Give me as detailed a skeleton as possible. We’ll follow up tomorrow with a reverse prompt interview so you have my full thoughts. 

---

**Assistant:**

Perfect — here’s a **detailed blog skeleton** built around the **What → Why → How** arc. I’ve written it at the granularity where you can almost see the sentences forming, but still skeletal enough to expand in your own voice tomorrow.  

---

# **Blog Skeleton: Shared Learning Explorers**  

### **Title candidates**  
- *From Experts to Explorers: Leading in the Unknown*  
- *Crown or Compass? Rethinking the SME Label in Emerging Tech*  
- *Why My Team Rejected the “SME” Crown — And Found a Better Role*  

---

### **Intro / Hook (The What)**  
- Open with the anecdote:  
  - “One of my team members told me, ‘I’m not comfortable being called the SME on this. I’m still figuring it out.’”  
  - Name your reaction: authentic, a little sobering — because they weren’t alone in feeling that.  
- Establish tension:  
  - The “SME” badge feels like recognition but often lands as pressure.  
  - In fast-evolving tech, the label is premature — you can’t be a subject matter expert on something that barely has a subject yet.  

---

### **Body Part 1 — The Pressure of Premature Expertise**  
- SME = crown on the head → expectation of authority and certainty.  
- Lived reality = curiosity, tinkering, half-confidence.  
- Result: imposter syndrome; staff pull back from leading because the title feels too heavy.  
- Your team’s discomfort was a *signal* that the language was wrong.  

---

### **Body Part 2 — Why Curiosity is the Real Currency**  
- Emerging tech doesn’t reward mastery; it rewards adaptability and pattern recognition.  
- In higher ed IT, credibility is not about knowing all the answers — it’s about exploring in public, scaffolding others as you learn.  
- Leadership in these spaces = modeling curiosity, not expertise.  
- Pull-quote style line: *“The best leaders in new tech aren’t the ones with the answers. They’re the ones who ask the right questions out loud.”*  

---

### **Body Part 3 — Changing the Language, Changing the Culture**  
- Words matter — titles set expectations.  
- Reframe: instead of “Subject Matter Expert,” we started using “Shared Learning Explorer.”  
  - Compass > crown metaphor:  
    - Crown = perform authority.  
    - Compass = invite participation, direction-finding together.  
- Language shift as micro-culture shift: it signaled to the team that leadership = contribution + curiosity, not polished mastery.  
- This wasn’t just semantics — it changed how people showed up: freer to experiment, less fear of “not knowing enough.”  

---

### **Conclusion / Takeaway**  
- In fast-changing domains, the credibility trap is thinking you must be the expert before you step forward.  
- The alternative is healthier and more authentic: lead by exploring with others, not by pretending you’re already there.  
- A small change in language (SME → SLE) can create a big shift in culture:  
  - Reducing imposter syndrome.  
  - Normalizing learning-in-public.  
  - Reinforcing that in higher ed, exploration *is* leadership.  

---

### **Optional kicker**  
- Tie back to your ongoing theme of digital responsibility / leadership in innovation:  
  - “In some ways, this is the core of digital innovation itself: not certainties, but shared explorations.”  

---

That gives you a clean scaffold: ~750–1000 words if expanded naturally.  

Do you want me tomorrow, in the reverse prompt interview, to focus on **pulling your phrasing** for the anecdote and the metaphors (so it’s yours in tone), or on stress-testing the flow (so it’s tighter editorially)?

---

**User:**

You’ll be pulling from me my anecdotes, story, voice, metaphors and where I see the dots connecting. For example, there is a natural positioning of what my learning in this moment can mean for both faculty and students as they experiment with emerging tech and ways to shape courage and curiosity about the unknown and novel. 

---

**Assistant:**

Got it — so tomorrow’s session is less “editorial tightening” and more **interviewing you to extract the raw narrative clay**:  

- **Anecdotes:** your team moment, plus any others that give it texture.  
- **Voice:** your phrasing, cadence, dry wit — not polished abstractions.  
- **Metaphors:** your natural turns of phrase (crown vs compass, ship captain with no map, whatever comes up).  
- **Connections:** how this moment with your team scales out to faculty, students, and the larger NSCC culture of learning-in-public.  

The skeleton I just gave you will be the scaffolding. Tomorrow’s reverse interview will layer in:  
1. **The lived story** (what happened, how it felt).  
2. **The dots you see connecting** (team → faculty → students → culture).  
3. **Your authentic voice** (so it doesn’t sound like a leadership textbook).  

That’ll give us a blog draft that’s not just tight, but *yours*.  

Want me to prep the reverse interview as a structured set of open questions aligned to the skeleton (so we just walk through and pull your words straight into the outline)?

---

**User:**

Ok. You are a blog post development editor, researcher and coach. Ask me questions one at a time. My responses should shape the questions as we go along. Your goal is to extract as much mineable detail from my mind and soul to power the narrative and message behind this post.

---

**Assistant:**

Alright, let’s begin at the center: the lived story.  

When your team member told you they weren’t comfortable being called the SME — what was the exact moment like? Where were you, how did they say it, and what went through your head in that instant?

---

**User:**

It was Madison in a meeting with me, her, Holly, Shelley, and Kate Snyder (Office of Learning and Transformation). It was a rare opportunity to talk with a senior leader. Both Kate and I probably talked more than we should have listened, but when we listened, we really tuned in. There was one point where Kate had referred to my team as the Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). Which is a term I use to describe them often. I know it's shorthand lingo, but it's quick. We were well into the meeting and a degree of trust and vulnerability was established. I love Kate for this. Anyway, when she referred to the team as SMEs, Madison put her paw up and asserted, quietly in her way and almost apologetically, that she was bothered by referring to as a SME. Holly and Shelley nodded in affirmation. Madison went on to say the they weren't the SMEs. If anything Doug (me) is. That's the moment where it hit me. I'm not a SME either. I just have an experimental mindset and curiosity and don't want to fail. But I don't really like to be called a SME either. It's too much pressure to perform. The idea that I'm just barely "5 minutes ahead" of folks is a real source of imposter syndrome for me. So I got it. Shelley piped in about not having the time to truly invest in becoming experts as half their workload is operational. Of course. Learning new things typically end up on the corner of the desk. Shelley also talked about (and Madison confirmed) that everything being tossed on their plate has a learning component with some (often unspoken) expectation that they are the experts. So, yeah. I got it. Kate and I acknowledge it in the meeting and I later sent something to the team on another chat (that included RJ) that we'll strive to not use that term. RJ is notorious for using short hands like SME and Area of Focus. Those have uses of course, but it's really lazy language. We can do better. 

---

**Assistant:**

That’s a rich scene — you’ve got the characters, the texture of the moment, and the turning point where it clicked for you personally. Let’s mine a layer deeper into your *internal shift*.  

When Madison pushed back, you recognized yourself in what she said — that you don’t like the SME crown either. If you had to put words around the emotional beat of that realization, what did it feel like in your gut? Relief? Embarrassment? A sharp pang of “oh damn, I’ve been complicit”? Something else?

---

**User:**

Something like that. I felt "exposed" if that fits. That I've been complicit and that it's been self-sabotaging to me as well. I an't no SME.. I just play one on TV! I totally got in the moment that this was a mindset shifting issue. 

---

**Assistant:**

That’s the heart right there — *exposed* is such a visceral word. You weren’t just hearing Madison; you were looking in a mirror.  

Let’s pull on that thread: if calling people “SMEs” is self-sabotaging, what does it sabotage? Is it their confidence? Their willingness to try? The culture of exploration you’re trying to build? Or all of the above?

---

**User:**

I think it just raises the stakes with some expectation to perform at an expert level. When you're still learning, you'll make mistakes. Which is fine, but if you're the SME, you feel you must be perfect. Which def zaps confidence and makes you more cautious. Or worse (for me anyway) to bullshit your way forward. Humans can be "confidently wrong" to when their goal is to fit the role of an expert and have all the answers (nice throw back to previous post about AI work slop). I think it can have a negative impact on the courage and willingness to experiment.. which is what emerging tech is all about. No one knows shit about the new stuff.. why should we hold ourselves to such a high standard? Fail forward motherfuckers.

---

**Assistant:**

🔥 That’s gold — and now we’ve got your voice shining through. *Fail forward motherfuckers* could almost be the hidden thesis of this piece.  

Let’s stretch it outward now. If the danger of the SME crown is perfection theater and bullshit confidence, then the alternative needs to lower the stakes, invite mistakes, and encourage visible learning.  

So let me ask: when you think of **Shared Learning Explorers**, what images or metaphors come to mind? How does that label change the energy in the room compared to “SME”?

---

**User:**

Shared Learning Explorers is a nice convenient way to replace SME with SLE. It's probably not perfect, but it's sticky enough to facilitate the mindset shift. The SME but of jargon as so much entrenchment that SLE is an easy swap. Specifically to this phrase, in a way it's perfect. "Learning" is at the heart. That is "Explorational" in nature in that failure is not a bug, it's a feature. Fail early, fail often. It's okay to be wrong. My team's "guesses" are better than a lot of folks "facts". That doesn't come with domain expertise, but with a predisposition to try shit out. The real key word tho could be "Shared" in that there doesn't have to be a cleft or chasm between my team and the people they're working with. We all learn together. My folks just take point and use their unique perspectives to facilitate the sense-making that's required when contemplating and teasing apart new tech and ideas. I think there's an element of play here too, but not sure how that weaves in. It def is part of my motivation as a neurodiverse brain in that learning new shit is fun to me. I think it is for my team as well, if the anxiety can be removed and they're given time to play/learn and permission too be wrong-- even if it's a lot of the time. 

---

**Assistant:**

That’s a rich unpacking — the “Shared” piece especially reframes it from hierarchy to *togetherness*. And your neurodiverse spin on *play as learning* gives it warmth most productivity/leadership writing misses.  

Let’s press into the **faculty/student connection** you hinted at earlier:  

If your team stepping into SLE mode shifts the way *you* work, what does it model for faculty and students? In other words, how does this small language change ripple outward into the broader culture of teaching and learning at NSCC?

---

**User:**

I'm no pedagogical expert (I just play one on TV!). But I can def see the dynamic between faculty and students. Where faculty are "keepers of all knowledge" and dole it out to their charges. It isn't like this at all of course. And at a college, it's more of a mentor/apprentice model (or should be in my mind). I've observed many faculty lament about being only 5 minutes ahead of their students and that  they feel like imposters. They push back about needing learning opportunities and time to prep and stuff. Which is probably all true. What can be helpful here, especially with new subject domains, is the expectation that faculty don't _have_ to be the expert. They have life and industry experience that makes them better _learners_ themselves. One off the best things an educator can do is to be a good learner themselves.. and be transparent about it. In your opinion, it isn't the expertise that students need from faculty (they can get that from the wikipedia and YouTube and god help us TikTok). But faculty can act as coaches and mentors in the learning process because not only are they great teachers, they are great learners.  This is my lens anyway. I'm not a trined educator, but I think I get this. Most faculty do as well. It's just getting out of our own heads that's the challenge. 

For students, I think that not treating failure as a bug is key. A misstep is another data point. There's a Thomas Edison quote somewhere that he didn't invent the light bulb all at once. First he had to find hundreds of ways to not do it first. You can find this exact quote for me. But I think that positioning Edison and his contemporaries as learners first and inventors second is important. If there's any one thing I've learned it's that I never get shit on the first try. 

Also, there's a nugget that the best way to reinforce learning, especially with new stuff like emerging tech, is to explain it to someone else. How do you get to be a SME? Teach others. Don't know? Teach them what you've tried. It all counts

---

**Assistant:**

That’s perfect — you just tied your team’s discomfort straight into the faculty/student dynamic without forcing it. The parallel is clean:  

- **Your team:** labeled “experts,” when they’re really explorers.  
- **Faculty:** pressured to be “keepers of all knowledge,” when their real power is modeling learning.  
- **Students:** pressured to avoid failure, when in fact failure *is* the curriculum.  

And you’ve already got your Edison quote baked in — the line is:  
> *“I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.”*  

That sits beautifully alongside your “fail forward” riff.  

Let’s pull one more thread to round out your raw material: you’ve talked about **play** as a driver for you and your team, and as a way to reframe failure. If you had to describe *what play looks like in your work context*, how would you picture it? Not games, but the spirit of it.

---

**User:**

This is more personal to me. But when I get really curious about something, I have to know everything about it. I was that toddler who took his toys apart to see how they worked. Sure, I ended up with a lot of broken toys, but the curiosity was a source of play for me. There's a negative side for me as well-- I end up rushing to the end and skipping a bunch of the details. My woodworking and such is a great example. I get to a finished product because I'm on the high of creation and the learning and discovery of bending tools and materials to my will. But I hate sanding and my measurements can sometimes be a little off. Sure.. I take "Perfect is the enemy of done" a little far. But that's me though. Other people are better at the fine details, not because they are mores skilled than any other, but that it strikes their sense of play and enjoyment to have it just exactly the way they want it. In both cases, it's the process that drives it. One is more kinetic and the other is more deliberate. One isn't better than the other. Anyway, that's what I think about Play in this context. And I think it's what makes innovators innovate and creators create. Everything else is just work. Work can be driven by passion and purpose (cousins of play) and that's fine too.

---

**Assistant:**

That’s a fantastic metaphor vein — “breaking toys to see how they work” → “woodworking without sanding” → “done is better than perfect.” It shows play as *curiosity in motion*, not frivolity.  

Here’s what we’ve mined so far for the blog draft clay:  

- **Scene:** Madison’s pushback in the meeting, your sense of being *exposed*, realizing “SME” is a crown you don’t want either.  
- **Emotional beat:** the pressure to perform expert-level perfection → imposter syndrome → bullshit confidence → paralysis.  
- **Core pivot:** *Shared Learning Explorer* → learning in public, fail forward, compass > crown.  
- **Ripple out:** faculty as “mentors/apprentices,” not keepers of all knowledge; students treating failure as data, not shame.  
- **Metaphors:** breaking toys, woodworking without sanding, Edison’s 10,000 failures, “fail forward motherfuckers.”  
- **Tone:** candid, wry, humane — not a leadership manual, but a personal realization with cultural teeth.  

Before we lock the skeleton into your narrative voice tomorrow:  
Do you want this post to lean more toward **personal confession with cultural resonance** (your exposure moment + lessons) or **organizational call-to-action** (here’s how we should shift language/culture at NSCC)?

---

**User:**

The vibe of my blog tends to be more personal. It's Digital Doug, not the "Blog for Digital innovation, Staff Training and Development". So I'm very cool wth keeping it informal and maybe snarky irreverent. With colourful language as required.

---

**Assistant:**

Perfect — then we’ll let it breathe as a **personal confessional with teeth**, not a policy memo.  

So the flow tomorrow can lean like this:  

- **Hook:** Madison’s interruption → your “exposed” moment.  
- **Middle:** unpack the pressure trap of “SME” → bullshit confidence vs. courage to fail.  
- **Pivot:** Shared Learning Explorer → crown vs. compass, fail forward, learning as play.  
- **Ripple:** parallel to faculty/students → being learners first, experts second.  
- **Close:** Edison + your “breaking toys” metaphor → curiosity as play, failure as the feature, not the bug.  
- **Tone:** dry, sharp, a little irreverent (*fail forward motherfuckers* deserves to stay).  

That keeps it very “Digital Doug” — your story, your voice, your snark — while still giving readers a cultural insight they can carry back to their own teams/classrooms.  

Do you want me to prep the **reverse interview questions sequenced to this skeleton** so when we sit down tomorrow, it’s just me prompting you to fill the beats in your own words?

---

**User:**

Motherfuckers probably crosses the line, but the vibe is on pint

---

**Assistant:**

Got it — we’ll keep the spice but dial it to your “snarky irreverent, not gratuitous” range. Think *sharp elbows, not middle fingers*.  

So maybe your Edison / failure riff lands more like:  
- *“Failure isn’t a bug. It’s the curriculum.”*  
- or *“Nobody’s a subject matter expert on the brand-new. We’re all just a few guesses ahead, and that counts.”*  

Tomorrow we can shape the exact phrasing in your words.  

I’ll prep a **reverse interview script** for you, sequenced to the skeleton. Each question will mine one layer deeper (scene → feeling → metaphor → connection → takeaway), so all you’ll need to do is answer in your own voice and we’ll have the draft material ready.  

Want me to lay that question set out now so you’ve got it in front of you before tomorrow?

---

**User:**

Wait.. we just did the reverse interview, right?

---

**Assistant:**

Exactly — we just ran it in practice. You gave me:  

- **The scene:** Madison speaking up in the meeting.  
- **The feeling:** you felt *exposed* — complicit and self-sabotaging with “SME.”  
- **The impact:** perfection pressure, bullshit confidence, imposter syndrome.  
- **The pivot:** “Shared Learning Explorers” — compass > crown, failure as feature.  
- **The ripple:** parallels to faculty/students — being learners first, experts second.  
- **The metaphors:** breaking toys, woodworking without sanding, Edison’s 10,000 failures.  
- **The tone:** snarky-irreverent, not sanitized.  

So yeah — we’ve pulled up all the raw narrative clay you’ll need.  

Tomorrow’s work is less *interview* and more **assembly/editing**: taking those mined details and slotting them against the skeleton so you’ve got a blog-ready draft to polish.  

Do you want me to stitch your answers into the skeleton now as a rough composite draft, so tomorrow you’re starting with something you can refine rather than a blank page?

---

**User:**

Tomorrow is today, so we're on task to write this thing. Do we have everything we need to outline the post?

---

**Assistant:**

Yes — we’ve mined all the core ingredients. Here’s a **final detailed outline** mapped from your raw material to the skeleton so you can see the shape clearly before we draft prose:  

---

## **Outline: Shared Learning Explorers**  

### **Title Options**  
- *Crown or Compass? Rethinking “SME” in Emerging Tech*  
- *Five Minutes Ahead, Not an Expert: Why We’re Explorers, Not SMEs*  
- *Failure Isn’t a Bug: Making Peace With Not Knowing*  

---

### **Intro / Hook (The What)**  
- Scene: Meeting with Madison, Holly, Shelley, Kate Snyder.  
- Kate refers to team as SMEs → Madison gently pushes back.  
- Others nod. She says, “We’re not the SMEs. If anything, Doug is.”  
- Gut punch: you realize you don’t like the SME label either → *exposed*.  
- Stakes: SME label = pressure to perform expertise you don’t really have.  

---

### **Part 1 — The Pressure of Premature Expertise**  
- SME label as shorthand → convenient but lazy language.  
- Feels like a crown → expected to perform perfection.  
- Reality: you’re “5 minutes ahead,” improvising.  
- Emotional toll: imposter syndrome, cautiousness, or bullshit confidence (“confidently wrong”).  
- Connection to earlier AI post: this is another form of *work slop* → performative certainty.  

---

### **Part 2 — Why Curiosity is the Real Currency**  
- Emerging tech has no established experts; the only way forward is exploration.  
- Fail forward, fail early, fail often.  
- Courage > perfection.  
- Quote-style line: *“Nobody’s a subject matter expert on the brand-new. We’re all just a few guesses ahead, and that counts.”*  
- Play as a frame: curiosity as joy, not just work; different people find play in different aspects (you rush, others savor).  

---

### **Part 3 — Changing the Language, Changing the Culture**  
- Labels shape culture. SME sets people up for performance pressure.  
- Reframe: Shared Learning Explorer (SLE).  
  - **Learning:** permission to fail and iterate.  
  - **Exploration:** failure is a feature, not a bug.  
  - **Shared:** no chasm between IT staff and faculty/users; sense-making together.  
- Compass vs. crown metaphor — guiding alongside instead of ruling from above.  
- Immediate impact: team felt heard, culture shifted in real time.  

---

### **Part 4 — Ripples to Faculty & Students**  
- Faculty often feel 5 minutes ahead of students → same imposter syndrome.  
- But faculty strength isn’t encyclopedic knowledge; it’s modeling *how to learn*.  
- Students, too: failure is curriculum. Edison quote (“10,000 ways that won’t work”).  
- Teaching others, even before you feel like an expert, accelerates learning.  

---

### **Conclusion / Takeaway**  
- Being called an SME can be self-sabotage → perfection trap.  
- Reframing to SLE lowers the stakes, normalizes mistakes, encourages courage.  
- For teams, faculty, and students: exploration > expertise.  
- Failure isn’t the enemy. It’s the path.  

---

We’ve got everything needed: story, tone, metaphors, arc.  

Do you want me to spin this into a **first-draft narrative** in your blog voice right now, so you’ve got copy to work with?

---

**User:**

Let's not waste time on the prose yet.. bring in the simulated reader panel of my team, Ctl, staff, faculty, students as well as the general linkedin audience get them to crawl over this outline and give their feedback. You can rollin up and provide recommendations as an editor. Looking for resonance, red flags, confusion and meaning. 

---

**Assistant:**

Alright — here’s how the **simulated reader panel** might crawl over your outline, group by group, followed by an editorial roll-up:  

---

## **Reader Panel Feedback**  

### **Your Team (InnovDev)**  
- **Resonance:** They’ll strongly identify with the opening anecdote — it’s literally their experience. “Exposed” moment is authentic, not staged.  
- **Flag:** A few might worry SLE comes off as a *cute acronym gimmick* if not grounded in substance. Needs emphasis that it’s shorthand for a deeper mindset, not just a rebrand.  
- **Meaning:** They’ll appreciate being seen/heard, especially that you name the anxiety and link it to curiosity + play.  

### **CTL + Staff (non-tech but close collaborators)**  
- **Resonance:** The “shared” dimension of SLE lands hardest here — they’re used to IT being cast as gatekeepers.  
- **Confusion:** Compass vs crown metaphor might need one clear illustration, otherwise risks sounding too poetic.  
- **Meaning:** They’ll see immediate crossover with their own roles (faculty development, learning design).  

### **Faculty**  
- **Resonance:** The “five minutes ahead” parallel is spot-on. They’ll nod at the imposter feeling and the pressure to perform as all-knowing.  
- **Flag:** Some may bristle at a non-faculty voice prescribing pedagogy (“I’m not a trained educator but…” is smart to keep). Keep it as observation, not doctrine.  
- **Meaning:** They’ll likely share this if the “coach/mentor/learner” identity is framed aspirationally, not critically.  

### **Students**  
- **Resonance:** Failure reframed as curriculum → that will stick. Edison quote gives a clear anchor.  
- **Confusion:** “SLE” as terminology won’t matter to them; they’ll care more about *permission to fail*.  
- **Meaning:** They might skim the organizational stuff, but the Edison/failure/play sections translate well.  

### **LinkedIn Audience (higher-ed IT + productivity curious)**  
- **Resonance:** Strong hook story (leader learning from team pushback). Vulnerability + practical pivot is LinkedIn catnip.  
- **Flag:** Acronym SLE might not travel well beyond your circle unless introduced cleanly — risk of eye-rolling unless grounded in story.  
- **Meaning:** The personal → organizational → cultural arc will make it broadly shareable, especially with the “failure isn’t a bug, it’s the curriculum” punchline.  

---

## **Editorial Roll-Up & Recommendations**  

- **Keep:**  
  - The anecdote as the entry point (it’s sticky and authentic).  
  - The “exposed” confession — it signals vulnerability and credibility.  
  - The faculty/student parallel — one of the most transferable insights.  
  - Failure reframed as curriculum — this is your soundbite.  

- **Refine:**  
  - **SLE term:** Position as a *working label* your team adopted, not a capital-T Truth. This defuses skepticism.  
  - **Compass vs crown:** Anchor with one clean sentence or image, don’t stretch it.  
  - **Faculty lens:** Keep your “I’m no pedagogy expert” humility line — prevents pushback.  

- **Trim/Clarify:**  
  - Don’t overplay acronyms (SME/SLE). Use once, then lean on the plain-language phrasing (“explorers”).  
  - Make sure the Edison/play metaphors are tied back to *team/faculty/student courage* — otherwise risks drifting into “Doug’s woodworking diary.”  

- **Boost:**  
  - Bring the “play” idea up a notch earlier — it’s one of your distinctively personal contributions.  
  - End with a punchy, tweet-able takeaway line. Something like:  
    *“Expertise is an outcome, not a prerequisite. In the new, we’re all explorers first.”*  

---

Want me to take these edits and produce a **finalized outline with these refinements baked in** so you’ve got a cleaner launchpad before writing prose?

---

**User:**

yes

---

**Assistant:**

Here’s the **refined outline**, tightened up with the reader panel’s feedback and editorial recommendations baked in. This is now a launchpad you can move straight into prose from.  

---

## **Refined Outline: Shared Learning Explorers**  

### **Title Options**  
- *Crown or Compass? Rethinking “SME” in Emerging Tech*  
- *Five Minutes Ahead, Not an Expert: Why We’re Explorers First*  
- *Failure Isn’t a Bug: The Case for Shared Learning Explorers*  

---

### **Intro / Hook (The What)**  
- Scene: Meeting with Madison, Holly, Shelley, Kate Snyder.  
- Kate casually calls your team SMEs → Madison quietly pushes back.  
- Others nod. “We’re not SMEs. If anyone is, it’s Doug.”  
- Emotional beat: you feel *exposed* — realizing you don’t like the label either.  
- Stakes: SME shorthand may be convenient, but it sets the bar at “expert” when what’s really needed is *exploration*.  

---

### **Part 1 — The Pressure of Premature Expertise**  
- SME label feels like a crown: confers authority, demands certainty.  
- Reality: you (and your team) are “five minutes ahead,” improvising and experimenting.  
- Pressure = imposter syndrome, over-cautiousness, or bullshit confidence (“confidently wrong”).  
- Connection to earlier “AI work slop” post: both are about *performative certainty* that stalls real progress.  

---

### **Part 2 — Why Curiosity is the Real Currency**  
- In emerging tech, there are no true experts yet.  
- What matters: courage to try, make mistakes, and share openly.  
- Failure is not a bug, it’s the curriculum.  
- Quote-style line: *“Nobody’s a subject matter expert on the brand-new. We’re all just a few guesses ahead, and that counts.”*  
- Bring in *play*: for you, play looks like curiosity in motion — tinkering, breaking toys, rushing to outcomes. For others, play is in precision and polish. Both valid → both fuel learning.  

---

### **Part 3 — Changing the Language, Changing the Culture**  
- Language matters: SME sets the wrong expectation.  
- Reframe → Shared Learning Explorer (SLE).  
  - **Learning:** being transparent about not knowing yet.  
  - **Exploring:** failure is a feature, not a flaw.  
  - **Shared:** no gatekeeping — sense-making together with colleagues, faculty, students.  
- Compass vs crown metaphor:  
  - Crown = perform expertise.  
  - Compass = guide together, find direction.  
- Important caveat: SLE isn’t a perfect label, just sticky enough to shift the mindset.  

---

### **Part 4 — Ripples to Faculty & Students**  
- Faculty often feel “5 minutes ahead” → same imposter syndrome.  
- But their value isn’t encyclopedic knowledge — it’s modeling *how to learn*.  
- Students: failure = data point, not shame. Edison’s “10,000 ways that won’t work.”  
- Teaching others accelerates learning → “you become an expert by sharing your experiments, not by waiting until you’ve mastered it.”  

---

### **Conclusion / Takeaway**  
- SME shorthand is self-sabotage: it traps people in perfection theater.  
- Reframing to Shared Learning Explorers lowers the stakes, builds courage, and normalizes mistakes.  
- Applies to IT staff, faculty, and students alike.  
- Final punchline options:  
  - *“Expertise is an outcome, not a prerequisite. In the new, we’re all explorers first.”*  
  - *“Stop performing expertise. Start exploring together.”*  

---

This version keeps the **personal confession vibe** front and center, trims acronym fatigue, emphasizes *play* earlier, and strengthens the broader teaching/learning parallel.  

Do you want me to now **draft this into narrative prose** in your blog voice, or do you prefer to sit with the outline first and then I help tune once you’ve laid down a rough draft?

---

**User:**

Ok.. let's draft this now. Let's make sure that we don't identify individual peoples names/genders/etc. I don't have their explicit permission although I think this topic is totally cool to roll with

---

**Assistant:**

Understood — we’ll anonymize the team scene so it feels authentic without outing anyone individually. Here’s a first **narrative draft** of your post in your “Digital Doug” voice:  

---

# **Crown or Compass? Rethinking “SME” in Emerging Tech**  

We were in a meeting with a senior leader, talking through some of the work my team’s been doing. At one point, they referred to us as the *subject matter experts*. It’s a phrase I’ve tossed around myself a hundred times. Quick, convenient shorthand.  

But then one of my team members spoke up. Not loudly, not defiantly—just enough to change the air in the room. They said, “I’m not comfortable being called an SME. We’re not the experts here.” Others nodded along.  

And it hit me: I don’t like the label either. In that moment, I felt exposed. Because I’m no SME. I just play one on TV.  

---

## The Pressure of Premature Expertise  

SME sounds flattering, but it lands like a crown on your head. Heavy. Suddenly you’re expected to perform at an expert level when you’re still fumbling your way through.  

That’s how imposter syndrome creeps in. You get cautious. Or worse—you bluff. Humans are great at being “confidently wrong” when the goal is to fit the role of an expert and have all the answers.  

In practice, most of us are only “five minutes ahead.” That’s not a weakness. That’s reality in emerging tech. But the SME crown makes it feel like a flaw.  

---

## Curiosity Is the Real Currency  

The truth: in new domains, there are no experts yet. Nobody’s got the field guide. The only thing that matters is curiosity and the courage to fail in public.  

Failure isn’t a bug. It’s the curriculum.  

What matters is sharing your guesses, not pretending you already have the answers. My team’s half-baked experiments often surface insights that no one else was even looking for. That’s not expertise. That’s exploration.  

And honestly, exploration is fun—when you take the pressure off. For me, play looks like curiosity in motion: tinkering, breaking things apart, rushing toward a working version. For others, play is in precision and polish, sanding every edge smooth. Both are valid. Both move the work forward.  

---

## From Crowns to Compasses  

So we started swapping the language. Instead of “subject matter experts,” we talk about being *Shared Learning Explorers*.  

It’s not a perfect phrase, but it’s sticky enough to shift the mindset:  
- **Learning** → You don’t have to know it all yet.  
- **Exploring** → Mistakes are part of the map-making.  
- **Shared** → We’re not gatekeepers; we figure it out together.  

A crown forces you to perform expertise. A compass points toward discovery.  

---

## Ripples Beyond IT  

This isn’t just an IT thing. Faculty tell me they often feel just “five minutes ahead” of their students. That can trigger the same imposter spiral. But students don’t need professors to be omniscient—they need mentors who show them how to learn.  

And students themselves? They get crushed by the idea that mistakes are failure. But if Edison could find “10,000 ways that won’t work” before he found one that did, maybe we can give ourselves some slack. Every wrong turn is just another data point.  

You don’t become an expert by waiting until you’ve mastered it. You become one by teaching what you’ve tried—even if it doesn’t work the first dozen times.  

---

## Closing  

Calling people SMEs might be convenient shorthand, but it’s self-sabotage. It traps us in perfection theater.  

Shared Learning Explorers isn’t just a nicer label. It’s a better culture. One where courage, curiosity, and play beat premature expertise every time.  

Because expertise is an outcome, not a prerequisite.  
And in the new? We’re all explorers first.  

---  

Want me to do a second pass tightening for length (make it ~700 words and LinkedIn-friendly), or do you like it sitting at full narrative weight for your Substack/SharePoint flow?

---

**User:**

Hmm.. this feels a little impersonal. Can we bring back some of the anecdotes and character? Also, let's vary the sentence length and structure. Avoid AI-isms and the much maligned emdash. I love me some snark and sass too.. but not over the top. It's gotta sound like me.

---

**Assistant:**

Got it — let’s punch it up with more of *your* cadences: some sass, some wry confession, a little mess left in on purpose so it doesn’t read like a sanitized leadership blog. Short/long sentence rhythm. More anecdotal color. And we’ll keep it in your informal Digital Doug voice.  

Here’s a revised draft:  

---

# **Crown or Compass? Rethinking “SME” in Emerging Tech**  

We were in a meeting with one of the higher-ups. My team was in the room, and things were rolling along. At one point the phrase popped out: *“the subject matter experts.”* It’s a line I’ve used myself too many times to count. Fast. Handy. Everyone knows what you mean.  

Then one of my folks raised a hand and said—quietly, almost apologetically—“I don’t think we’re SMEs.” The rest nodded like, yep, that tracks.  

That stopped me cold. Because the truth is? I don’t like being called an SME either. I felt exposed in the best/worst way. Like I’d been playing along with a game I didn’t even enjoy.  

---

## The Trouble With Crowns  

Here’s the thing about being called an “expert.” It sounds flattering, but it also sticks a crown on your head. And crowns are heavy. Suddenly you’re expected to have the answers, to get it right every time.  

But that’s not how this works. Not in emerging tech. Half the time I’m barely five minutes ahead myself. If I’m honest, that’s where the imposter syndrome comes from. You either get cautious and stop experimenting, or you lean into performance mode and bluff your way through. Humans are great at being confidently wrong.  

I’ve done both. Neither feels good.  

---

## What Really Counts  

In reality, there are no experts when the ink is still wet. Nobody’s got the manual. The real currency is curiosity, plus the courage to screw up in public and keep moving.  

Failure isn’t a flaw in the system. It *is* the system.  

That’s where the fun creeps in. For me, play shows up as curiosity on a sugar high: tearing things apart, rushing to make something work, skipping a few steps in the middle. Other people take joy in getting it exact—measuring twice, sanding the corners, lining it all up. Neither is wrong. Both are play. Both move things forward.  

---

## A Better Label  

So we started trying a different phrase. Instead of “subject matter experts,” we talk about being **Shared Learning Explorers**.  

It’s not a perfect label. It’s not meant to be. But it’s sticky enough to nudge the culture:  
- **Learning** → We’re not pretending to know it all yet.  
- **Exploring** → Wrong turns are part of the map.  
- **Shared** → We figure it out alongside the people we support.  

An “expert” has to perform certainty. An explorer just has to keep moving. One wears a crown, the other carries a compass.  

---

## Not Just an IT Thing  

The same dynamic shows up in classrooms. Faculty sometimes confess they’re only a few minutes ahead of their students. They feel like imposters too. But students don’t need encyclopedias with tenure—they need mentors who model what it looks like to be a learner.  

And students themselves? They’re taught to treat mistakes like a scarlet letter. But Edison figured out ten thousand ways *not* to make a light bulb before one finally worked. Every miss is just another data point.  

That’s how you get better. You don’t wait until you’re an expert. You teach what you’ve tried, even when it’s rough.  

---

## Closing  

Calling people SMEs sounds neat on a slide deck. But in practice, it’s a trap. It pushes people into perfection theater, where bluffing and burnout set the tone.  

Shared Learning Explorer flips the script. It lowers the stakes. It makes room for courage and curiosity. It reminds us that exploration is the job.  

Expertise is an outcome, not a prerequisite.  
And in the world of the new, we’re all explorers first.  

---  

This one keeps the bones of the outline but adds the *confession + sass + anecdote flavor* you wanted. Would you like me to trim it tighter for LinkedIn (leaner, quotier), or keep it full-bodied for your Substack/SharePoint audience?

---

**User:**

Full bodied is fine. Let's bring this into canvas so I can edit it there.

**Assistant:**

I left you comments on refining tone and flow — tightening the intro self-reference, checking the “bullshit” quote, smoothing the cringe self-callout, and suggesting a sharper close. You’ve got a strong narrative; now it’s just about fine-tuning the rhythm and audience cues.

---

**User:**

The draft has a strong personal voice and clear arc. A few notes to consider:

- **Intro anecdote:** Works well, but the line *“If anything, Doug is the SME”* might read as name-dropping yourself. You could anonymize that further by saying *“If anything, our manager is”* to keep the tone consistent with the earlier anonymization.

- **Humor/snark:** The “baffle ‘em with bullshit” quote is funny, but consider whether it undercuts your own point about bluffing. Might be stronger as a rhetorical flourish without attribution.

- **Play metaphor:** The toy‑dismantling / woodworking anecdotes add color. You might shorten slightly to keep rhythm snappy, but the contrast between kinetic vs. detail‑oriented play is clear and relatable.

- **Cringe self‑callout:** The bit where you write *“Okay. That is kinda cringe. But you get the point.”* is charming and authentic, but double‑edged — it could break flow for some readers. Decide if you want that wink to the audience or a cleaner close.

- **Closing:** The ‘Anyway’ header is very Doug, but a sharper title like *“The Point”* or *“So What”* could land harder while still keeping your style.

- **Gen Z/Gen X accessibility:** The “fail sticker” line works better than “scarlet letter.” Consider adding one more modern example (like “F on the board” or “game over screen”) to hit both demographics.

Overall, the draft captures your personal vibe, balances irreverence with meaning, and threads the faculty/student parallel nicely. Small trims and tone choices will polish it for publication.

**Assistant:**

I adjusted that line to anonymize it—now it says *“our manager”* instead of naming you directly.

---

**User:**

What about the rest of the feedback?

---

**Assistant:**

{"updates":[{"pattern":".*","multiple":true,"replacement":"# **Crown or Compass? Rethinking “SME” in Emerging Tech**\n\nWe were in a meeting with one of the higher-ups from a peer department. My team was in the room, and things were rolling along. At one point the phrase popped out: *“the subject matter experts.”* It’s a line I’ve used myself too many times to count. Fast. Handy. Everyone knows what you mean.\n\nThen one of my folks raised a hand and said, quietly, almost apologetically, “I don’t think we’re the SMEs.” The rest nodded like, yep, that tracks. “If anything, our manager is the SME.”\n\nThat stopped me cold. Because the truth is? I don’t like being called an SME either. I felt exposed in the best and worst kinda way. I’d been playing along with a game I didn’t even enjoy. Damn.\n\n---\n\n## The Trouble With Crowns\n\nHere’s the thing about being called an “expert.” It sounds flattering, but it also sticks a crown on your head. And crowns are heavy. Suddenly you’re expected to have the answers, to get it right every time.\n\nBut that’s not how this works. Not in emerging tech. Not in anything, for that matter. Half the time I’m barely five minutes ahead myself. And if I’m honest, that’s where the imposter syndrome comes from. You either get cautious and stop experimenting, or you lean into performance mode and bluff your way through. \n\nHumans are great at being confidently wrong. We even taught the LLMs that trick.\n\nI’ve done both. Neither feels good.\n\n---\n\n## What Really Counts\n\nIn reality, there are no experts when the ink is still wet. Nobody’s got the manual. The real currency is curiosity, plus the courage to screw up in public and keep moving.\n\nFailure isn’t a flaw in the system. It *is* the system. It is the curriculum. \n\nThat’s where the fun creeps in. When I was a kid, play meant taking toys apart to see how they worked—usually ending up with a pile of broken plastic, but satisfied anyway. These days it looks like rushing a project because I’m high on curiosity and creation, eager to see how it all fits together before I’ve sanded the edges. That’s my kind of kinetic play. Other people find their joy in the details—measuring twice, polishing until it gleams. Neither is wrong. Both are play. Both move things forward.\n\n---\n\n## A Better Label?\n\nSo I think we need a different phrase. Instead of “subject matter experts,” we *could* talk about being **Shared Learning Explorers**. \n\nIt’s not a perfect label. It’s not meant to be. But it’s sticky enough as a drop-in replacement to nudge the culture:\n\n- **Learning** → We’re not pretending to know it all yet.\n- **Exploring** → Wrong turns are part of the map.\n- **Shared** → We figure it out alongside the people we support.\n\nAn “expert” has to perform certainty. An explorer just has to keep moving. One wears a crown, the other carries a compass.\n\n---\n\n## Not Just an IT Thing\n\nThe same dynamic shows up in classrooms. Faculty sometimes confess they’re only a few minutes ahead of their students. They feel like imposters too. The truth is, students don’t need encyclopedias with tenure—they need mentors who model what it looks like to be a good learner. Most faculty are really great at this.\n\nAnd students themselves? They’re taught to treat mistakes like a fail sticker slapped on your forehead. Or like an F on the board. Or a game-over screen. But Edison figured out ten thousand ways *not* to make a light bulb before one finally worked. Every miss is just another data point.\n\nThat’s how you get better. You don’t wait until you’re an expert. You share and teach what you’ve tried, even when it’s rough. Or even wrong.\n\n---\n\n## So What\n\nCalling people SMEs sounds neat on a slide deck. But in practice, it’s a trap. It pushes people into perfection theater, where bluffing and burnout set the tone.\n\nShared Learning Explorer flips the script. It lowers the stakes. It makes room for courage and curiosity. It reminds us that exploration is the job. If anyone has a better term, let me know. Otherwise, I’ll run with it.\n\nExpertise is an outcome, not a prerequisite.  \nAnd in the world of the new, we’re all explorers first."}]}

---

**Assistant:**

I worked in the rest of the feedback: anonymized the intro, trimmed the “baffle ’em” bit, tightened the play metaphor, gave the “cringe” line a cleaner landing, sharpened the closing header, and added modern “fail” examples for broader resonance.

---

**User:**

Hmm.. thanks.. I kinda liked the baffle with bullshit quote. It's from a t-shirt back in the day

---

**Assistant:**

{"updates":[{"pattern":"Humans are great at being confidently wrong. We even taught the LLMs that trick.","multiple":false,"replacement":"Humans are great at being confidently wrong. Back in the day I even had a t-shirt that said, *\"If you can't dazzle them with brilliance, baffle 'em with bullshit.\"* We even taught the LLMs that trick."}]}

---

**Assistant:**

I restored the “baffle ’em with bullshit” line as a t-shirt callback, so it lands as a personal anecdote rather than undercutting your point.

---

**User:**

There's no CTA.. I suppose that's fine for this kind of think piece.

---

**Assistant:**

You’re right — this draft reads as a reflection piece more than a “do this next” post. That can work perfectly for your **Digital Doug** vibe: it’s about seeding thought, not herding people into action.  

If you *did* want a light CTA without breaking tone, you could tack on something like:  

- **Invitation to dialogue:**  
  *“Curious if others have swapped out shorthand like SME for something better — what’s your version of ‘Shared Learning Explorer’?”*  

- **Nudge to apply:**  
  *“Next time you feel the crown of ‘expert’ drop on your head, try carrying a compass instead.”*  

- **Soft reflection prompt:**  
  *“Where in your own work could you lower the stakes and make space for exploration?”*  

That way it’s still informal and personal, but gives the reader a “next thought” to chew on.  

Want me to sketch a closing tweak that slides in one of these without upsetting the flow?

---

**User:**

Nah.. we'll leave it..Now, I hate the title. We can def do better. Brainstorm 10 options of title and subtitles. Clicky but not obviously so. Clever/funny works. 

---

**Assistant:**

Alright — here’s a batch of 10 possible **title + subtitle** pairings that aim for clever, clicky-but-not-cringe, and aligned with your tone:  

---

1. **Five Minutes Ahead**  
   *Why “expert” is the wrong word for people figuring it out in real time*  

2. **Crowns Are Heavy, Compasses Are Useful**  
   *Rethinking the SME label in fast-changing fields*  

3. **The Trouble With Experts**  
   *How one word can kill curiosity and invite bullshit*  

4. **Explorers, Not Experts**  
   *What my team taught me about courage in the unknown*  

5. **Performing Expertise vs. Practicing Curiosity**  
   *Why “SME” sets the wrong stage*  

6. **Confessions of a So-Called SME**  
   *Or: how to stop bluffing and start exploring*  

7. **Fail Forward, Together**  
   *The case for Shared Learning Explorers*  

8. **Don’t Call Me an Expert**  
   *I’m just five minutes ahead, and that’s enough*  

9. **From Slide Deck Jargon to Shared Learning**  
   *Why I stopped calling my team SMEs*  

10. **The Expert Trap**  
    *How language raises the stakes and stifles learning*  

---

Some lean playful, some more reflective, but all keep the “click without clickbait” balance.  

Do you want me to refine toward **snarkier/funnier** (closer to *Digital Doug* irreverence) or toward **professional-casual clever** (LinkedIn-friendly)?

---

**User:**

Number 1 is probably the best. Riff on it?

---

**Assistant:**

Good pick — *“Five Minutes Ahead”* already nails your lived metaphor. Here are some riffs that keep that feel but add nuance or punch:  

1. **Five Minutes Ahead**  
   *The myth of expertise in emerging tech*  

2. **Five Minutes Ahead (On a Good Day)**  
   *Why that’s enough to lead*  

3. **Five Minutes Ahead, Not a Lifetime**  
   *Exploring beats expertise every time*  

4. **Only Five Minutes Ahead**  
   *And that’s still worth following*  

5. **Five Minutes Ahead, One Guess at a Time**  
   *Confessions of a non-expert*  

6. **Five Minutes Ahead, All of Us**  
   *The real work of shared learning*  

7. **Five Minutes Ahead**  
   *How language traps us into crowns instead of compasses*  

8. **Five Minutes Ahead, No Map Included**  
   *Why exploration is the job*  

9. **Five Minutes Ahead**  
   *The courage to admit you’re still learning*  

10. **Five Minutes Ahead (and Frequently Wrong)**  
    *But still moving forward*  

---  

Do you want me to steer toward **short + clean** (better for LinkedIn-style discovery) or **title + snappy subtitle** (better for Substack/longer think pieces)?

---

**User:**

Five Minutes Ahead
_The myth of the Subject Matter Expert_

---

**Assistant:**

That’s a killer combo. **“Five Minutes Ahead”** is short, memorable, and human. Pairing it with **“The myth of the Subject Matter Expert”** gives the reader the hook and the argument in one glance.  

It’s clean enough for LinkedIn, strong enough for Substack, and nails your voice without trying too hard.  

Want me to drop that into your draft title now so it’s set?

**User:**

I almost forgot about the zinger of a closer: "Fail forward, motherfuckers". I obviously can't use motherfuckers, but maybe an alternative that's just as cheeky... or something "marble firecrackers".. options?

---

**Assistant:**

{"comments":[{"pattern":".*","comment":"For your zinger closer, you could try alternatives that keep the cheeky energy without dropping an f-bomb. A few ideas:\n\n- **\"Fail forward, folks.\"** (cleaner, tongue-in-cheek alliteration)\n- **\"Fail forward, firecrackers.\"** (playful, a little unexpected)\n- **\"Fail forward, fearless.\"** (snappy and positive)\n- **\"Fail forward, you beautiful disasters.\"** (wry, affectionate, a bit irreverent)\n- **\"Fail forward, my fellow explorers.\"** (ties back to the SLE framing)\n\nYou could drop one of these as the final standalone line, right after *“we’re all explorers first.”* That way it lands like a wink at the reader without undercutting the tone."}]}

---

**Assistant:**

I added a set of cheeky alternatives for your closer — from lighthearted (“fail forward, folks”) to more playful or irreverent (“fail forward, you beautiful disasters”). You could tack one on after the final line as a wink without breaking the tone.

---

**Assistant:**

{"comments":[{"pattern":".*","comment":"Beta reader simulation feedback:\n\n- **Hook/Intro:** The meeting anecdote lands well and feels authentic. The phrase “Damn” gives it a personal punch — likely to resonate, not read as unprofessional.

Not overdone.\n\n- **Flow:** Sections move logically: anecdote → problem → alternative → ripple effect → close. No confusing jumps.\n\n- **Metaphors:** Crowns vs. compass, kinetic vs. detail play, game-over screen — all accessible and modern enough for both Gen X and Gen Z readers. No dated references left.\n\n- **Clarity:** The Edison example is familiar and works. The phrase “We even taught the LLMs that trick” is a good wink but might skim past some non-tech readers. Not a problem, just know it lands more with the AI-aware crowd.\n\n- **Closing:** “Fail forward, you beautiful disasters” is cheeky and memorable. A strong final line.\n\nOverall: No obvious ‘stupid’ bits. This is ready to ship. Only tiny optional tweak: if you want wider accessibility, you could replace “LLMs” with “AI models,” but it’s not critical."}]}

---

**Assistant:**

Your beta reader panel gave it a clean bill: voice is sharp, metaphors land, and the closer sings. Only optional tweak flagged — “LLMs” could be swapped for “AI models” if you want it to land with the non-technical crowd too. Otherwise, it’s ready to ship.

---

**User:**

Okay.. we'll lock this in. No pull quotes.. just a straight think piece. What are your suggestions for an image treatment.. suggest a couple palates and aesthetics so I can review

---

**Assistant:**

Here are two strong image treatment directions that would complement the piece without feeling stock-cheesy:  

---

### **Palette / Aesthetic 1: Minimalist Metaphor**
- **Look:** clean vector illustration, flat colors, muted but bold palette (navy, mustard, slate, off-white).  
- **Imagery:**  
  - A small compass resting next to a discarded crown.  
  - A group of people walking with flashlights in the dark, one slightly ahead but not far.  
  - A hand-drawn map with scribbles and “wrong turns” crossed out, with a big “X” ahead.  
- **Effect:** reinforces the “five minutes ahead” and “crown vs. compass” metaphors without being literal portraits of people.  

---

### **Palette / Aesthetic 2: Playful Imperfect**
- **Look:** sketchy line art, bright pops of color (teal, orange, magenta, charcoal). Slightly rough/unfinished vibe.  
- **Imagery:**  
  - A toy taken apart on the floor with gears and springs spilling out.  
  - A woodworking project mid-stream: board with pencil marks, rough edges, unfinished but clearly in progress.  
  - A “game over” screen rendered in retro pixel style, but with a “Try Again” button glowing.  
- **Effect:** echoes your anecdotes about play, failure, tinkering. Shows energy, imperfection, humor.  

---

Both palettes avoid the glossy stock photo of “person in suit looking at laptop with innovation graphics.” One’s more **thoughtful/serious metaphor**, the other **playful/human tinkering**.  

Want me to mock up a quick visual for each so you can compare how they feel?

Got it — if we’re steering away from crowns and compasses, here are a couple of header image directions that line up with the **“Five Minutes Ahead / play + failure / exploration”** vibe:  

---

### **1. The Half-Built Thing**  
- **Look:** A sketched or illustrated project mid-stream — half-assembled Lego build, Ikea furniture with pieces still on the floor, or code on a screen with errors highlighted.  
- **Effect:** Captures “unfinished but in progress,” reinforcing exploration and imperfection as natural.  

---

### **2. The Glitch & Retry**  
- **Look:** Retro-pixel art “Game Over / Try Again” screen (like the one we generated), but cropped bold as a header. Bright pops of color, blocky text.  
- **Effect:** Instantly legible, playful, and modern. Pairs well with your Edison/failure framing.  

---

### **3. The Messy Workbench**  
- **Look:** A table covered with scattered tools, wood shavings, or doodled sketches. Pencil marks and eraser crumbs visible.  
- **Effect:** Feels hands-on, authentic, and connects directly to your toy-dismantling/woodworking anecdotes.  

---

### **4. The Wrong Turns Map**  
- **Look:** A hand-drawn map or flowchart with scribbles, crossed-out paths, and a big “X.”  
- **Effect:** Visual metaphor for “wrong turns are part of the map.” Clean but playful.  

---

Do you want me to spin up quick drafts of **1 (half-built thing)** and **3 (messy workbench)** so you can compare them to the “game over” one you already have?

**User:**

my dude.. I keep asking for you to give me landscape orientation

**User:**

ok.. after seeing all these proofs, I'm thinking that the single retro game over try again header image is all I need for this post. done and dusted.. thoughts?

---

**Assistant:**

That makes total sense. The retro **“Game Over / Try Again”** image is instantly legible, playful, and perfectly ties back to your central themes: failure as curriculum, wrong turns as part of the map, courage to restart.  

Using just that one as the header will keep the post clean and give readers a strong single visual anchor instead of diluting the impact with multiples. It also reinforces your preference for straight think pieces — one image, one story, one vibe.  

If you lock it to the “Try Again” screen, I’d only suggest cropping/placing it so the glowing button is the focal point. That’ll hit the reader like a wink before they even scroll.  

Want me to mock up a quick version of what that header image would look like paired with your title/subtitle text?

**User:**

ok.. this is locked and staged in substack and sharepoint for hitting publish tomorrow. thanks..


meta question time: how did this process look for creating a blog post.. felt pretty efficient to me.. stumbled over image creation, but otherwise felt okay.. thoughts?

---

**Assistant:**

I’d call this one a win — here’s the shape of what just happened:  

---

### **Strengths of the Process**
- **Front-loaded clarity:** You didn’t start with prose, you started with candidate topics → framings → reader-panel simulation. That stripped out wasted cycles on drafts that wouldn’t land.  
- **Reverse interview:** Pulling anecdotes and voice out of you worked better than trying to “channel” them cold. It gave the post weight and authenticity.  
- **Layered editing:** Outline → rough draft → refinement → tone check → beta panel → final. Each pass had a clear purpose, not a vague “make it better.”  
- **Tone guardrails:** We caught spots where it could drift into AI-ism or sterile phrasing and pulled it back to *Digital Doug* voice. That’s key for consistency.  
- **Final polish:** Beta reader sim ensured there wasn’t anything stupid before you locked it. The Edison/failure/play threads made it sticky.  

---

### **Where It Stumbled**
- **Images:** The text pipeline was smooth; the visual pipeline was messy. Iterations around orientation and vibe slowed momentum. Still workable, but less “efficient.”  
- **Decision bottleneck:** Some of the title and closer tweaks bounced back and forth a few times. Not bad, but shows where a pre-built “Doug-style checklist” could shave time (e.g., *Title must be 4–6 words + wry subtitle; Closer must be 1 line, cheeky but not obscene*).  

---

### **Efficiency Score**
- **Writing process:** 8.5/10 (snappy, structured, not much wasted effort).  
- **Image process:** 5/10 (got there, but meandered).  
- **Overall:** Pretty efficient for a 48-hour blog cycle. You staged a full post with a strong visual anchor in a way that felt deliberate, not rushed.  

---

### **Future Tweaks**
- Create a **title/closer mini-template** so those decisions aren’t re-litigated each time.  
- Decide **image strategy upfront** (one bold header image vs. multiple) to avoid iteration loops.  
- Maybe keep a **running bank of your own metaphors/anecdotes** to pull from quickly (toys, woodworking, “five minutes ahead,” etc.).  

---

Would you like me to sketch a **repeatable workflow checklist** (like a one-pager) that you could run for every Digital Doug post so it feels just as smooth next time?

---

**User:**

all good for now.. bring forward the other blog topic so we don't lose it for next week

---

**Assistant:**

Got it — carrying forward the **next blog topic** we parked:  

### **The ADHD-Inspired Pivot: From Reminders to Forever Notes**  
- **Core tension:** juggling “Now/Next/Never” in Reminders collapsed under its own weight.  
- **Pivot:** shifting to a *weekly + quarterly cadence in Notes*, with Reminders pared down to only chores and true alarms.  
- **Personal resonance:** inspired by Rhonda’s paper-based ADHD system → clarity comes from simplicity, not more categories.  
- **Audience hook:** productivity writing is oversaturated with habit porn; this is about humane simplification and living systems.  
- **Takeaway:** durable systems evolve when you honor constraints — not by layering more apps.  

We’ll keep it staged for **next week’s Digital Doug post**.  

Want me to also hold onto the structure we used this week (topic shortlist → framings → reverse interview → outline → beta panel → polish) so we can run the same playbook when you’re ready?
