**User:**

Disabling the algorithm in YouTube isn’t working for me. I’m still good with keeping it off the phone, but YouTube’s interface is making the fomo feel real. I think I need to strip my subscriptions to the bone and let go of some of the topics. Eg. I subscribe to Nerdy Novelist in feeeed, do I need it in YouTube? I get the Manson Solved in podcast, do I need to follow Mark’s channel? I’ve already decided Pullein is just rehashing his book in his channels. Unsubscribe? Same with the Apple ecosystem productivity porn… is any of it truly valuable?

---

**Assistant:**

Yes—this is the right instinct. The YouTube algorithm isn’t your only problem; *subscription bloat itself becomes the algorithm*. If you want YouTube to feel less like a buffet and more like a single clean plate, you need a ruthless cull.  

### Decision Framework
- **Rule of Single Inlet:** If you already get a creator’s material in **feeeed** or **podcasts**, you don’t need the same content in YouTube. Pick the format you *actually* consume.  
- **Rule of Distinct Value:** If a channel gives you something *not available anywhere else* (unique live demos, community, visual teaching), keep it. If it’s rehashed book/podcast/blog, cut it.  
- **Rule of Energy Audit:** Ask: when you finish a video, do you feel **clearer and more capable** or just entertained/overloaded? If mostly the latter, unsubscribe.  

### Applying It to Your Examples
- **Nerdy Novelist:** Already in feeeed → drop YouTube.  
- **Mark Manson:** Already have the podcast → drop YouTube.  
- **Carl Pullein:** You nailed it—just recycling his book → unsubscribe.  
- **Apple productivity porn:** Almost all “what’s on my iPad” and “top 5 shortcuts” channels are distraction theater, not durable insight → unsubscribe unless one channel consistently fuels a real workflow shift.  

### Suggested End State
- **Lean “Core 5”** on YouTube:  
  - 1–2 channels for *true craft or storytelling* (writing, filmmaking, history).  
  - 1–2 for *deep tech/education relevance* (AI, higher-ed innovation).  
  - 1 guilty pleasure (music, oddities, Broken Peach-level joy).  

That’s it. The rest you catch in **feeeed** or podcasts—formats better suited for scanning or passive listening.  

Want me to draw up a **one-time unsubscribe pass** plan (like a checklist: prune, mute, replace) so you can strip YouTube in one decisive session instead of death by hesitation?

**User:**

Aside from a couple music and comedy channels, the only content that carries its weight are Tale Foundry, kurtseghart and answer in progress. Steve Ramsay for woodworking. Cgpgrey, veritasium, thoughty42, and Kyle hill seem to really have less value lately. 

---

**Assistant:**

Straight to the point: **Tale Foundry**, **Answer in Progress**, and **Steve Ramsey** clearly deliver unique, value-rich content—here’s why they’re still worth keeping:

---

##  Why These Channels Carry Their Weight

### Tale Foundry
- Focuses on **fiction inspiration and writing craft**, including character development, plot structure, symbolism, and literary analysis—content deeply tailored for storytellers and worldbuilders citeturn0search0turn0search20.
- Its tone is tailored to creators (“a show about made-up stuff for people who like to make stuff up”) citeturn0search3.
- Conclusion: It’s uniquely aligned with your fiction workflows; keep it.

### Answer in Progress
- Delivers **educational videos** exploring curiosity, everyday questions, and learning as a journey—cultivating a “joy of discovery” vibe citeturn0search4turn0search10.
- Creators are deliberate storytellers—mixing humor, solid research, and niche curiosity (olive oil fraud, meaning of school lessons, YouTube algorithm deep dives) citeturn0search21turn0search10turn0search8.
- It’s not infotainment fluff—it models how to ask better questions, something that aligns with your thoughtful worldbuilding. Keep it.

### Steve Ramsey – Woodworking for Mere Mortals
- Geared to **beginners with limited space and budget**, offering practical, low-barrier woodworking projects citeturn0search2turn0search16.
- Reddit reviewers praise his straightforward, intentional teaching and dry humor:
  > “I’ve learned a lot from Steve Ramsey. He doesn’t use expensive tools… he's very smart and practical…” citeturn0search7.
- If you’re still enjoying those practical shop tips or the mental shift from creation itself, it definitely stays.

---

##  Why Others Feel Less Valuable Right Now

Channels like **CGP Grey**, **Veritasium**, **Thoughty2/Thoughty42**, **Kyle Hill** often pivot toward noise—algorithm-driven curiosities that can feel shallow or repetitive. If they no longer sharpen your thinking or inform your writing direction, they're safe to drop.

---

##  Digital Diet Plan: Efficient Curation Framework

| Criterion | Apply to Channel |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Unique utility** | Does it fuel your storytelling, curiosity, or skill-building? |
| **Format advantage** | Is there content you can't get from audio or reading alternatives? |
| **Energy Return** | After watching, do you feel more grounded or just entertained? |
| **Emerging Value** | Is the channel evolving based on what you actually want in content? |

---

##  Your Trimmed YouTube Core
- **Keep:**
  - *Tale Foundry* (fiction craft, narrative depth)
  - *Answer in Progress* (curiosity, structured inquiry)
  - *Steve Ramsey* (practical making, low-friction creativity)
  - A couple of music/comedy channels for joy or creative reset.

- **Drop or mute:**
  - CGP Grey, Veritasium, Thoughty2, Kyle Hill—unless one resurfaces with truly new value.

Want a one-time “unsubscribe pass” script or checklist to methodically clear YouTube in one sweep?

---

**User:**

Kurtgesart is good. I can never spell it right. 

---

**Assistant:**

Kurzgesagt — “In a Nutshell.” Easy mnemonic: **Kurz = short, gesagt = said** → “shortly said.”  

They’re still worth keeping if:  
- You actually watch full videos (not just let them queue).  
- Their blend of **systems thinking + art style** sparks story/worldbuilding ideas.  
- You don’t already get the same material from books/podcasts you prefer.  

If they’ve slipped into “background entertainment,” cut. If they still jolt your thinking (“what if civilization collapsed tomorrow?”), keep.  

Want me to sketch a **final core roster** (music, comedy, Tale Foundry, Answer in Progress, Kurzgesagt, Ramsey) so you’ve got a clean short list to work from?

---

**User:**

Comedy. Julie nolke (Canadian), Elle Cordova.  Music: broken peach (maybe), scary pockets and postmodern jukebox for sure. Kiffness and Carter vail? Not sure. 

---

**Assistant:**

Here’s a clean draft roster built around what you’ve said actually carries weight:  

---

## 🎭 Comedy  
- **Julie Nolke** — stays. Consistently sharp, Canadian voice, high replay value.  
- **Elle Cordova** — stays. Original, quirky, distinct tone.  

*(That’s already a tidy duo—no need to pad out comedy with weaker channels.)*  

---

## 🎶 Music  
- **Scary Pockets** — keep. Funky, rotating vocalists, fresh energy.  
- **Postmodern Jukebox** — keep. Polished, reliable, endless arrangements.  
- **Broken Peach** — conditional keep. They’re fun, but if their seasonal cadence or shtick starts to feel stale, drop.  
- **The Kiffness** — borderline. He’s clever, but a lot of meme-y repetition—if you’re not *excited* to click, unsubscribe.  
- **Carter Vail** — decide if you’re listening for *music* or *persona*. If he’s not in rotation on Apple Music/Spotify, YouTube sub might not be worth it.  

---

## 📚 Thought & Craft  
- **Tale Foundry** — core keep. Writing + worldbuilding fuel.  
- **Answer in Progress** — core keep. Curiosity + storytelling lens.  
- **Kurzgesagt** — keep, if you still get conceptual sparks (otherwise demote to “check when shared”).  
- **Steve Ramsey** — keep. Practical creativity, low-friction.  

---

## ❌ Drop List (low value lately)  
- CGP Grey  
- Veritasium  
- Thoughty42  
- Kyle Hill  
- Apple productivity “what’s on my iPad” channels  

---

That leaves you with about **10–12 channels total**:  
- 2 comedy  
- 3–4 music  
- 4 thought/craft  
- Plus the seasonal “maybe” (Broken Peach, Kiffness, Carter Vail)  

A lean list you can actually keep up with, without FOMO.  

---  

Want me to write you a **single-pass unsubscribe checklist** (copy-paste ready) so you can blitz this in one 15-minute sweep and never second-guess it?

**User:**

Opinions on: loewhaley, xkcd what if, ze frank, thejuicemedia, owlkitty

---

**Assistant:**

Here’s the assessment of the remaining channels—cutting through the FOMO fog with structure and clarity:

---

##  Evaluations

### 1. **LoeWhaley (Work Bestie / Laura Whaley)**
- Based in Vancouver, Laura Whaley offers a quirky, office-friendly tone under the “Work Bestie” brand. Content includes light workplace commentary and short form voiceovers like “Toodaloo, Laura.”citeturn0search5turn0search22
- Some “behind the scenes” and workplace culture reflections pop upciteturn0search9.
- **Verdict:** If you use her videos to puncture workday fatigue with a little dry, relatable humor, she’s worth keeping. If it's just background noise, consider dropping or revisiting occasionally.

---

### 2. **xkcd’s What If? (Official YouTube)**
- Official video adaptation of Randall Munroe’s *What If?* books, released on August 31, 2023; narrated by Munroe with xkcd-style animation produced by Neptune Studiosciteturn1search18turn1search7.
- Treats absurd scenarios with rigorous, thoughtful science—true worldbuilding fuel if you lean into speculative frameworksciteturn1search7turn1search18.
- **Verdict:** High-per-minute insight. Keeps the mental gears turning, aligns with creative exploration. Lean keep.

---

### 3. **The Juice Media**
- Australian satire outfit behind *Honest Government Ads* and *Juice Rap News*citeturn1search0turn1search3turn1search13.
- Sharp, socially aware commentary that doesn’t pull punches—even led to legal heat in 2024 when one video about Tasmanian election law required censorshipciteturn1search10.
- **Verdict:** If political satire keeps your mental edge sharp, it pays to stay. If you’re redirecting energy inward (writing, creating), it may not deserve a slot.

---

### 4. **Ze Frank**
- No explicit data surfaced here, but known as early YouTube and interactive internet pioneer—mixes absurd humor with thoughtful cultural commentary.
- **Verdict:** If nostalgic, meta humor fuels your creative thinking, consider keeping. But if he’s fallen out of rotation, easy unsubscribe candidate.

---

### 5. **OwlKitty**
- Cat named Lizzy, edited into iconic film scenes—parodies like *Jurassic Park*, *Titanic*, *Barbie*, *Top Gun*, *Twilight*; polished, surreal meta-humorciteturn0search1turn0search17turn0search24.
- Content is infrequent (a few times a year)citeturn0search4.
- **Verdict:** Cute, low-demand comedic reset—perfect “joy rest” territory. Keep if you still chuckle; easily mute if it's losing shine.

---

##  Summary Table

| Channel               | Value Type              | Verdict                            |
|----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **LoeWhaley**         | Relatable, light whimsy | Keep if you use it for micro-breaks; drop if it’s just noise |
| **xkcd’s What If?**   | Speculative science     | Keep—it aligns with curiosity and narrative structure |
| **The Juice Media**   | Sharp satire, social    | Keep if mental provocation matters; else drop |
| **Ze Frank**          | Meta humor, early YouTube | Keep if you revisit archives; else archive and drop |
| **OwlKitty**          | Cute, low-frequency comedy | Keep as joy-pillow content; drop if it feels performative |

Let me know if you want an ultra-lean "Core 8" roster + one liner reasons—or a tidy unsubscribe checklist to blitz command-style.

---

**User:**

Puddles pity party?

---

**Assistant:**

**Puddles Pity Party** = big man, sad clown, golden pipes.  

- **Strengths:**  
  - Stripped-down, almost absurdly sincere covers (esp. 80s/90s classics).  
  - Mood-shifting: works as both comedy and catharsis.  
  - Unique enough that nobody else fills the same slot.  

- **Weaknesses:**  
  - Cadence is sporadic.  
  - Can drift into “same trick again” if you’re not actively in the mood for melancholy-meets-camp.  

**Verdict:** If you’ve ever *needed* a Puddles cover at 2am, you know the value. He’s not a volume sub—he’s a “comfort oddity” sub. Keep him as a rare gem rather than a core channel.  

Want me to fold him into your short-list framework (music/comedy/craft) so you see how the whole roster balances?

**User:**

Tiago forte, Vicky Zhao, spoonfedstudy?

---

**Assistant:**

Straight to value: **Tiago Forte**, **Vicky Zhao**, and **SpoonFedStudy** all deliver distinct themes, but their YouTube returns vary in creative reward. Here’s the structured breakdown:

---

##  Channel Reviews

### **Tiago Forte**
- Focus: Productivity frameworks, especially *PARA* and *Building a Second Brain*. Deep strategy, learning systems, and PKM.
- Style: Polished, team-supported educational videos—“high-content density,” structured insight, occasional case studies or tool walk-throughs.citeturn0search6turn0search15turn0search24
- Value: Strong for system design and craftful workflows. Worth keeping if you still use Second Brain approaches or enjoy thinking in layered frameworks.

### **Vicky Zhao**
- I couldn’t find clear evidence of her YouTube output or whether it aligns with your interests. The search results mostly return unrelated profiles (Chinese actress Zhao Wei) or outdated blog show-notes.citeturn0search1turn0search16turn0search30turn0search31
- Recommendation: Unless you’re certain she’s the creator whose content you find valuable, treat this as a *file under “needs confirmation.”*

### **SpoonFedStudy**
- Focus: Mindset hacks, personal upgrade, productivity motivation—“hack your brain to crave doing hard things,” “secret hack that makes procrastination impossible.”citeturn0search17turn0search28turn0search14
- Style: Motivational, formulaic, quick-hit mindset frameworks. Less craft depth, more pep-talk energy.
- Value: If you need a spike of cognitive fuel now and again, it works. But it’s not foundational—more of a short-term boost.

##  Quick Comparison Table

| Channel           | Core Value                            | Current Verdict                                       |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Tiago Forte**   | High-density systems & PKM strategy    | Keep—valuable beyond fluff; directly applicable        |
| **Vicky Zhao**    | Unclear / needs confirmation            | Pending—verify identity and content quality            |
| **SpoonFedStudy** | Motivational mindset boosters           | Keep if occasional surge helps; otherwise demote       |

---

Let me know if you'd like a one-line justification for each in your lean roster—“Core 8” style—or a quick unsubscribe/mute pattern when it comes time to prune.

---

**User:**

Tiago is another one of those book types like Carl, cal, Ali, etc. prolly unsung

---

**Assistant:**

Exactly. Tiago (like Carl Pullein, Cal Newport, Ali Abdaal) is primarily **repurposing the book/course flywheel**: each video is a riff on *Building a Second Brain*, sprinkled with tool demos and evergreen productivity tropes. If you’ve read the book (or absorbed the framework), the YouTube channel is mostly reinforcement theater.  

### Why He Feels Redundant  
- **Content loop:** book → blog → course → YouTube → podcast → newsletter → back to book.  
- **Signal density:** low once you’ve internalized PARA/Second Brain.  
- **Net effect:** creates FOMO more than fresh ideas.  

### Verdict  
- If you want a “book-type shelf” in YouTube, keep just *one* (Ali for vibe, Cal for rigor, etc.).  
- But given your goal to strip subscriptions to the bone, Tiago belongs with Carl → **unsubscribe**.  

Want me to audit your whole **“book-type cluster”** (Ali, Cal, Tiago, Carl, maybe Matt D’Avella) and tell you which—if any—is worth keeping as your single anchor?

---

**User:**

Spoonfedstudy might be a candidate for my high signal rss feeeed?

---

**Assistant:**

That’s the smarter placement.  

### Why SpoonFedStudy fits **feeeed** better than YouTube  
- **Format:** Most videos are single-idea, punchy, and easily skimmed → perfect for a quick scan in Feedd rather than sitting through a 10–15 min video.  
- **Signal vs Noise:** You’ll see the headline and summary; if it’s the same “do hard things” pep-talk, you skip it instantly. If it’s a genuinely novel framing, you click.  
- **Energy match:** RSS lets you catch the *occasional gem* without letting the channel hijack your attention economy on YouTube.  

### Recommendation  
- Move SpoonFedStudy into **feeeed**.  
- Unsubscribe from YouTube.  
- Treat it as an *“ambient signal drip”* you can scan at will, not an algorithm-injected temptation.  

Want me to draft a **clean three-tier map** for you (YouTube core / feeeed signal drip / podcasts), so each channel/creator has exactly one “inlet” in your system? That would kill redundancy and FOMO in one go.

---

**User:**

Vicky Zhao is @VickyZhaoBEEAMP

---

**Assistant:**

Straight to it: **Vicky Zhao [BEEAMP]** is very much a “framework-first” creator—clarity and structure fuel her, and she aims to help you think more deliberately.

---

##  Channel Snapshot: Vicky Zhao [BEEAMP]
- About **282–283K subscribers**, ~195–196 videos. Her branding: *Frameworks & Tools for Clear Thinking and Clear Communications* citeturn0search2turn0search5.
- Recent topics include:
  - “3 ChatGPT Prompts I Use to Stand Out at Work”
  - “3 Secret Skills No One Talks About at Work”
  - “5 Questions to Answer in Your 2025 System” citeturn0search1.

### Why She Aligns with Your System-First Style
- Delivers **structured thinking distilled into accessible formats**—perfect for quick absorption and systems-based reflection.
- The content is **explicitly modular**: “habits that changed my life,” “framework thinking in 3 steps,” etc., so you can skim for what lands.
- It’s highly compatible with both your **Apple Notes execution pipeline** and your **Obsidian ZORA vault**—you can harvest discrete ideas or mental models easily.

---

##  Recommendation
- Treat Vicky Zhao as **core “thinking tools” content**.
- **Keep her** in YouTube—but expect she’s more “nugget feeder” than “deep craft resource.”
- If you're trying to consolidate where you pull structured thinking from (YouTube vs podcasts vs blogs), she belongs in whichever medium you’re more likely to scan—YouTube is fine, though an RSS feed could work if she publishes blog or newsletter content too (not checked).

Would you like me to integrate her into your **lean roster layout**? Something like:

- **Core YouTube sources** (fiction, curiosity, thinking frameworks, creativity rest)
- **‘Signal-only’ feed** (RSS/blogs you skim for high-density frameworks)

…so you can see where she best fits into your curated ecosystem?

---

**User:**

Vicky might be good for  rss reader. Low volume and high signal. There isn’t much of this content in my yt subs any more. It’d be kinda weird. Maybe?

---

**Assistant:**

Not weird at all—actually elegant.  

### Why Vicky Zhao fits RSS better than YouTube for you  
- **Cadence:** Low-volume, so she won’t bloat your Feeds inbox.  
- **Format:** Her content is *headline-driven frameworks* (“5 questions…”, “3 prompts…”). Perfect for scan-and-decide.  
- **Redundancy check:** Your YouTube core is now leaning heavily toward *craft, curiosity, joy* (Tale Foundry, Kurzgesagt, Answer in Progress, Steve Ramsey, music/comedy). Framework/mental-model stuff isn’t well-represented there anymore—and maybe shouldn’t be.  
- **System coherence:** RSS is your *signal cabinet* for deliberate thinking. Adding Vicky there means you’re keeping YouTube as your “recreational/creative bench” instead of letting it slide back into productivity-theatre creep.  

### Recommendation  
- Put **Vicky Zhao → Feeds (RSS)**.  
- Don’t sub on YouTube. That way, she’s in the *“thinking tools dripline”* where she belongs, not mixed into your “watch” space.  

Want me to map you a **final three-lane roster** (YouTube core / RSS signal drip / Podcasts) so each lane has a clean, non-overlapping purpose? That would lock the system.

**User:**

The writing folks still in my yt are @writingsecrets, Kieran Westwood,bookfox. These folks worth it or just recycling advice?

---

**Assistant:**

Here’s the low-down on those writing channels you’re weighing—clear, structured, ruthless clarity.

---

##  Channel Breakdown

### **Kieren Westwood**
- Active fiction writer and freelance editor whose **YouTube videos are used as teaching aids in classrooms worldwide**citeturn0search11turn0search5.
- Videos focus on practical craft: dialogue clarity, scene realism, beginner motivationciteturn0search9turn0search14turn0search7.
- **Verdict:** Consistently value-rich—shares explicit techniques and voice-centric advice. Keep, if you still dive into craft or editorial thinking.

---

### **WritingSecrets (Christopher Kokoski)**
- Blogging and YouTube creator sharing **weekly content on writing, blogging, and AI**citeturn1search0turn1search2.
- Likely a broader scope—content may blend media strategy with writing tips.
- **Verdict:** Potentially light on fiction depth, heavier on audience-building/pop-marketing. If your YouTube is already lean on these, this could be redundant or prioritised lower. Consider moving to RSS if you’re still curious about the intersection but don’t want sub noise.

---

### **Bookfox (John Matthew Fox)**
- Fiction-focused channel by an ex-teacher and editor. Offers structured craft advice—plotting, dialogue, novel mechanicsciteturn1search1turn1search3turn1search15.
- Often framed as clear how-to episodes (“9 mistakes,” “weak words to delete,” etc.)citeturn1search13turn1search11turn1search17.
- Backed by real editorial credibility and ongoing site/blog infrastructureciteturn1search19.
- **Verdict:** High signal, focused, and actionable—if you still use video format for technique input, keep this as core.

---

##  Summary Table

| Channel             | Value Type                            | Recommendation                          |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Kieren Westwood** | Craft-focused, authentic, editor-led  | **Keep**—valuable craft fuel             |
| **WritingSecrets**  | Blogging/AI infancy + writing surface | **Consider RSS or low priority skip**    |
| **Bookfox**         | Structured fiction technique          | **Keep**—solid craft and intent          |

---

Let me know if you’d like them sorted into your final channel tiers—YouTube core, RSS signal, podcasts—or trimmed entirely.

---

**User:**

Hmm does mythcreants  in my rss feed actuall do most of this already?

---

**Assistant:**

Yes — and that’s the key overlap check.  

### What Mythcreants Already Gives You (RSS)  
- **Editorial craft depth:** Point-of-view, pacing, structure, character arcs.  
- **Practical writing advice:** Not broad “be inspired” fluff, but step-by-step mechanics.  
- **Consistency:** Weekly long-form posts that already hit the “technique injection” slot you’re keeping Bookfox/Kieren for.  

### Overlap With Your YouTube Writers  
- **Bookfox:** Structured how-to → overlaps strongly with Mythcreants.  
- **Kieren Westwood:** Classroom-style tips → also overlaps, though a bit more video-centric in delivery.  
- **WritingSecrets:** Broader (marketing/blog/AI) → less overlap, but less relevant for your focus anyway.  

### Distinction  
- **Mythcreants:** Text-based, systematic, evergreen—perfect for RSS signal drip.  
- **YouTube writing channels:** More *performative* and often recycling the same basics.  

### Verdict  
- If Mythcreants is already in your **high-signal RSS lane**, you don’t *need* Bookfox or Kieren on YouTube unless you genuinely prefer *watching craft advice* as part of downtime.  
- WritingSecrets? Easier cut—too much overlap and less depth.  

So the question: do you want **any** writing-craft YouTube in your “watch” lane, or should that whole category collapse into RSS (Mythcreants + blogs) so YouTube stays cleanly for craft *inspiration* (Tale Foundry, Ramsey, Kurzgesagt) and joy (music, comedy)?  

Want me to sketch that version of the final roster so you can see how it looks stripped of all writing-advice channels on YT?

---

**User:**

Doesn’t look like I need any write craft stuff in yt 

---

**Assistant:**

That’s the cleanest move.  

### Why it Works  
- **RSS already covers the depth.** Mythcreants (plus any blog/podcast you add) gives you all the “craft injection” you actually apply.  
- **YouTube becomes genre-segmented.** Instead of fighting productivity-theatre creep, you keep it fun, inspiring, or practical in a *different* register (Tale Foundry, Kurzgesagt, Ramsey, music, comedy).  
- **Less redundancy, less FOMO.** You won’t be re-hearing the same “avoid adverbs” or “three-act structure” videos in five formats.  

### Impact on Your Core  
- **YouTube = creative rest + spark** (story fuel, curiosity, making, joy).  
- **RSS = deliberate craft + frameworks** (Mythcreants, Vicky Zhao, SpoonFedStudy, others you scan).  
- **Podcasts = narrative deep dives & thinkers** (Manson, Cal, etc., where voice/longform makes sense).  

So yeah—no craft channels left in YouTube. They live in RSS, where scanning beats bingeing.  

Want me to build you a **final roster table** (YT / RSS / Podcasts) so you see everything at a glance, non-overlapping? That’d give you the map to prune decisively.

**User:**

A couple ai resources in Yt. Please evaluate: Jeff su, @richardccampbell, d-squared 

---

**Assistant:**

Here’s the polished, structured evaluation of your AI-focused YouTube channels:

---

##  AI Channel Assessments

### **Jeff Su**
- **Focus**: Practical AI workflows—building agent tools, no-code tutorials, efficiency hacks. Videos like *“The AI Agent Tutorial That Should’ve Been Your First (no code)”* show immediate, usable value citeturn0search6.
- **Value**: High signal. Easily labeled “use-it-now” content—ideal for direct application or inspiration in your tech-oriented workflows.
- **Verdict**: **Solid keep** if you're looking for actionable AI habits and tool-based efficiency—all aligned with your blend of creativity + productivity.

---

### **Richard C Campbell**
- **Focus**: Broad AI context: historical perspectives, educational use in teaching, and software development futures—e.g., *“Artificial Intelligence – How We Got Here”* and *“The Next Decade of Software Development”* citeturn0search4turn0search28.
- **Value**: Tend to the conceptual side—good for framing and long-form thinking about AI’s role in society and development.
- **Verdict**: **Keep if you want thoughtful context** in your YouTube lane. If it leans too tech industry and less story/worldbuilding, consider shifting to RSS or podcasts.

---

### **D-Squared**
- **Focus**: AI automation tricks and evaluation systems, tech-heavy how-to content. One video, *“Top 3 LLM Evaluation Factors for Devs,”* exemplifies the niche, developer-oriented usefulness citeturn0search23.
- **Value**: High utility if you’re building or modeling systems, flows, agents. Straight-to-point, focused.
- **Verdict**: **Keep**, but only if you actively tinker with AI systems or prompt design architecture. Otherwise, a good candidate for RSS.

| **D-Squared**       | AI systems + evaluation techniques     | Keep if you're into building; else RSS |

---

##  Where They Fit in Your Lane Architecture

- **YouTube (Creative/Tool Rest Space)**:
  - **Jeff Su** – sharp, practical, tool-forward.
  - **(Optionally) Richard Campbell** – if you want occasional big-picture AI perspective right in your viewing lane.
  - **(Optionally) D-Squared** – only if you're coding/building; else move to RSS to minimize noise.

- **RSS (Signal-Only Feed)**:
  - **D-Squared** – perfect for the occasional deep-dive on AI systems or prompt tactics.
  - **Richard Campbell** – context pieces that you’d prefer to scan rather than watch.
  - **Jeff Su** – rare move here unless volume creeps up.

---

Let me know if you’d like these slotted into your **three-column roster layout**—you’ll immediately see how each creator either sharpens your spark or just recycles rhetoric.

|----------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **D-Squared**   |  Yes—solid if you're building with AI |  Optional—move if you want to clean the lane later |

---

Let me know if you'd like D-Squared slotted formally into your lean roster structure (YouTube / RSS / Podcast) or profiled for a quick unsubscribe decision down the line.

---

**User:**

Hmm. Might keep d-squared,Campbell and Vicky in yt but drop Jeff


---

**Assistant:**

That actually makes sense—here’s why your instinct tracks:  

### Why Drop Jeff Su  
- **Cadence:** High-frequency uploads = inbox bloat.  
- **Style:** More “tool hype” and productivity-theatre flavored, less enduring insight.  
- **Overlap:** Much of his “how to use AI for X” repeats what you’ll already see in feeds/blogs.  

### Why Keep D-Squared, Campbell, Vicky (on YouTube)  
- **D-Squared (@d-squared70):** Practical but not overwhelming; grounded automations, small-scale tinkering—aligns with how you *actually* like experimenting.  
- **Richard Campbell:** Conceptual, slower cadence, more like a lecture you can dip into—fits your “spark / context” category.  
- **Vicky Zhao:** Low-volume, high-signal frameworks. She’s the “thinking tools” anchor on YouTube now that you’ve cleared out the redundant craft channels.  

### Net Result for Your YT Lane  
- **Story fuel / inspiration:** Tale Foundry, Kurzgesagt, Answer in Progress.  
- **Practical craft / making:** Steve Ramsey.  
- **Joy reset:** Julie Nolke, Elle Cordova, Scary Pockets, PMJ, etc.  
- **AI/Thinking tools:** D-Squared, Campbell, Vicky Zhao.  

That keeps YouTube lean but still multi-flavored: story, joy, practical, conceptual.  

Want me to draft the **final consolidated roster table** (YT / RSS / Podcasts) so you can see exactly what survived the purge?

---

**User:**

Hmm. So with that roster, should nerdy novelist be in yt or rss?

---

**Assistant:**

Nerdy Novelist is pure **craft/technique drip** — short, digestible writing prompts, trope dissections, “here’s how to fix X in your novel.”  

### Why it fits **RSS** better:  
- **Format:** Headline-driven (“5 character flaws…”, “how to build tension”), perfect to scan and only open if relevant.  
- **Overlap:** Same lane as Mythcreants, Bookfox, Kieren → already covered in your **RSS signal drip**.  
- **YouTube tension:** Keeping it there pulls your YT lane back toward “craft advice” — the very category you just decided to excise.  

### Verdict  
- **RSS**: Yes. Keep it as a skimmable craft feed in Feeds.  
- **YouTube**: No. It undermines your cleaner lane definition.  

This way your YouTube roster = *inspiration, context, joy, and tools* — while all the “how to write better” stuff lives in RSS, where you can dip in without FOMO.  

Want me to redraw your **final three-lane table** with Nerdy Novelist shifted to RSS so you can see the full balance at a glance?

---

**User:**

Are we talking the same nerdy novelist? I’m talking about Jason Hamilton

---

**Assistant:**

Clear answer: Yes—it’s the same **Nerdy Novelist**. Jason Hamilton is the creator behind that channel. He’s a fantasy author, former content manager at Kindlepreneur, and a leading voice on using AI for creative writing.citeturn0search1turn0search14turn0search15

---

##  Where He Really Lands in Your Content Architecture

- **Not just craft**—this is *AI-augmented craft*.  
- More *tool-savvy than abstract*, more *framework-aware than surface-level motivation*.

### So where does he fit?

| Creator / Channel        | YouTube Fit        | RSS Fit              |
|--------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| **Jason Hamilton (Nerdy Novelist)** |  Strong—tactical and creative, low volume |  Optional if you prefer scans, but YT works |

 **Verdict:** Keep him on **YouTube**—especially if content that blends craft rigor with AI systems excites you. His videos are neither repetitive fluff nor light on structure—instead, they’re fuel for doing more and doing it smarter.

---

Let me know if you want to reposition him in your “lean roster table” or see exactly how your lineup looks now—with story fuel, practical creation, AI thinking, and joy all balanced and intentional.

---

**User:**

So what does my yt look like now?

---

**Assistant:**

Here’s your **post-purge YouTube roster**, organized by lane. This reflects all the decisions you’ve made in this thread:  

---

## 🎭 Comedy / Joy Reset  
- **Julie Nolke** – sharp Canadian sketches.  
- **Elle Cordova** – quirky, musical comedy.  
- **OwlKitty** – occasional film parody joy.  
- **Puddles Pity Party** – rare gem for comfort oddity.  

---

## 🎶 Music / Energy Reset  
- **Scary Pockets** – funky rotating covers.  
- **Postmodern Jukebox** – polished retro arrangements.  
- **Broken Peach** – seasonal fun (conditional keep).  
- **Carter Vail** – optional, persona/music balance.  
- **The Kiffness** – optional, meme-y repetition.  

*(Core: Scary Pockets + PMJ. The rest = joy side-dishes.)*  

---

## 📚 Story Fuel & Curiosity  
- **Tale Foundry** – worldbuilding, writing inspiration.  
- **Answer in Progress** – curiosity-driven storytelling.  
- **Kurzgesagt** – systems thinking + visuals (keep if still sparky).  

---

## 🛠 Practical Craft / Making  
- **Steve Ramsey** – woodworking for mere mortals.  

---

## 🤖 AI & Thinking Tools  
- **D-Squared (@d-squared70)** – practical AI automations.  
- **Richard Campbell** – conceptual/contextual AI & dev future.  
- **Vicky Zhao** – high-signal frameworks, low volume.  
- **Jason Hamilton (Nerdy Novelist)** – AI + writing craft (kept as distinct because he’s not just “avoid adverbs” advice).  

---

## ❌ Dropped / Moved to RSS  
- **Jeff Su** – too hype / noisy.  
- **Carl Pullein, Cal Newport, Ali Abdaal, Tiago Forte** – book-loop productivity theatre.  
- **CGP Grey, Veritasium, Thoughty42, Kyle Hill** – less spark lately.  
- **WritingSecrets, Bookfox, Kieren Westwood** – folded into Mythcreants / RSS lane.  
- **Nerdy Novelist (general craft)** – clarified: Jason Hamilton’s channel is AI-craft, so it stays in YouTube.  

---

## Totals  
- **Comedy/Joy:** 4 core + 2 optional.  
- **Music:** 2 core + 3 optional.  
- **Story/Curiosity:** 3.  
- **Practical craft:** 1.  
- **AI/Thinking:** 4.  
→ **Core = ~14** channels, with ~5 “optional/seasonal” side-dishes you can mute or trim anytime.  

---

This is a **tight, multipurpose bench**: joy resets, story sparks, one practical maker, and three AI/thinking anchors.  
Everything else (deep craft, frameworks, fluff) lives in RSS or podcasts.  

Want me to make you a **one-page “Unsubscribe Pass” checklist** so you can blitz through the YouTube settings in a single sweep without second-guessing?

---

**User:**

Ok. Woodworking in yt seems to be prefer for yt. But most of the channels are algorithm whores. Steve Ramsey is great. I kinda like the artistry of encurtis but he is more inspiration and vibes. Is there any other top tier woodworking channels out there that are Ramsey useful or encurtis aesthetic prestige channel? No attentionvwhores please

---

**Assistant:**

You’re shooting for woodworking channels that deliver either Steve Ramsey–style practicality or Enc Curtis–style aesthetic inspiration—without pandering to the algorithm. Here are four top-tier, low-FOMO picks that fit that ethos precisely:

---

##  Recommended Woodworking Channels (No Algorithm Performers)

### 1. **Frank Howarth**  
- Former architect turned woodworker, Frank creates mesmerizing stop-motion videos showing projects in stunning detail. Visually rich, deeply artisanal, zero algorithm-bait. citeturn0search9turn0search16

### 2. **Eoin Reardon (Pintofplane)**  
- Irish traditional woodworker focused on hand-tool craft, tool restoration, and making with heritage methods. Quiet, authentic, and deeply satisfying—he’s about the craft, not clicks. citeturn0news12turn0search18

### 3. **The Woodwright’s Shop (Roy Underhill)**  
- A PBS legend in traditional woodworking—hand tools, timber framing, and slow-process elegance. Educational, calm, and entirely unswayed by YouTube trends. citeturn0search17turn0search19

### 4. **Primitive Technology**  
- Not exactly woodworking, but certainly pure craft—this channel shows building with natural materials from scratch, with no dialogue and only ambient sounds. It’s meditative, authentic, and deeply inspiring. citeturn0search14

---

##  Reddit Says…  
A quick nod from Reddit woodworking communities underscores this roster’s quality:

> “I’m currently watching… Stumpy Nubs and The Wood Whisperer.” citeturn0search4

While those are well-liked, they’re high-volume and algorithmically optimized—less aligned with your preference for substance over spectacle.

---

##  Summary Table

| Channel                  | Strength | Why It Deserves Spot |
|--------------------------|----------|-----------------------|
| **Frank Howarth**        | Aesthetic artistry | Stop-motion craft, inspiring and refined |
| **Eoin Reardon**         | Traditional tool craft | Hand-tool mastery with integrity |
| **The Woodwright’s Shop**| Legacy teaching | Slow, authentic instruction with depth |
| **Primitive Technology** | Raw craftsmanship | Zero narration, pure process beauty |

---

You’ve already got Steve Ramsey for practical creativity and Encurtis for the vibe/artistry. These four flesh out a woodworking YouTube lane that’s lean, inspiring, and free from algorithmic fluff.

Want a copy-paste list to drop into your YouTube subscriptions or a quick “unsubscribe pass” plan to clear the rest in one go?

---

**User:**

Imma skip them all and just stick with Ramsay 

---

**Assistant:**

That’s the cleanest call.  

- **Steve Ramsey = utility + approachability.** He gives you the “doable projects with sanity” lane, without slipping into algorithm-chasing.  
- Everyone else—even the prestige/artistry channels—risks pulling you back toward browsing rather than building.  

So YouTube woodworking for you = **one voice, one anchor**. No noise, no temptation.  

That leaves your roster nicely balanced: story fuel, curiosity, joy/music, AI thinking, *and* one craft channel that’s actually useful when you want to make something.  

Want me to redraw your **final lean YT roster** one more time (post-Ramsey decision) so you can see the fully locked set?

---

**User:**

Sure

---

**Assistant:**

Here’s your **final lean YouTube roster**, post-Ramsey decision. Clean, balanced, no dead weight:  

---

## 🎭 Comedy / Joy Reset  
- **Julie Nolke** – sharp Canadian sketches.  
- **Elle Cordova** – quirky, musical comedy.  
- **OwlKitty** – rare, delightful film parodies.  
- **Puddles Pity Party** – melancholy oddball comfort.  

---

## 🎶 Music / Energy Reset  
- **Scary Pockets** – funky rotating covers.  
- **Postmodern Jukebox** – polished retro arrangements.  
- *(Optional Joys)*: Broken Peach, Carter Vail, The Kiffness.  

---

## 📚 Story Fuel & Curiosity  
- **Tale Foundry** – narrative/worldbuilding spark.  
- **Answer in Progress** – curiosity + storytelling lens.  
- **Kurzgesagt** – systems thinking + gorgeous visuals.  

---

## 🛠 Practical Craft  
- **Steve Ramsey** – woodworking for mere mortals. *(sole craft anchor, no algorithm fluff)*  

---

## 🤖 AI & Thinking Tools  
- **D-Squared (@d-squared70)** – practical AI automations.  
- **Richard Campbell** – conceptual AI / dev futures.  
- **Vicky Zhao** – frameworks & clear thinking (low volume).  
- **Jason Hamilton (Nerdy Novelist)** – AI + writing craft integration.  

---

## Totals  
- **Comedy/Joy:** 4  
- **Music:** 2 core (+3 optional)  
- **Story/Curiosity:** 3  
- **Practical Craft:** 1  
- **AI/Thinking:** 4  

**≈14 core channels**, with 3 optional “side-dish” subs you can mute or drop anytime.  

---

This lineup keeps YouTube as:  
- *Joy resets* (comedy/music)  
- *Curiosity sparks* (Tale Foundry, Kurzgesagt, Answer in Progress)  
- *One practical making lane* (Ramsey)  
- *AI/thinking tools that complement RSS without bloating it*  

No craft-repeaters, no productivity theatre, no algorithm bait.  

Want me to also sketch the **RSS + Podcasts complements** so you see the whole three-lane ecosystem (YT / RSS / Pods) locked together?

---

**User:**

What does my rss feeeed look like?

---

**Assistant:**

Here’s how your **high-signal RSS Feeds** lane looks after all our pruning and shifting:  

---

## 📡 Core Craft & Writing  
- **Mythcreants** – deep, systematic craft essays (POV, arcs, pacing).  
- **Nerdy Novelist (Jason Hamilton)** – *moved here if you want skim-mode only for AI+craft*. You kept him in YouTube, but RSS is a backup option if YT feels noisy.  
- **Bookfox / Kieren Westwood / WritingSecrets** – effectively collapsed into Mythcreants → no need for them in YouTube.  

---

## 🧠 Frameworks & Thinking Tools  
- **Vicky Zhao** – clear, structured mental models (kept in YT, but RSS-ready if cadence rises).  
- **SpoonFedStudy** – headline-style mindset/motivation posts, perfect to scan for the occasional gem.  

---

## 🤖 AI / Digital Innovation (Optional)  
- **D-Squared** – if you don’t want AI automations clogging YouTube, RSS is the “signal drip” mode.  
- **Richard Campbell** – longer-form context works better in podcast/video, but if there’s a blog feed, RSS is the right lane.  

---

## 📰 General Signal Cabinet  
- Other sources you’ve already seeded in Feeds (policy, higher-ed, productivity, etc.).  
- This is where you enforce your **lean subscription ethos**: drop instantly if cadence bloats or tone drifts.  

---

## Summary  
- **Core RSS = Mythcreants, SpoonFedStudy, Vicky Zhao (if not in YT).**  
- **Optional = D-Squared, Nerdy Novelist, Richard Campbell (if you’d rather skim context).**  
- **Role of Feeds**: **Scan → pluck gems → star → study desk**. Never binge, never FOMO.  

---

Do you want me to draw you the **full three-lane ecosystem table (YT / RSS / Podcasts)** so you see every creator and where they live, with no overlaps? That way you can lock the whole thing and unsubscribe with confidence.

---

**User:**

Spoonfedstudy probably should stay in yt. It’s only one of these kinds of channels. Let rss reader be about text. 

---

**Assistant:**

That’s a smart boundary. Keeps your lanes clean:  

- **RSS = text-first, longform craft + frameworks** (Mythcreants, blogs, essays).  
- **YouTube = video-native stuff only** (including SpoonFedStudy, since the delivery is half the impact).  

---

## Updated Lane Roles  

### 📡 RSS (Text-Only Signal Cabinet)  
- **Mythcreants** – structured writing craft.  
- **Vicky Zhao (optional)** – if you ever want frameworks in skim-mode, but fine to leave on YT since she’s low-volume.  
- Other blogs/feeds (policy, higher ed, etc.).  
- **Rule:** no “video-first” creators here. Only written outputs that stand on their own.  

### ▶️ YouTube  
- **SpoonFedStudy** – your *single motivational/mindset drip*. No clutter, no FOMO—just one slot.  
- Keeps company with your *thinking/AI lane* (D-Squared, Campbell, Vicky, Jason Hamilton).  

---

That keeps **RSS = deliberate reading** and **YouTube = watch-worthy only**, with zero overlap.  

Do you want me to lock this into a **final three-lane table (YT / RSS / Podcasts)** so you’ve got the whole ecosystem on one clean sheet?

---

**User:**

So. With my yt subs under control and only on my iPad, not iPhone… is it safe/sane to turn back on the algorithm?

---

**Assistant:**

Yes—with caveats. Turning the algorithm back on can actually work *for you* now, because you’ve decluttered the substrate it feeds on. But you need guardrails.  

---

## Why It’s Safer Now  
- **Input diet is lean.** Algorithm will be drawing from ~14 core channels, not 70. Less chance of garbage slipping in.  
- **Device containment.** iPad only = intentional use. No idle scroll on your iPhone “BlackBerry mode.”  
- **Clear role.** YouTube is *joy, spark, tools* — not your primary craft/learning feed.  

---

## Watchpoints  
- **Algorithm drift:** It will still suggest tangential junk (hot takes, “10 AI hacks that will blow your mind”). If you don’t click, it dies off.  
- **Time sink risk:** Recommendations can spiral. Use the rule of *“one rec click per session, max.”*  
- **Subscription priority:** Keep your Subscriptions tab as the *home base.* Algorithm only gets to suggest the occasional dessert.  

---

## Practical Guardrails  
- **Default view:** Always land on *Subscriptions* or *Library*, not Home.  
- **Click discipline:** If you click a recommended video, pause and ask, *“Does this align with my roster’s lanes?”*  
- **Nuke early:** Use “Not interested” aggressively to prune off-topic drift.  
- **Time box:** Treat YouTube as *one evening slot on iPad*—a planned “TV channel,” not background feed.  

---

### Verdict  
**Yes, it’s sane** to turn the algo back on under these conditions. The key is to treat it like seasoning, not the meal. Your subscriptions define the diet; the algo gets to throw you the occasional amuse-bouche.  

Want me to draft you a **“YouTube Discipline Pact”** (short checklist you can keep pinned in Notes) so you’ve got a personal rulebook for keeping the algorithm tamed?

---

**User:**

Hmmm maybe turn on watch history and leave search history off or does that really matter?

---

**Assistant:**

That distinction matters more than YouTube admits.  

### **Watch History ON, Search History OFF**  
- **Watch history ON**:  
  - Strengthens the algorithm *based on what you actually watch*.  
  - Lets Subscriptions + recommendations “learn” your lean roster.  
  - Essential if you want recs to stay tied to your curated channels.  

- **Search history OFF**:  
  - Prevents one-off curiosity searches (e.g., “how to fix dishwasher” or “weird rabbit hole at 1am”) from contaminating your recommendations.  
  - Keeps the algorithm focused on *subscriptions and watch patterns*, not random tangents.  

### Why This Combo Works for You  
- Your curated subs = a clean training set. Watch history keeps them front-and-center.  
- Search off = you can still look things up, but those won’t muddy your feed.  

---

## Verdict  
- **Turn watch history back ON.**  
- **Keep search history OFF.**  
- You get a tuned algorithm without the chaos of every random search echoing back at you.  

---

Want me to sketch a **tiny rulecard** (like 4 lines you can stick in Apple Notes) to remind yourself of this discipline whenever you open YT?

---

**User:**

I wish the algorithm could be tuned to subs only b

---

**Assistant:**

It basically can — you just have to *fake it*. YouTube doesn’t give you a “subs-only” algorithm switch, but with the right setup you can corral it into behaving that way.  

---

## How to “Subs-Only” the Algorithm  

1. **Subscriptions tab as home base**  
   - Make it muscle memory: open straight to *Subscriptions* or *Library*, never *Home*.  
   - On iPad, you can even add a Safari shortcut that drops you into the Subscriptions view.  

2. **Watch history = whitelist**  
   - Because you’ve pruned subs, your watch history will now be ~90% from them.  
   - That becomes the training set the algo works from.  

3. **Starve the junk**  
   - If you *must* click outside your subs, open it in a private browser or turn watch history off temporarily.  
   - Otherwise, the algo takes that one guilty-pleasure click and floods your feed with clones.  

4. **Use “Not interested” like a machete**  
   - Every off-topic suggestion, nuke it instantly. That negative feedback stacks quickly.  

---

## Net Effect  
The algo starts looking *a lot like a subs-only recommender*, because you’re feeding it only the channels you actually want. It’ll still sprinkle in “similar creators,” but those are easy to trim.  

---

So: **pruned subs + watch history ON + search history OFF + machete discipline = “subs-first” YouTube.**  

Want me to draft you a **4-line “Subs-Only Discipline Card”** you can pin in Apple Notes so you don’t even think about it?

---

**User:**

Hmm. I also need to avoid the save to watch later thing. That’s just another guilty invox

---

**Assistant:**

Exactly — *Watch Later* is just another inbox, and you’ve already built enough of those. It’s basically FOMO with a timestamp.  

---

## Why “Watch Later” Backfires  
- **Hoarding effect:** You keep videos you’ll never actually watch, and the list becomes clutter.  
- **Shadow subscriptions:** It sneaks in channels/voices you deliberately pruned.  
- **Inbox creep:** Now you’ve got Subscriptions, Feeds, Podcasts *and* a “Watch Later” backlog — breaks your lean design.  

---

## Cleaner Alternatives  
- **Immediate triage:** Either *watch it now* or *don’t*. No parking lot.  
- **Star system (Feeds/Notes):** If it’s *truly worth keeping*, save the link into your Feeds “Starred” or a single Apple Note. That keeps all durable saves in *one* place.  
- **Playlist discipline:** If you really want to corral a theme (say “AI experiments”), create a *named playlist*. At least then you’re intentional, not hoarding.  

---

## Practical Rule  
> **No “Watch Later.” Ever.**  
> *Watch it now, or harvest the link into Feeds/Notes if it deserves long-term value.*  

---

Want me to fold that into a **tiny “YouTube Discipline Pact” card** (subs-only, watch history on/search off, no Watch Later, one rec click max) so you’ve got the whole guardrail set in one glance?

---

**User:**

I have all my other Google activity tracking turned off. 

---

**Assistant:**

That’s the cleanest posture. Google’s cross-activity tracking is where the algorithm really bloats—pulling in your searches, maps history, ads clicks, etc., to “personalize” YouTube. With that off:  

- **YouTube trains only on itself** → watch history + subs.  
- **No bleed-over** from random searches, Gmail ads, or Maps queries.  
- **Simpler signal loop** → YouTube feels more like a bounded TV channel, not Google omniscience.  

So your stack now looks like this:  
- **Google Activity Tracking:** fully off.  
- **YouTube Search History:** off (no one-off queries polluting the feed).  
- **YouTube Watch History:** on (but pruned to your lean roster).  
- **Watch Later:** banned (no shadow inbox).  

That’s about as close as you can get to a *subs-only algorithm* without going full RSS-reader mode for video.  

Want me to distill all of this into a **YouTube Discipline Pact card** (4–5 lines you can pin in Notes) so the whole guardrail system is friction-free and in your face whenever you open it?

---

**User:**

Shorts are the real villain in the app. Need to avoid it like the plague. 

---

**Assistant:**

Yep — Shorts are the algorithm’s slot machine. Even if your subs are pristine, one swipe down that rabbit hole and you’ve handed the algo your attention for 30 minutes. They’re engineered for *interruption*, not depth.  

---

## How to Neuter Shorts

- **Never swipe.** Train yourself to treat the Shorts shelf like a pop-up ad.  
- **Block the surface:**  
  - In browser (Safari/Firefox/Brave), use `youtube.com/feed/subscriptions` → no Shorts shelf.  
  - On iPad app, long-press Shorts → “Not interested.” Repeat until the shelf starves.  
- **One-time discipline:** If a Short tempts you, copy the creator’s main channel → sub if they’re worth long-form, and ignore the Shorts.  
- **Language hack:** Say to yourself: *“That’s TikTok with worse lighting.”* It reframes Shorts as beneath your standards.  

---

## Pact Update

Your **YouTube Discipline Pact** now has 5 lines:  
1. **Subscriptions tab only.**  
2. **Watch history ON, search history OFF.**  
3. **No Watch Later.**  
4. **One rec click max per session.**  
5. **No Shorts, ever.**  

---

Do you want me to draft this pact as a **tight Apple Note card** you can drop into your “system manual” — something glanceable every time you open YT?

---

**User:**

Wow. The algo instantly put a bunch of political content in front of me. Sinister. 

---

**Assistant:**

That’s exactly the dark pattern: the moment you flip the algorithm back on, it tries to hook you with the highest-engagement bait it has—politics, outrage, celebrity drama. It’s not “personalization,” it’s **addiction testing**.  

---

## How to Starve That Beast Fast  
- **Immediate nuke:** Hit *“Not interested”* and *“Don’t recommend channel”* on every political clip, even if it’s mildly tempting. Treat it like spam.  
- **Reset lever:** If the flood feels overwhelming, clear your watch history (just the past day) and you’ll kill the infection before it takes root.  
- **Anchor the algo:** Watch a handful of videos from your *core roster* (Ramsey, Tale Foundry, Nolke, PMJ). That feeds it positive reinforcement of what you *do* want.  
- **No sampling:** Don’t click “just to see what it is.” One click = dozens more.

## Mental Model  
Think of the algo as a stray dog:  
- Feed it once with political junk → it camps at your door.  
- Never feed it, and it eventually wanders off to someone else.  

---

Want me to add a **line to your Discipline Pact** about “politics = auto-nuke” so you don’t even hesitate next time it tries to slide that in?

**User:**

I wish safari on macOS had an unhook extension like chromium. 

---

**Assistant:**

Yeah — Safari’s extension ecosystem is thin, and most of the “algorithm detox” tooling (Unhook, Distraction Free YouTube, etc.) lives in the Chromium world. But you can still hack Safari into a cleaner, almost-Unhook state:  

---

## Safari Workarounds  

1. **Subscriptions URL Bookmark**  
   - Bookmark **`https://www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions`**.  
   - Make it your *default YouTube entry point* — skips the Home algo entirely.  
   - On macOS you can even set this as the pinned tab / startup page.  

2. **Custom Style / Blocker**  
   - Use **StopTheMadness** or **1Blocker** (Safari extensions) to hide elements with CSS. Example rules:  
     - Hide Shorts shelf  
     - Hide Home feed  
     - Hide right-rail recommendations  
   - These give you 80% of what Unhook does.  

3. **Minimal Wrapper Apps**  
   - Open-source projects like **Invidious** or **FreeTube** (Electron app, though Chromium under the hood) — let you watch YouTube with zero algorithm clutter. You can set them as your default opener for YT links.  

4. **Safari Reader Mode Hack**  
   - Doesn’t work on the feed, but if you click a video → Reader mode nukes comments and sidebars instantly. One-click declutter.  

---

## Clean Discipline Flow (Mac)  
- Always launch into `/feed/subscriptions`.  
- Use StopTheMadness / 1Blocker to strip Shorts + Home.  
- Treat Reader Mode as your “panic button” if algo creep shows up.  

---

Would you like me to write you a **ready-to-paste CSS block** that hides Shorts, Home feed, and recs in Safari via 1Blocker/StopTheMadness? That’d give you a near-Unhook experience.

**User:**

Is mythcreants better as a blog to follow in rss or as a podcast?

---

**Assistant:**

Short answer: **Both formats offer unique value, but they serve different modes of consumption—and you already have a high-signal home for writing craft.**

---

##  Mythcreants: Blog vs. Podcast

### Blog (Written Content)
- Mythcreants is primarily an **online publication** with **deep blog posts** focused on storytelling craft in speculative fiction—covering POV, pacing, disability representation, and more. It also occasionally includes podcasts, but text is the core medium. citeturn0search5
- The blog format aligns with your **RSS signal-drip system**—scanable, referenceable, and non-disruptive.

### Podcast (Audio Content)
- They offer **The Mythcreant Podcast**, updated biweekly, specifically tailored for fantasy and science fiction storytellers. As of late August 2025, there have been over 100 episodes and counting. citeturn0search6turn0search16
- It delivers similar craft insight, narrative analysis, and occasional author interviews in an audio-first format—potentially more immersive but less skimmable.

##  What Fits Your System Better?

| Format       | Why It Works for You                            | Considerations                                 |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Blog (RSS)** | Perfect match—you’re already reading mythcreants in your blog-based craft lane. | High signal, minimal friction. No rivalry.      |
| **Podcast**   | Immersive option for deep listening—good if you want to absorb storytelling craft in long-form mode. | Adds another “audio lane” to manage; overlaps genre with your existing YT/story slots. |

---

###  Recommendation

Stick with the **Mythcreants blog in your RSS feed** as the main craft resource. The audio version is excellent quality, but adding it risks blurring your lane discipline—where **RSS = text-based craft & frameworks** and **YouTube = video tools, inspiration, joy**. No need to introduce another media lane unless you deeply want immersive writing podcasts.

Let me know if you want the podcast added to your **podcasts roster** for periodic rotation—or leave it as the backup voice in your text lane.

**User:**

I suppose with mythcreants posting podcast transcripts in their blog, I can extract value there by running it through ChatGPT if needed. 

---

**Assistant:**

Exactly — that’s the elegant play.  

- **Blog-first:** The transcripts land in RSS already, so you don’t need to juggle another medium.  
- **Extraction:** If a post feels dense, drop it into ChatGPT and ask for a structured outline, “lessons learned,” or even “compare to Story Engineering / Save the Cat.”  
- **Continuity:** Keeping it in text means you can archive, link, and re-surface insights in ZORA without hunting down timestamps.  

So Mythcreants = **RSS + ChatGPT post-processing**. You get the full depth of their craft discussions without adding podcast clutter to your listening lane.  

Want me to sketch a quick **workflow card** for how you’d process Mythcreants posts (scan → star → ChatGPT digest → ZORA)? That way it’s friction-free.

**User:**

Chatmerge?

**Assistant:**

Got it — here’s the **ChatMerge entry** for your Mythcreants setup:

<ChatMerge>  
  <Entry>  
    <Timestamp>2025-08-30T23:59:00-03:00</Timestamp>  
    <Canon>  
      <Item>Mythcreants is best followed as a blog in RSS; it already posts transcripts of its podcast episodes.</Item>  
      <Item>Text-first intake aligns with system discipline: RSS = craft/frameworks, YouTube = spark/joy/tools.</Item>  
      <Item>Transcripts can be processed in ChatGPT for structured outlines, distilled lessons, or cross-references to other frameworks (e.g., Save the Cat, Story Engineering).</Item>  
      <Item>This avoids adding podcast clutter to the listening lane while retaining access to full craft depth.</Item>  
    </Canon>  
    <Decisions>  
      <Item>Keep Mythcreants in RSS as primary writing-craft signal source.</Item>  
      <Item>Skip podcast subscription; use transcripts + ChatGPT extraction for deeper processing when needed.</Item>  
    </Decisions>  
    <OpenLoops>  
      <Item>Optional: define a workflow card for Mythcreants post-processing (scan → star → ChatGPT → ZORA note).</Item>

      <Item>Podcast subscription (duplicate content, breaks lane discipline).</Item>  
    </Discardables>  
  </Entry>  
</ChatMerge>

Do you want me to spin up that **workflow card** as the next step, so it’s codified alongside this merge?
