# Goat Barn Overview

## Structure Details
- **Dimensions**: 10' x 12' structure.
- **Internal Layout**: Includes a 4' x 6' stall for the goats. The structure is also designed to house a garden shed.
- **Lighting**: Equipped with an LED bulb in the corner on a timer (On: 03:00, Off: 16:00). This provides light during bad weather when the shutter must remain closed.
- **Storage**: Used for hay storage and all animal feed storage (including bins for ducks and other layers).

## Livestock: The Bonded Pair
- **Goat 1 (Brown)**: Pygmy / Nigerian Dwarf goat.
- **Goat 2 (White)**: Boer goat.
- **Notes**: 
    - They are a bonded pair, approximately four years old.
    - The Boer goat is undersized due to birthing issues as a kid.
    - They spend time in the back field when put outside.

## Planned Projects
- **Pasture**: A fenced-in pasture is planned for Spring/Summer 2026.
