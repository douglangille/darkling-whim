# Bunny Town Overview

## Location & Context
- **Name**: "Bunny Town"
- **Location**: Situated between the goat barn (aka "Kid Row") and a horse chestnut tree [file:12].

## Structure & Insulation
- **Construction**: Three hutches built from pallet wood (8–9' long, 3' deep) [file:11][file:15].
- **Insulation Strategy**: 
    - **Walls**: Double-layered wood with a lining of plastic shaving bags in between to act as a windbreak.
    - **Hides**: Each hutch features a 2' x 2' x 2' "house" section separated from the run by a small opening.
    - **Roofs**: Shingled roofs (identified as the weakest structural point requiring ongoing maintenance).
- **Winter Prep**: Two sides of the run are tarped during winter to reduce wind exposure; only the front remains open.

## Operations & Maintenance
- **Hydration**: Water checked twice daily (morning/night) to manage freezing in bowls.
- **Bedding**: Shavings are used as the primary bedding (straw is avoided to prevent mites).
- **Feeding**:
    - Standard rabbit pellets.
    - **Winter Enrichment**: Cardboard boxes (e.g., shoeboxes) stuffed with hay are provided inside the house section to act as insulated "hay-hides" and forage.
- **Summer Maintenance**: Frozen pop bottles are utilized during summer months for cooling.

## Resident Rabbits
- **Rocket**: White rabbit [file:10][file:14].
- **Penny**: Brown rabbit [file:16].
- **Flower**: Black rabbit [file:13].
- **Notes**: Residents are ~5 years old; no longer part of a breeding program.
