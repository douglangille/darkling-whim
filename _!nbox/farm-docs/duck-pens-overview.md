# Duckington Heights (Duck Pens Overview)

## Setup & Infrastructure
- **Name**: "Duckington Heights"
- **Pens**: Two 20' x 20' pens located side-by-side, allowing for social interaction through the fence [file:25].
- **Houses**: Two 4' x 4' structures.
- **Seasonal Management**: 
    - Pools removed for winter [file:21].
    - 3-4 gallon rubber buckets used for deep drinking water outside the houses (emptied nightly to prevent freezing and deter rodents).

## Operations & Maintenance
- **Bedding**: Utilizing a "hay-cycling" system where cast-off hay from the goat barn is repurposed as duck bedding and chicken nesting material.
- **Feeding**: 
    - Standard feed and water provided outdoors to maintain dry house interiors.
    - **Nightly Routine**: A handful of cracked corn is provided inside the house at the front door before lock-up. This encourages easy entry and provides metabolic warmth overnight.
- **Rodent Control**: 
    - Ongoing monitoring for holes in structures.
    - Planned repair for a hole in the Welsh Harlequin house to prevent rat entry.
    - Nightly water removal to eliminate rodent watering holes.

## Resident Ducks

### Pen 1: Pekin Ducks (Left Side)
- **Flock**: Two white Pekin ducks (one male, one female) [file:26].
- **Age**: Approximately five years old.

### Pen 2: Welsh Harlequin Ducks (Right Side)
- **Flock**: Four male Welsh Harlequin ducks [file:23].
- **Age**: Approximately one year old.

## Future Management Strategy
- **Flock Integration**: Long-term plan to merge all five ducks into a single house as the Pekins age.
- **Land Reclamation**: Reclaiming the second pen area for other farm uses post-merge.
