# Duck Pens Overview

## Setup & Infrastructure
- **Layout**: Two duck houses and pens situated side-by-side [file:25].
- **Seasonal Management**: Pools have been removed for the winter season. The raised platforms for the pools remain in the pens [file:21][file:24].

## Resident Ducks

### Pen 1: Pekin Ducks (Left Side)
- **Flock**: Two white Pekin ducks (one male, one female) [file:26].
- **Age**: Approximately five years old.

### Pen 2: Welsh Harlequin Ducks (Right Side)
- **Flock**: Four male Welsh Harlequin ducks [file:23].
- **Age**: Approximately one year old (or slightly less).

## Future Management Strategy
- **Flock Integration**: Due to the advancing age of the Pekin ducks (particularly the female), the long-term plan is to merge all five ducks into a single house.
- **Land Reclamation**: Once the flocks are merged, the land currently occupied by the second pen will be reclaimed for other farm uses.
