# Butt Nugget Palace (Chicken Coop & Run Overview)

## Structure Details
- **Name**: "Butt Nugget Palace"
- **Dimensions**: 4' x 8' x 4' high with a pitched roof [file:17].
- **Foundation**: Currently sits on 6-inch pallets (lowered for wind stability after previous structure blew over).
- **Layout Features**:
    - **Doors**: Chicken door (long wall) and large cleaning door (end) [file:17].
    - **Interior**: Water on raised platform; suspended food dish [file:18][file:19].
    - **Roosting**: Three 2x2 wooden roosts at 30"–36" high across the narrow side [file:18].

## Operations & Management
- **Lighting**: LED on timer (03:00–16:00), shared with Kid Row.
- **Winter Maintenance**:
    - **Water**: Checked twice daily (morning/evening); warm water ("Tea") provided on cold days. Rubber bowls are used for easy ice removal.
    - **Bedding**: "Deep Litter" style approach; shavings added weekly to keep surface dry during freezes; full clean-out during thaws.
    - **Wind Protection**: Planned plywood baffle/porch for the chicken door to reduce internal drafts.

## Livestock & Productivity
- **Flock**: 8 hens, 1 rooster (ages 2–4).
- **Tracking**: Annual productivity based on feed vs. eggs eaten/sold. 

## Known Challenges
- **Wind**: High wind area (Milford); structures must be low or heavily anchored.
- **Rodents**: Constant pressure due to neighboring dairy farm. 

## Future Design Goals (Walk-In Coop)
- **Rodent Proofing**: Use a "hardware cloth sandwich" (1/4" wire between floor layers) or a concrete/paver foundation.
- **Stability**: Use auger-style earth anchors to allow for a taller, walk-in structure without wind risk.
- **Maintenance**: Design for waist-height cleaning and integrated internal storage for feed bins.
