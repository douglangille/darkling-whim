**Date**: 2026-01-09, 8:56 PM - 10:06 PM AST
**Method**: Structured questioning to uncover true motivations and decision factors

---

## Core Insights Discovered

### The Brutal Truth
> "I'm not sure that being a CIO would make me proud outside of the status symbol that comes with it."

> "I would regret leaving the innovation work on the table undone [but] I don't think I would regret not being CIO if I got packaged out."

### What Would Make Career Feel Complete at 65-70?
**Not this**: "I proved I could be CIO even though I didn't love it"

**This**: "I created innovative programs and mentored great people and made a real impact on learning"

---

## Question 1: Gut Reaction to CIO Role

**Q**: When you imagine yourself in the CIO role, what's your immediate gut feeling?

**A**: Anxiety for sure. Sense of duty. "I know in my heart of hearts that I'm the best internal candidate for the gig." But feeling "forced" into it. Money will be good but loss of personal time will suck. The job itself doesn't scare me - it's about orchestration.

**Key Insight**: Leading with anxiety and duty, not excitement or desire.

---

## Question 2: What Happens If You Don't Pursue It?

**Q**: If you don't pursue this and Angela or RJ gets it, what happens to you practically and emotionally?

**A**: 
- "I'll stay in my same role and people who were below me will continue to move ahead of me"
- Risk of role being folded if fiscal circumstances worsen
- "Probably at jeopardy of being packaged out"
- Angela worst option - doesn't value innovation/dev side of role ("the reason I keep showing up")
- Marginalization risk
- "I'm 53 and clearly climbing my second mountain. If I can't make a difference now, I won't ever."

**Key Insight**: Fear of marginalization and missed opportunity to make impact. Age urgency factor.

---

## Question 3: Innovation Work vs. Executive Admin

**Q**: In CIO role, would you do innovation work or manage people who do it? What's the trade-off in personal time for writing/farm/creative work?

**A**:
- "I'd be giving up the individual contributor work for sure."
- Closest would be leveraging AI as thinking partner (like this conversation)
- People and budgets have been most of career - not managing budget now "has been nice"
- Campus management politics before but not executive level - "def a stretch skill"
- Extrovert with known people, introverted with unknowns
- **"Novel strategic thinking excites me. I'm ideas, schemes and strategy. Not big on implementation details."** - driven by ADHD tendencies

**Logistics Concern**:
- Wife works shift work part-time, one car
- Live 45 min outside Halifax in Milford  
- Longer days and more onsite likely required
- More about travel logistics than time commitment
- Would need to negotiate hybrid work arrangement (tough with Province's RTO push)

**Key Insight**: Giving up what energizes him (IC innovation work) for what drains him (implementation details). Logistics are real barrier.

---

## Question 4: Can You Lead Without Implementation Details?

**Q**: As CIO you'd need both strategy AND ensuring 100 people execute. How did you handle details as Regional IT Manager? Are Derek's direct reports strong enough executors?

**A**:
- Relied heavily on team for implementation
- Ethic: "Get out of the way and let my people cook. I'd orchestrate and provide air cover."
- Would roll up sleeves when needed in "hyper super mega focus mode"
- Derek isn't natural at detail implementation either (probably why he pursues senior roles)
- RJ, Ange, Lynn, Adrian, Andrew all very good - would lean on them harder to self-regulate
- **"I have no tolerance for babysitting or micromanaging. I need to trust them to cook and make some good food."**

**Key Insight**: Has proven model for leading through orchestration. Team is capable. This part could work.

---

## Question 5: What Happens to Innovation Work?

**Q**: Who takes over your current role? Will watching them do creative work while you're in budget meetings be enough?

**A**:
- Suspects RJ would absorb vacancy and repurpose it ("the risk of status quo")
- That would "probably be the right call"
- Elevating Shelley Hare on team as acting would be sensible, especially if able to expand with 4th person
- **"As for will it be enough? I have no idea."**

**Key Insight**: Doesn't know if watching others do the work he loves will satisfy him. Innovation role likely gets absorbed/changed.

---

## Question 6: What Energizes You vs. Drains You?

**Q**: Think about satisfying work days. On scale 1-10, how much of typical CIO week would energize vs. drain? Given ADHD, how long before it becomes boring routine?

**A**: 
**Activities that lift him up**:
- Presenting to others
- Scheming on initiatives (not details - "Yuck")
- Early skunkworks ideation
- Anytime in group strategizing and sharing ideas
- "Get a rush from solving crisis. Even if I'm not the doer. But the leader."

**Key Insight**: CIO role has SOME of this (exec strategy sessions, crisis leadership, presenting to board) but not much skunkworks ideation. Concern about boredom over time.

---

## Question 7: What's Your 5-7 Year Vision?

**Q**: If acting CIO works out, what happens next? What's your vision for next 5-7 years? This shapes your entire endgame at 53.

**A**: [Response got cut off - "the reason the term gig is attractive is..."]

---

## Question 7 (Continued): Why Term Gig is Attractive

**A**:
- **"The reason the term gig is attractive is it's a term."**
- Not sure would ever want to BE a CIO permanently
- Would never forgive self for not trying
- **Capstone to prove could do it** - "pretty much on point"
- Could retire in 2 years if sold farm and moved to tiny home (not realistic)
- Realistically won't retire until 65 (12 years away)
- Can't spend 12 years doing same IT management or innovation work without bringing "sense of craft and craftsmanship to make myself interested"
- Unlikely to leave college due to pension
- Has superannuation plan transferable to other orgs, but **NSCC is best org in that pension group**

**Key Insight**: Locked into NSCC for pension. Acting CIO attractive BECAUSE it's temporary - prove he can, then move on. But to what?

---

## Question 8: What Happens After Acting CIO Ends?

**Q**: After successful 6-12 month acting CIO tour, then what? Go back to current role? Find different senior role? Hope it becomes permanent? How does stepping back down affect credibility?

**A**:
- Going back to existing role "will feel [bad]" and not sure it's right thing
- But with expanded CIO skillset, might find **senior manager role** (managers reporting to him)
- Like Matt Taylor's role - Senior Manager of Centre for Teaching and Learning
- **Option C (permanent CIO) only happens if actually likes the gig**
- If takes acting CIO for 6 months and hates it or is terrible at it, that option gone
- **Actually found Dean role MORE appealing** - "something different and something I knew I could do and learn from"
- **"Lot more room for creativity in the Dean role than CIO"**
- **"My ADHD would enjoy the novelty of it all more so than the CIO"**

**Key Insight**: Dean role was actually MORE attractive due to creativity and novelty. CIO is duty, not desire.

---

## Question 9: Opportunity Cost of Acting CIO

**Q**: If you take acting CIO for 6-12 months, you're off the market for other opportunities. What if a Dean position or creative senior role opens up while you're stuck in CIO chair? Does NOT taking CIO actually free you up if Angela gets it?

**A**:
- **"If I was trapped in the CIO role and missed [an] opportunity I would be pretty pissed off with myself. Would definitely have regrets."**
- If didn't get CIO and Angela got it: **"Life would just suck so hard. Think I could work [but would] probably be actively looking for other roles even at risk of my pension."**
- If RJ got CIO: Could work with him. Would more likely be RJ's replacement - **senior manager of service delivery operations - "might be the best of both worlds"**
- Another whole [path] to consider
- Post-retirement vision: **Career coaching or "professional skunkworks for hire"**
- "Really enjoy leading other people and mentoring other people but also enjoy creative side"
- Not sure what retirement career looks like

**Key Insight**: Would regret being trapped in CIO if missed better opportunity. RJ getting CIO and Doug getting RJ's role might actually be ideal. Post-career vision is coaching/mentoring/creative strategy work.

---

## Question 10: What Are You Really Trying to Prove?

**Q**: You're framing CIO as duty and capstone. But if actual passion is mentoring, creative strategy, and skunkworks - why spend 6-12 months doing executive admin you don't want? What would make career feel "complete" at 65-70?

**A**:
- **"Creating innovative programs [and mentoring] great people and making a real impact on learning"** - that's what would make him proud
- **"I'm not sure that being a CIO would make me proud outside of the status symbol that comes with it."**

**Key Insight**: THE CORE ADMISSION. CIO is about status, not fulfillment. Considering role mostly out of fear (Angela, being packaged out, being passed over) rather than desire.

---

## Question 11: Testing the Fear

**Q**: If Angela guts your innovation work or you get packaged out in 2-3 years, would you regret not having been CIO? Or would you regret not having protected innovation work another way?

**A**:
- **"I don't think I would regret not being CIO if I got packaged out."**
- **"But I would regret leaving the innovation work on the table undone."**
- Open to exploring what a third path might look like

**Key Insight**: It's not about CIO role. It's about protecting innovation work and staying in the game.

---

## Question 12: How Secure Is Current Role Really?

**Q**: How immediate is the threat? What would make current role bulletproof? Is third path viable (aggressively securing innovation role while positioning for lateral senior moves)?

**A**:
- **LMS operational work**: Definitely stays but could be easily absorbed by another unit (Lynn Pace ran it before under her org)
- **Innovation/development work**: Always risky because it's about "strategic failing over and over"
- **"As long as I have support to continue to fail with intention in the interest of learning new technology [to] move organization forward, I'll always have a job"**
- **"But I need enough air cover so I can cook"**

**Key Insight**: Innovation work is precarious by design. Requires executive-level air cover to fail strategically.

---

## Question 13: Who Provides Air Cover in Each Scenario?

**Q**: Who gives you air cover now? What happens in each scenario?
- Scenario A: Derek stays as CIO
- Scenario B: You become acting CIO (but who DOES the innovation work?)
- Scenario C: RJ becomes CIO
- Scenario D: Angela becomes CIO (air cover evaporates)

**Q**: If innovation work requires CIO-level air cover and Derek is leaving regardless, isn't the work already doomed unless you or someone sympathetic becomes CIO? Or is there another executive who could champion it?

**A**: 
- **RJ could provide the right air cover**
- **Angela would not**
- Derek would if he stayed, but **not convinced Derek would stay if he didn't get swing at VP job**
- **"Pretty sure a new CIO is going to be a thing within the next 12 months anyway"**
- **"In my mind the only viable internal candidate that I could work with would be RJ"**
- Anyone else would be problematic
- No idea what external hire would bring

**Key Insight**: Derek is leaving regardless. RJ is the ONLY internal candidate Doug can work with who would provide air cover for innovation work. Angela would kill it. External hire is unknown variable.

---

## FINAL ANALYSIS

### The Reframed Question

The question is NOT: "Should I pursue acting CIO?"

The question IS: **"Given that Derek is leaving anyway and a new CIO is inevitable within 12 months, what's the best path to protect innovation work and position for ideal next role?"**

### The Three Viable Scenarios

**Scenario A: Doug Becomes Acting CIO**
- ✅ Protects innovation work (provides own air cover)
- ✅ Proves capability (capstone/status achieved)
- ✅ Money and executive experience
- ✅ Positions for senior manager roles afterward
- ❌ Gives up IC work he loves for 6-12 months
- ❌ Risk of being trapped if better opportunity emerges
- ❌ Logistics challenges (one car, 45 min commute, RTO pressure)
- ❌ May hate it or be mediocre at it
- ❌ Doing job for status/duty, not fulfillment

**Scenario B: RJ Becomes CIO, Doug Takes RJ's Role**
- ✅ RJ provides air cover for innovation work
- ✅ Senior Manager of Service Delivery Operations = "might be the best of both worlds"
- ✅ Managers reporting to Doug (growth from current 3 reports)
- ✅ More operational/strategic blend, less pure executive admin
- ✅ Stays available for Dean or other creative senior roles
- ✅ Better alignment with actual interests (mentoring, strategy, some IC work)
- ❌ Requires RJ to get CIO (not guaranteed)
- ❌ Still risk of external hire or Angela getting it
- ❌ May feel like "settling" for not pursuing CIO

**Scenario C: Angela or External Gets CIO**
- ❌ Innovation work likely gutted or deprioritized
- ❌ Doug marginalized or packaged out
- ❌ "Life would just suck so hard"
- ❌ Would be looking for other roles at risk of pension
- This is the scenario to AVOID

### The Strategic Calculation

**Key Facts:**
1. Derek leaving regardless = new CIO is happening
2. Only RJ provides acceptable air cover among internal candidates
3. Doug doesn't actually want to BE a CIO permanently
4. What Doug actually wants: innovation work + mentoring + eventual career coaching/skunkworks role
5. RJ's senior manager role might be "best of both worlds"
6. Doug is 53, locked into NSCC for pension (12 years to 65)

**The Risk Assessment:**
- If Doug DOESN'T pursue CIO and RJ gets it = IDEAL OUTCOME (innovation protected, Doug in RJ's role)
- If Doug DOESN'T pursue CIO and Angela/external gets it = WORST OUTCOME (innovation gutted, marginalized)
- If Doug DOES pursue and gets CIO = ACCEPTABLE OUTCOME (work protected, but doing job he doesn't want)
- If Doug DOES pursue and doesn't get it = depends who does (RJ = fine, Angela/external = bad)

### The Missing Intelligence

**Critical questions that change everything:**

1. **What is RJ's actual interest in CIO role?** 
   - If RJ wants it badly = don't compete, support him
   - If RJ ambivalent = Doug becomes default internal candidate

2. **What is Anna Burke's preference?**
   - Does she want internal continuity or external fresh perspective?
   - Who does she see as Derek's natural successor?

3. **How strong is Angela's candidacy really?**
   - Is she actually interested?
   - Does she have executive support?

4. **What is timeline and process?**
   - Internal appointment or posted position?
   - When does Derek officially move?

---

## RECOMMENDATION

### Immediate Action: Intelligence Gathering (Next 7 Days)

**Before making ANY decision about pursuing CIO, you MUST answer these questions:**

1. **Have direct conversation with RJ** (casual, colleague to colleague):
   - "Derek's likely pursuing VP role. Have you thought about the CIO opportunity?"
   - Gauge his genuine interest level
   - If he wants it: gauge whether he'd value your support
   - If he's ambivalent: understand why

2. **Have strategic conversation with Derek** (mentor to mentee):
   - Confirm his VP timeline and likelihood
   - Ask his perspective on CIO succession
   - Gauge whether he'd advocate for you vs. RJ vs. external
   - Understand Anna's thinking if he knows

3. **Read Anna Burke's priorities**:
   - What are her immediate challenges as Acting President?
   - Does she want continuity or change in CIO role?
   - Is there way to have indirect conversation about IT leadership needs?

### Decision Framework (Week 2)

**IF RJ clearly wants CIO and would provide air cover:**
- **DON'T pursue CIO**
- Position for RJ's senior manager role
- Support RJ's candidacy
- This gets you innovation protection + better role fit + stay available for Dean roles

**IF RJ is ambivalent or doesn't want CIO:**
- **DO pursue acting CIO**
- You become default internal candidate
- Frame as temporary leadership during transition
- Negotiate hybrid arrangement upfront
- Plan exit strategy to senior manager role after 6-12 months
- This is duty/capstone path but protects work

**IF Angela is strong candidate with exec support:**
- **DO pursue acting CIO aggressively**
- This becomes defensive move to prevent worst outcome
- Rally support from stakeholders
- Position as continuity/stability candidate
- Accept this means giving up IC work to save innovation function

**IF external hire is likely regardless:**
- **DON'T pursue CIO**
- Focus on making innovation work bulletproof with documentation/results
- Position as valuable #2 to incoming CIO
- Stay available for lateral senior opportunities
- Build relationship with new CIO to secure air cover

### The "Third Path" (If RJ Gets CIO)

**This might actually be your BEST outcome:**

1. RJ becomes CIO (provides air cover you need)
2. Doug takes RJ's senior manager role (growth + better fit)
3. Innovation work protected under RJ's leadership
4. Doug gets:
   - Strategic/operational blend work (more interesting than pure exec admin)
   - Mentoring opportunities (managers reporting to him)
   - Some proximity to innovation work
   - Stays available for Dean or other creative senior roles when they arise
   - Better work-life logistics
   - Alignment with actual interests and retirement career vision

**This is the "best of both worlds" you mentioned.**

---

## FINAL VERDICT

**You have enough information to recommend a course of action, but you need ONE WEEK of intelligence gathering first.**

**The recommendation depends entirely on RJ's interest level:**

- **RJ wants CIO** = Support him, position for his role = BEST OUTCOME
- **RJ doesn't want CIO** = Pursue acting CIO yourself = NECESSARY DUTY
- **Angela strong candidate** = Pursue CIO aggressively = DEFENSIVE MOVE

**Your next action is NOT to decide about CIO. Your next action is to have coffee with RJ.**

That conversation determines everything.
