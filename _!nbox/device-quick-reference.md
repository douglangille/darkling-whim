### Perplexity Access
Web only (no app) - enforces intentional use for reports/podcasts

### Reading Theme Settings
**Unified across all apps**:

**feeeed**:
- Title font: Iowan
- Body font: Iowan
- Size: 175%
- Theme: Warm
- Brightness: Auto

**Apple Books**:
- Font: Serif (closest to Iowan)
- Theme: Sepia
- Size: Match 175% visual density
- Justification: On
- Line spacing: Normal/Medium

**Safari Reader**:
- Font: Serif
- Background: Sepia/warm
- Size: Match other apps visually

**Goal**: Consistent reading experience across all apps reduces cognitive load

### Usage Patterns
- Intentional YouTube (not reflexive phone scrolling)
- feeeed for RSS - use built-in summary, only promote to LLM if truly valuable
- Books for long-form, sideloaded content
- Light Office work when not at MacBook
- Perplexity web for consuming Labs outputs (podcasts, reports)

## MacBook Air M1 (macOS 26.2)
**Role**: Creation Workhorse

### Core Tools
```
AI/Writing:
- Perplexity Pro (web) + GitHub MCP
- Writing Studio Space

Development:
- VSCode
- GitHub repos (local + web)

Library Management:
- Calibre (ebook catalog, epub → PDF conversion)

Ephemeral Notes:
- Apple Notes (capture only, not archive)
```

### Perplexity Configuration
**Writing Studio Space**:
- GitHub MCP connected
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 default
- Bootstrap file loaded
- Sources: None (toggle Web as needed)

**Labs Projects**:
- Podcast scripts from repos
- Deep Research reports
- Asset generation (charts, documents)

### MCP Workflows
```
Example queries in Writing Studio:
- "Find all stories tagged 'Haley'"
- "Concatenate fiction files into one markdown"
- "Generate blog post ideas based on recent commits"
- "Create style guide from existing posts"
```

### Calibre Workflow
1. Import epubs/PDFs to library
2. Convert epub → PDF (for LLM ingestion)
3. Sync to iPad Books via USB or cloud
4. Use for long-form reading on iPad

### Usage Patterns
- All serious writing/brainstorming
- GitHub repo management
- Perplexity MCP queries
- Labs project generation
- Quarterly planning threads
- No distractions - work-focused device

## Cross-Device Workflows

### Dictation → Structure → Action
1. **iPhone**: Dictate thought/reflection to Perplexity
2. **Read**: AI-structured response
3. **Decide**: Actionable? → Reminders; Reference? → ignore/save
4. **Process = value** (no artifact guilt)

### Research → Read → Consume
1. **MacBook**: Deep Research or Labs report in Perplexity
2. **Sync**: Threads auto-sync across devices
3. **iPad**: Read report in Perplexity web (structured output)
4. **Listen**: If podcast script, export to NotebookLM → audio → Spotify

### Writing → Revision → Publish
1. **MacBook Writing Studio**: Draft in Perplexity with MCP context
2. **Iterate**: Multiple threads with Claude Sonnet 4.5
3. **Export**: Commit to GitHub via MCP or manual paste
4. **Review**: Read on iPad Books (if long-form) for final pass

### Capture → Process → Archive
1. **iPhone Safari**: Find article → share to Apple Notes
2. **MacBook**: Open Notes → paste to Perplexity for analysis
3. **Action**: Extract insights, no need to "file" article
4. **Delete**: Note after processing (ephemeral only)

## Device Maintenance

### iPhone
- Review installed apps quarterly
- Delete unused apps immediately
- Keep home screen minimal
- Safari = emergency backdoor only

### iPad
- Review reading apps for theme consistency
- Check for unused productivity apps
- YouTube in check (intentional, not habit)
- No Perplexity app (web enforces boundaries)

### MacBook
- Keep desktop clear
- Calibre library organized
- GitHub repos up to date
- Perplexity Spaces reviewed quarterly

## When Something Feels Wrong

**Too much phone scrolling?**
→ Check: did YouTube or other distraction app creep back?

**Guilt about unused apps?**
→ Delete immediately, no "I might use it someday"

**Reading feels inconsistent?**
→ Check theme settings: serif, sepia, 175% across all

**AI relationship feels weird?**
→ Switch from interactive voice to dictation only

**Too many Perplexity threads?**
→ Prune old threads, no need to archive (process > artifact)

**Overwhelmed by tools?**
→ Return to: Perplexity Pro + (NotebookLM for podcasts only)
