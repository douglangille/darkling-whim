# ADHD-Optimized Display Strategy

## Why This Matters for ADHD Brains

### The Consistency Paradox
- **Common assumption:** "Everything should be the same for consistency"
- **Reality:** ADHD brains benefit from *intentional* patterns, not rigid uniformity
- **Solution:** Context-dependent rules that become automatic (reduce decision friction)

### Decision Fatigue & Visual Environment
- Every mode switch = cognitive overhead
- Visual inconsistency → working memory drain
- Predictable rules → automatic behavior → preserved cognitive resources

### Light Sensitivity (69% of ADHD)
- Linked to dopamine/melatonin regulation in eyes
- **Not solved by dark mode alone**
- Requires environmental design + screen settings

## Core Strategy: Visual Rhythm Zones

### Zone 1: Focused Work (Office Desk)
**Environment:**
- Well-lit with warm overhead bulbs (2700K)
- Controlled lighting (no harsh fluorescents)
- Consistent setup every session

**Devices:**
- MacBook: Light mode always
- External display: Light mode always
- Rationale: Maximum clarity for knowledge work; lighting consistency signals "work mode" to brain

**Why it works:**
- Reduces mode-switching decisions
- Light + warm environment = optimal clarity without harsh stimulation
- Predictable visual environment = lower cognitive load

### Zone 2: Mobile Productivity (MacBook Away from Desk)
**Environment:**
- Variable lighting (coffee shops, library, home)
- Must be intentionally well-lit or brightness adjusted

**Devices:**
- MacBook: Light mode always
- Brightness: Adjust to 30-40% in dim spaces
- Night Shift handles evening warmth automatically

**Why it works:**
- Maintains consistency with Zone 1 (office mode)
- No mode-switching decision when transitioning
- Clear rule: "MacBook = light mode, adjust brightness only"

### Zone 3: Consumption & Evening (iPad/iPhone)
**Environment:**
- Variable and often dim (couch, bed, low-light rooms)
- Less control over lighting

**Devices:**
- iPad: Auto dark mode + Clear icons
- iPhone: Auto dark mode + full-color icons
- Both: Night Shift on default schedule

**Why it works:**
- Auto mode = zero decisions required
- Dark mode appropriate for consumption in variable lighting
- Clear icons (iPad) reduce visual noise for calm consumption
- Full-color icons (iPhone) maintain speed for quick tasks

### Zone 4: Pre-Sleep (Minimal Use)
**Environment:**
- Dim lighting, warm lamps only

**Devices:**
- All: Dark mode + Night Shift + 30% brightness max
- Reduce White Point toggle if needed

**Why it works:**
- Consistent across all devices = simple rule
- Minimal screen time goal = less complexity needed
- Visual consistency signals "winding down" to brain

## Implementation: Making It Automatic

### Step 1: Set Device Defaults (One-Time Setup)
**MacBook:**
- System Settings > Appearance > Light
- Display Settings > Night Shift > Schedule: Sunset to Sunrise
- Display Settings > True Tone > On (optional)

**iPhone:**
- Settings > Display & Brightness > Automatic (set to schedule)
- Settings > Display & Brightness > Night Shift > Schedule: Sunset to Sunrise
- Settings > Accessibility > Display > Reduce White Point > Add to triple-click

**iPad:**
- Settings > Display & Brightness > Automatic (set to schedule)
- Settings > Home Screen > Customize > Clear (Auto)
- Settings > Display & Brightness > Night Shift > Schedule: Sunset to Sunrise
- Settings > Accessibility > Shortcuts > Triple-click > Reduce White Point

### Step 2: Environment Setup
**Office desk:**
- Replace daylight bulbs with warm 2700K bulbs
- Ensure even overhead lighting (no harsh spots)
- Optional: Warm desk lamp for evening work

**Mobile spaces:**
- Identify well-lit locations for productive work
- If working in dim space, set rule: "Reduce brightness, don't switch mode"

### Step 3: Establish Time-Based Rules
**Morning (7 AM - 6 PM):**
- All devices follow auto/light settings
- Office = MacBook at desk in light mode
- Mobile = MacBook in well-lit spaces

**Evening (6 PM - 11 PM):**
- Night Shift activates automatically
- MacBook stays light mode (warmth from Night Shift sufficient)
- iPad/iPhone in auto dark mode

**Night (11 PM+):**
- Minimize screen use
- All devices in dark + Night Shift if used
- Reduce White Point toggle as needed

### Step 4: Remove Decision Points
**What NOT to do:**
- Don't manually toggle modes throughout the day
- Don't switch based on "feeling" (creates decision fatigue)
- Don't add complexity (no extra extensions/apps)

**What TO do:**
- Trust the automatic schedule
- Adjust brightness only (preserve mode consistency)
- Use triple-click shortcuts for edge cases (not regular use)

## Troubleshooting ADHD-Specific Issues

### "I keep second-guessing my mode choice"
**Solution:** This is decision fatigue. Your rules are:
- MacBook = always light
- iPhone/iPad = auto
- No exceptions for 2 weeks (test period)

After 2 weeks, the habit becomes automatic and second-guessing disappears.

### "Bright websites at night feel jarring"
**Solution (iPhone):**
- Default: Use Reader Mode (strips away site design)
- Fallback: Dark Night extension for sites without Reader Mode
- Emergency: Reduce White Point triple-click

**Solution (MacBook):**
- Night Shift warmth sufficient for most sites
- If still jarring, reduce brightness (not mode)
- Consider this a signal to wind down screen time

### "I feel like I should optimize more"
**Solution:** This is ADHD optimization paralysis. You have an evidence-based system. More complexity = more decisions = higher cognitive load.

**Resist the urge to:**
- Add more extensions
- Create more granular rules
- Constantly adjust settings

**Trust the system for 3-4 weeks.** Track metrics (eye comfort, sleep, focus duration) but don't optimize daily.

### "I want everything to match visually"
**Solution:** Reframe "matching" as "intentional."
- Your MacBook (light) intentionally matches focused work
- Your iPad/iPhone (auto dark) intentionally matches consumption/communication
- This *is* consistency—context-driven, not appearance-driven

ADHD brains benefit from **meaningful patterns**, not arbitrary uniformity.

## Monitoring Your Setup (Week-by-Week)

### Week 1: Trust the Defaults
- Don't adjust anything
- Track subjective comfort only
- Note any friction points (write them down, don't act yet)

### Week 2: Assess Patterns
- Review friction points from Week 1
- Are they time-of-day specific? Device-specific? Environment-specific?
- Make ONE adjustment maximum (e.g., add triple-click shortcut)

### Week 3: Stability Testing
- No changes this week
- Monitor: Eye comfort, sleep quality, focus duration, decision fatigue
- Goal: System should feel automatic now

### Week 4: Final Optimization
- Review all metrics
- Make up to TWO refinements if needed
- Lock in final settings and commit to them for 3 months

## Success Metrics for ADHD Implementation

✅ **Reduced decision fatigue:** You don't think about mode choice anymore
✅ **Automatic behavior:** Device mode matches context without conscious thought
✅ **Lower cognitive load:** Visual environment feels predictable and calm
✅ **Better focus duration:** Clarity supports sustained work sessions
✅ **Improved sleep:** Evening screen use doesn't disrupt wind-down routine

## Red Flags (Signs to Adjust)

🚩 **Constantly toggling modes:** System too rigid or rules unclear
🚩 **Eye strain increasing:** Brightness management needed, not mode change
🚩 **Sleep worsening:** Reduce evening screen time (not mode issue)
🚩 **Decision paralysis about settings:** Too much complexity—simplify

## Final ADHD-Friendly Reminder

**Your goal is NOT perfection.**
Your goal is a sustainable system that:
- Reduces decision points
- Matches your actual usage patterns
- Feels automatic after 2-3 weeks
- Preserves cognitive resources for work that matters

This system is intentional, evidence-based, and optimized for ADHD brains. Trust it.
