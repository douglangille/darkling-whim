# Strategy: Rebuilding Intimacy (AuDHD Context & 30-Year History)

## 1. The Sensory Approach (The "How")
* **Deep Pressure / "Heavy Work":** Use slow, firm, rhythmic strokes (massages). Avoid light, ticklish, or "fidgety" touch, which can be overstimulating or "prickly" for autistic/ADHD brains.
* **Mindful Tactile Grounding:** When ED anxiety starts, redirect focus entirely to the texture, warmth, and resistance of her skin. Shift from "spectator" (watching yourself) to "participant" (sensing her).
* **Responsive Arousal:** Acknowledge that for many ND individuals, arousal doesn't start in the mind; it starts in the body. Touch is the "ignition," not the "result."

## 2. Managing the Emotional History (The "Safety")
* **Safety Data Deposits:** Use touch with zero strings attached. Every massage that *doesn't* end in sex is a "deposit" into her safety bank, proving you aren't "using" kindness as a transaction.
* **The "Opt-Out" Clause:** Vocalize the exit strategy upfront: *"I’d love to rub your feet. If it leads somewhere, cool; if we just relax and watch TV, that’s also a win."* This kills ADHD Demand Avoidance.
* **Remove PIV from the Table:** Explicitly decide that intercourse is not the goal. This removes the "pass/fail" pressure of ED and allows you to enjoy outercourse or manual play without performance anxiety.

## 3. Neurodivergent Logistics (The "Timing")
* **The Medication Window:** Initiate when ADHD meds are in their "peak focus" window (late morning or early evening). Avoid initiation during the "med crash" when sensory overload and irritability are highest.
* **Transition Time:** ADHD brains struggle with "task switching." Don't jump straight to sex; use a "bridge" activity (parallel play, a shared show, or long-form massage) to help her brain transition from "daily life" to "intimacy."

## 4. The Meta-Communication
* **Talk at "Neutral" Times:** Discuss these strategies while fully dressed and out of the bedroom. 
* **Body Neutrality:** Treat your ED as a technical glitch, not a moral or masculine failure. If it happens, pivot to other forms of pleasure without making it a "big deal" that kills the mood.
