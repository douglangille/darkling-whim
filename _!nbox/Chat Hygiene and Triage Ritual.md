Title: Chat Hygiene and Triage Ritual

## Problems Addressed

- One-off chats accumulating with no long-term value
- High-value insights buried inside sprawling, off-topic threads
- Decision paralysis about whether to keep or delete old conversations

## Principles

1. **Default to deletion** for one-off or low-value chats.
2. **Extract before you archive**: only save cleaned summaries or focused excerpts.
3. **Use tool boundaries**: phone/iPad = disposable, Mac = archival.

## Weekly Triage Ritual

1. Review recent Perplexity threads used for real work.
2. For any rambling or multi-topic thread:
   - Skim for genuinely useful insights, decisions, or workflows.
   - Generate a concise, structured summary or extract key sections into a new focused thread.
3. Export the cleaned summary as Markdown and commit it to the `!nbox` folder in the workbench repo with a date-and-title filename (e.g., `YYYYMMDD_Topic.md`). [web:11][memory:24]
4. Mark the original sprawling thread as “processed” (mentally or via naming) and stop revisiting it.

## Naming Convention

Use a consistent filename pattern for archived summaries:

- `YYYYMMDD_Context-Tool-Topic.md`
  - Example: `20251229_AI-Stack-Architecture.md`

This reinforces the idea that there is no obligation to preserve whole chats—only the extracted value.
