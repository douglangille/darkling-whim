<P></P><P><A href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/customer_service">Why I’d rather be punched in the testicles than call customer service - The Oatmeal</A></P>
<P>I had an experience this week in craptacular customer service. It’s good to see The Oatmeal has my back.</P>
<P>I went to add minutes to my daughter’s pre-paid phone after supper one night last week — Bell Mobility if you’re interested.</P>
<P>Since I had previously setup web access to the account, that was where I started. I logged in and picked her number from the menu. I waited patiently for the progress indicator to indicate something besides “please wait”.&nbsp; I was presented a screen that said it could not find anything about the phone in question (you know, the one I selected from a pick list). I was directed to dial #321 from the phone to proceed.</P>
<P>Ok. Fine.</P>
<P>I gleefully did as was suggested and the voice menu offered that I should press 1 to report a stolen or lost phone (note that I called #321 from said phone, so…&nbsp;I dunno) or to wait while they searched my account.</P>
<P>After waiting for a while, I was informed that the customer service hours were now closed and that I could dial #321 to top up my phone 24/7.</P>
<P>I was then disconnected.</P>
<P>OK. Fine.</P>
<P>I decided to head to the phone kiosk at the grocery store to see if I could get them to top up the phone. I explained the situation. They readily took my money and clicked a few keys on their computer. The printer spit out a receipt.</P>
<P>I was hopeful.</P>
<P>The clerk then handed me the paper with a number circled and directed me to call in to have the top up activated. The number?&nbsp;#321.</P>
<P>I reminded the clerk of my plight and they said this was the only way to activate the top up.</P>
<P>Ok. Fine.</P>
<P>I asked, very politely, to whom I would register my complaint concerning Bell Mobility’s customer service. The clerk said I would have to call…</P>
<P>#321</P><P></P>

<P>There was an old woman in Woodbridge there was<BR>So proper and tidy and all of them things<BR>She would wander all day with her duster in hand <BR>She was one of those women who clean where they stand.<BR>And while she is at it she sings, boys, <BR>And while she is at it she sings.<BR>(and you sing too)</P>
<P>Now there’s no doubt about it her house is a show<BR>With everything proper and stowed in&nbsp; it’s place <BR>And that’s why her dustbins had a shed of their own<BR>Like a mirror each one of those bins, it had grown.<BR>You could read every line in your face, boys,<BR>You could read every line in your face.</P>
<P>Now there’s nothing the matter with tiddiness, no.<BR>No matter with keeping your house up to scratch<BR>But these bins were located one side of a yard<BR>Where a Doberman Pinscher was prowling on guard.<BR>Trained to kill if you lifted the latch, boys,<BR>Trained to kill if you lifted the latch.</P>
<P>Now it’s all very well to protect what is yours <BR>And it’s better not leaving temptation around<BR>But a job of the dust is rewarding enough <BR>And there’s nothing like taking the smooth with the rough.<BR>To be savaged by some bloody hound, boys,<BR>To be savaged by some bloody hound.</P>
<P>Now this Doberman Pinscher would play in the yard <BR>And a couple of old tennis balls was his game<BR>In his make believe game it’s himself that he saw<BR>As the worlds only dog with a bionic jaw. (grrr)<BR>And that’s when the garbage man came, boys,<BR>And that’s when the garbage man came.</P>
<P>Now fate took a hand on this coldest of days<BR>For his wife she had made him to wear a warm coat<BR>And to knot up his muffler to keep out the chill<BR>And for once in his life he had bent to her will.<BR>And the dog couldn’t get at his throat, boys,<BR>And the dog couldn’t get at his throat.</P>
<P>Now when the woman above was drawn to the noise<BR>It’s down from a high chamber window she calls<BR>To the dustman engaged in a stuggle for life<BR>In a middle class tone you could cut with a knife<BR>She loudly exclaimed “kick his balls,” boys,<BR>She loudly exclaimed “kick his balls.”</P>
<P>Now the dustman could scarcely believe the command<BR>But he didn’t have time to request it again<BR>So ignoring distinctions of language and class<BR>He unleashed as size ten on the Dobermans ass.<BR>And it’s eyes misted over with pain, boys<BR>And it’s eyes misted over with pain.</P>
<P>Now imagine the silence that followed that blow (yelp)<BR>With the comand the ringing&nbsp; on in the poor dustmans ears<BR>And as the poor doggie lay writhing around <BR>You could see the two tennis balls there on the ground.<BR>And her meaning was rendered quite clear, boys, <BR>And her meaning was rendered quite clear.</P>
<P>Now I’d like to explain that this dog was at stud<BR>And the dustman was sued for the fees that he’d lost <BR>But it’s lucky he was to escape with his life<BR>He went home with a kiss for his poor startled wife.<BR>Who harangued him for what it might cost, boys<BR>Who harangued him for what it might cost</P>
<P>Now, if there’s a moral to be gained from this song<BR>It’s that innocent language might sometimes sound crude<BR>And as in the case of the carpenters mate <BR>You linguistic inlightenment might arrive late.<BR>And you could end up getting screwed, boys, <BR>And you could end up getting screwed.</P><BR><FONT size="2"> [ Posted <A href="http://stream.douglangille.ca/post/243282989"> Fri, 13 Nov 2009 23:41:21</A> ]</FONT>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These calculations suggest a few other hacks. Guys: if you enter a bathroom with an awkward number of vacant urinals in a row, rather than taking one of the end ones, you can take one a third of the way down the line. This will break the awkward row into two optimal rows, turning a worst-case scenario into a best-case one. On the other hand, say you want to create awkwardness. If the bathroom has an unawkward number of urinals, you can pick one a third of the way in, transforming an optimal row into two awkward rows.</P>

<H2>I’m a man of many handles, pardner. There’s some that call me Jimmy, and some that call me Timmy; some that call me Handy and some that call me Dandy. They can call me Loser, or they can call me Winner, just as long as they don’t call me in too late for dinner. I have been called the Ageless Stranger. I have also been called Merlin or Maerlyn — and who cares, because I was never that one, although I never denied it, either. I am sometimes called the Magician… or the Wizard… but I hope we can go forward together on more humble terms. More human terms. Call me Fannin. Richard Fannin. That’s not exactly right, maybe, but I reckon it’s close enough for government work. What do you say, pard? Shake the hand that shook the world.<BR>

<P></P><P>A curious fellow died one day and found himself waiting in the long line of judgment.

As he stood there he noticed that some souls were allowed to march right through the pearly gates into Heaven.

Others though, were led over to Satan who threw them into the burning pit.

But every so often, instead of hurling a poor soul into the fire, Satan would toss a soul off to one side into a small pile.

Watching Satan do this several times, the fellow’s curiosity got the best of him.

So he strolled over and asked Satan what he was doing.

“Excuse me, Mr. Prince of Darkness,” he said. “I’m waiting in line for judgment, but I couldn’t help wondering, why are you tossing those people aside instead of flinging them into the Fires of Hell with the others?”

“Ah, those,” Satan said with a groan. “They’re all from Nova Scotia …

They’re still too wet to burn.”

(Thanks Christine!) </P><P></P>

<P></P><BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Data centers worldwide now consume more energy annually than Sweden. And the amount of energy required is growing, says Jonathan Koomey, a scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. From 2000 to 2005, the aggregate electricity use by data centers doubled. The cloud, he calculates, consumes 1 to 2 percent of the world's electricity.</P>
<P>Much of this is due simply to growth in the number of servers and the Internet itself. A Google search is not without environmental consequence â€” 0.2 grams of CO2 per search, the company claims â€” but based on E.P.A. assumptions, an average car trip to the library consumes some 4,500 times the energy of a Google search while a page of newsprint uses some 350 times more energy. Data centers, however, are loaded with inefficiencies, including loss of power as it is distributed through the system. It has historically taken nearly as much wattage to cool the servers as it does to run them. Many servers are simply ...comatose.“ ...Ten to 30 percent of servers are just sitting there doing nothing,“ Koomey says. ...Somebody in some department had a server doing this unique thing for a while and then stopped using it.“ Because of the complexity of the network architecture â€” in which the role of any one server might not be clear or may have simply been forgotten â€” turning off a server can create more problems (e.g., service outages) than simply leaving it on.</P>
<P>As servers become more powerful, more kilowatts are needed to run and cool them; square footage in data centers is eaten up not by servers but by power. As data centers grow to unprecedented scales â€” Google recently reported that one of its data centers holds more than 45,000 servers (only a handful of companies have that many total servers) â€” attention has shifted to making servers less energy intensive. One approach is to improve the flow of air in the data center, through computational fluid-dynamics modeling. ...Each of these servers could take input air at about 80 degrees,“ John Sontag, director of the technology transfer office at <A href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/hewlett_packard_corporation/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More information about Hewlett-Packard Corporation">Hewlett-Packard</A>, told me as we walked through the company's research lab in Palo Alto. ...The reason why you run it at 57 is you're not actually sure you can deliver cold air“ everywhere it is needed. Chandrakant Patel, director of the Sustainable I.T. Ecosystem Lab at H.P., argues there has been ...gross overprovisioning“ of cooling in data centers. ...Why should all the air-conditioners run full time in the data center?“ he asks. ...They should be turned down based on the need.“</P>
<P>Power looms larger than space in the data center's future â€” the data-center group Afcom predicts that in the next five years, more than 90 percent of companies' data centers will be interrupted at least once because of power constrictions. As James Hamilton of Amazon Web Services observed recently at a Google-hosted data-center-efficiency summit, there is no Moore's Law for power â€” while servers become progressively more powerful (and cheaper to deploy) and software boosts server productivity, the cost of energy (as well as water, needed for cooling) stays constant or rises. Uptime's Brill notes that while it once took 30 to 50 years for electricity costs to match the cost of the server itself, the electricity on a low-end server will now exceed the server cost itself in less than four years â€” which is why the geography of the cloud has migrated to lower-rate areas.</P>

<P>This is me losing horribly, as usual, at <A href="http://www.criticalthoughtgames.com/Welcome.html">geoDefense</A>.</P>
<P>It's a fixed-path tower-defense game (the path is predetermined in each level and you just build towers around it â€” you don't make your own maze freely like you do in <I>Desktop Tower Defense</I> or <I>Fieldrunners</I>).</P>
<P>It's gorgeous, with warping and bouncing wireframes fluidly exploding all over the battlefield. And it's <B>hard</B>. I beat every Easy level, but on Medium, I'm only able to beat the first one (...Speed Round“). This one, pictured, is ...Sneaky Snake!“, the level most likely to at least guarantee the quickest death. (I still can't figure out exactly how anyone's supposed to beat it. I've tried lots of low-level towers, a few high-level towers, different kinds of towersâ€¦ nothing lasts more than 6 waves.)</P>
<P>The game's frustratingly difficult and it drives me crazy. Yet, I keep playing. If you like incredibly difficult, fast-paced tower defense games, give it a try.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>I wrote this song after I ran into an ex boyfriend of mine at a lower east side bar, and he was with this girl. I really had no reason to be pissed off at all, we weren't dating anymoreâ€¦but it still bothered me. She was this skinny (looking like she needed a sandwich real bad) modelesque hipster chick and I just really did not want to see them making out at the bar. So I left..and a few days later I thought that it might be a funny song to write, and that's where this song comes from. An ode to hipsters everywhere.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>Internet Explorer doomed to the Enterprise Ghetto? Perhaps.<BR>
<FONT size="2"> [ Posted <A href="http://stream.douglangille.ca/post/82981120"> Mon, 02 Mar 2009 20:09:00</A> ]</FONT>
</H2>
<P></P><P>Marco&nbsp;<A href="http://www.marco.org/82950480">responded</A>&nbsp;very thoughtfully to my <A href="http://blog.douglangille.ca/post/82658575/no-love-for-internet-explorer-with-instapaper">rant</A>&nbsp;on the web apps dropping support for IE. I understand the rationale and the compromises that have to be made to keep development moving forward.</P>
<P>I’m still annoyed, but that’s my right, isn’t it?</P>
<P>I use all things Google, love Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter and the parade of other webapps — certainly, the Cloud is the Future (tm).</P>
<P>I’m also an Exchange/Outlook/IE/Office/Windows/SharePoint/Blackberry user.</P>
<P>So are a lot of enterprise users — for very good reasons.</P>
<P>Oh, and geeks live in this space a-plenty.</P>
<P>Mac/Windows/Linux Fanboy&nbsp;!= Geek Deity</P>
<P>Don’t get me wrong. I’m no MS zealot. I find IE a poor citizen. My brave team of ASP/SharePoint code warriors shudder and rock back-and-forth confused&nbsp;over IE eccentricities. There’s irony in there somewhere.</P>
<P>Yet, I’m a pragmatist. Apparantly so is Marco. We’re just on different sides of the issues at play.</P>
<P>What’s even more ironic is that my IE8 on Windows 7 (7022)&nbsp;renders Instapaper just fine unless I put it in the so-called “compatibility” mode. I just get an annoying message now that is not *quite* accurate.</P>
<P>Perhaps it’s just the tone of the posted message on Instapaper. To me, it implies a value judgement that I wasn’t expecting — that&nbsp;I should go get&nbsp;”real” browser. Perhaps I’m just sensitive and am reading too much in to it.</P>
<P>As an aside, this kind of dialog is exactly what I like about reblogging and where its intended purpose truly shines.</P><P></P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="post">
<P></P><P>No love for Internet Explorer with Instapaper.</P>
<P>I’m pretty annoyed by this on a couple of levels. The following rant is not solely or entirely directed at Marco. I just feel the need to express my thoughts on what I’m seeing as a trend within certain communities.</P>
<P>First, is it really all that hard to code for IE? With <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers">most internet users using some version of IE</A>, this seems technocratic and borders on elitist.</P>
<P>The second level is a building discontent and resentment I’m developing for all things Apple. I liked my Mac. I’d have one again in a minute if it met my needs for staying productive at work.</P>
<P>This just&nbsp;reeks of old Mac fan-boy logic. If it runs on Apple technology, it’s golden. If not, it’s junk. It’s not quite ABM (Anybody But Microsoft), but the net effect is the same.</P>
<P>I agree that IE has some serious shortcomings, but each successive version *does* get better. I work in an enterprise environment that has invested in Microsoft technologies. We use Outlook. We use SharePoint. We use Internet Explorer.</P>
<P>I have every browser under the sun installed and running but I run IE by default. I shouldn’t have to perform application gymnastics to use a website.</P>
<P>The third level builds off the second. Ever since the beloved iPhone/iTouch came out, my Blackberry (also an enterprise decision for my work) has become a developer’s wasteland — a second-class citizen. You can get an iPhone app for everything I can dream up, including Instapaper and Tumblr, but can I get one for my Blackberry? Nope. Nada. Zip.</P>
<P>I play a big role in the enterprise application decision-making.&nbsp;They (the decisions) were&nbsp;(and are) based on facts like total cost of ownership and market/mind share assessments both globally and regionally. User feedback was sought and consensus was remarkably achieved. We had to standardize. The decisions were not hard and remain defensible.</P>
<P>Whether niche players dare to admit or not, Microsoft and its kin are 800 pound gorillas not just because they are big bad bullies. They are wildly popular and the default choice (even if by ignorance) of the majority.</P>
<P>Maybe I should get a Kindle. It seems to be the next golden child of the technorati.</P><BR><FONT size="2"> [ Posted <A href="http://stream.douglangille.ca/post/82658575"> Sun, 01 Mar 2009 20:30:00</A> ]</FONT>

<P></P><P>Weather bombs are the most severe of all winter storms. They are characterized as intense low-pressure systems with a central pressure that falls 24 millibars or more in a 24-hour period.</P>
<P>When a low-pressure system develops over the Atlantic, just off the Carolina coast, it gathers moisture from relatively warm ocean water. If the jet stream is far enough south it brings cold air that combines with the warmer air from the Gulf Stream. A Weather bomb is then created.</P>
<P>Weather bombs are known for dumping heavy amounts of rain and snow, producing hurricane-force winds, and creating high surfs that cause severe beach erosion and coastal flooding.</P>

<H2>Here's the problem and the reason I'm willing to be a little controversial and publicly talk about my skepticism: The politicians sound like apocalyptic preachers who doom us to all kinds of disaster if we don't believe their message. Climate scientists sound like rational adults seeking the truth. Science is all about skepticism. I'm skeptic, and science says I have a real reason to be one.<BR>

<H2>Teaching Human Ethics and Simply Being Thankful<BR>
<FONT size="2"> [ Posted <A href="http://stream.douglangille.ca/post/77080333"> Mon, 09 Feb 2009 23:37:00</A> ]</FONT>
</H2>
<P></P><P>I was talking with a co-worker this morning - that kind of cubicle chatter that usually starts any given day. He was sharing a story about the appropriateness of demonstrating thankfulness and its (possible) religious implications.</P>

<P>At his kid’s daycare, they gather the children together at lunch time, have them sit quietly for about 30 seconds, fold their hands and say “thanks”.</P>

<P>No God was involved - just a moment of pause to be thankful for [the food, the preparers, abundance, and existence in the ‘verse]. Whatever.</P>

<P>My colleague's opinion (one that I share), is that this is pretty safe activity and, if nothing else, helps digestion given the energetic nature of yard-apes.</P>

<P>However, some people get really bent out of shape over this and complain about religious brainwashing and such.</P>

<P>I don’t see any problem with being thankful. Canada is a pretty prosperous and safe country. Our comparative abundance is too often taken for granted.</P>

<P>Anyway, it was a short chat, but it twigged a memory and reminded me of one of my “soapbox injustices”.</P>

<P>As dad was a Nova Scotian teacher in the 70’s, I attended Grades 3-6 (and part of 7) on indian reservations (the Cree First Nation) in northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan (many more tales here that could - and probably will - fill several posts). The reserves had only been under band control for a few years or more. Prior to that, the school system was largely run by the Catholic and Anglican churches and there were a number of leftover in teachers and curriculum (some nuns and Christian Ethics classes).</P>

<P>I attended the Christian Ethics class and later was confirmed in the Anglican Church. I even taught Sunday school at a Presbyterian church during my late teens. I’ve since abandoned Christian dogma (as it no longer makes sense to me) but remain reasonably spiritual despite a nagging inability to rationalize faith. I have always felt that I had a firm moral development and have many influences including family, community, church and school.</P>

<P>Don’t get me wrong. Separating Church and State is a “Good Thing” and I think that teaching any religion in schools and forcing kids to attend church is wrong and pretty close to indoctrination. However, I encourage my kids to read and study faith (we discuss it often) and to choose a belief system that speaks to them (whatever that means). Did we raise them Christian? Sort of (but not really). Are they good people? Yup. I can say that quite confidently at this point. May they never prove me wrong.</P>

<P>My complaint? I think that in the interest of keeping “religion” out of the classroom, we made the mistake of not teaching kids “human ethics”. Kids today seem to lack the respect, courtesy and moral basis that was pounded into our heads thru school and church. Parental rights seem to have been diluted as is their ability to influence - all in the interest of political correctness.</P>

<P>I just said “kids today”. Maybe I’m just getting old.</P>

<P>Anyway, I think I’ll take the time to be thankful more often. I’m glad to see a daycare at least try to teach the “missing lesson”. It’s a good example of how to be a better citizen of the wider human community.</P><P></P>

<H2>The problem is that Hawley is not doing anything to prevent future attacks. Only past threats (and not even realistic ones at that). Once again, let us break down the threat scenarios a bit.<BR><BR>#1. Terrorists hijack a plane. Simple to solve. Keep the OLD security systems in place to find guns and bombs. Add to that reinforced doors to the flight decks to keep the terrorists away from the pilots until the plane can be landed. For a bit more protection, have security personnel on the flights armed with tonfas. There, problem pretty much solved. <BR><BR>#2. Terrorists blow up a plane in flight using a bomb of some kind. Difficult to solve. Focus on improving the detection systems. And just learn to live with the idea that there is no perfect safety. Flying is still safer than being in a car on the highway. <BR><BR>And in both scenarios, you get to keep your nail clippers.<BR>

<P>Look at all of the crap Bush left open. (via <A href="http://tumblelog.marco.org/71879908">marco</A>)</P><P></P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="post">
<H2>My fellow citizens:<BR><BR>
I stand here today humbled by the task before us, grateful for the trust you have bestowed, mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors. I thank President Bush for his service to our nation, as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.<BR><BR>
Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential oath. The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace. Yet, every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms. At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebears, and true to our founding documents.<BR><BR>
So it has been. So it must be with this generation of Americans.<BR><BR>
That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood. Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred. Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age. Homes have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered. Our health care is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.<BR><BR>
These are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics. Less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land â€” a nagging fear that America’s decline is inevitable, and that the next generation must lower its sights.<BR><BR>
Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They are serious and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America â€” they will be met.
On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord.<BR><BR>
On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled our politics.<BR><BR>
We remain a young nation, but in the words of scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things. The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history; to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation to generation: the God-given promise that all are equal, all are free and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness.<BR><BR>
In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given. It must be earned. Our journey has never been one of shortcuts or settling for less. It has not been the path for the faint-hearted â€” for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things â€” some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom.<BR><BR>
For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life.<BR><BR>
For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth.<BR><BR>
For us, they fought and died, in places like Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sahn.
Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.<BR><BR>
This is the journey we continue today. We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth. Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began. Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year. Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions â€” that time has surely passed. Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America.<BR><BR>
For everywhere we look, there is work to be done. The state of the economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we will act â€” not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation for growth. We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together. We will restore science to its rightful place, and wield technology’s wonders to raise health care’s quality and lower its cost. We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories. And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age. All this we can do. And all this we will do.
Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions â€” who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans. Their memories are short. For they have forgotten what this country has already done; what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, and necessity to courage.<BR><BR>
What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them â€” that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply. The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works â€” whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified. Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is no, programs will end. And those of us who manage the public’s dollars will be held to account â€” to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day â€” because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government.<BR><BR>
Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control â€” and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous. The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our gross domestic product, but on the reach of our prosperity; on our ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart â€” not out of charity, but because it is the surest route to our common good.
As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals. Our founding fathers, faced with perils we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations. Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience’s sake. And so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and that we are ready to lead once more.<BR><BR>
Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks, but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions. They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please. Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.<BR><BR>
We are the keepers of this legacy. Guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort â€” even greater cooperation and understanding between nations. We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan. With old friends and former foes, we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a warming planet. We will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you.<BR><BR>
For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus â€” and non-believers. We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth; and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace.<BR><BR>
To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect. To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society’s ills on the West â€” know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy. To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history; but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.<BR><BR>
To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds. And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our borders; nor can we consume the world’s resources without regard to effect. For the world has changed, and we must change with it.<BR><BR>
As we consider the road that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave Americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains. They have something to tell us today, just as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages. We honor them not only because they are guardians of our liberty, but because they embody the spirit of service; a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves. And yet, at this moment â€” a moment that will define a generation â€” it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all.<BR><BR>
For as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the American people upon which this nation relies. It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break, the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours. It is the firefighter’s courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent’s willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate.
Our challenges may be new. The instruments with which we meet them may be new. But those values upon which our success depends â€” hard work and honesty, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism â€” these things are old. These things are true. They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history. What is demanded then is a return to these truths. What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility â€” a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task.<BR><BR>
This is the price and the promise of citizenship.<BR><BR>
This is the source of our confidence â€” the knowledge that God calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny.<BR><BR>
This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed â€” why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall, and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath.<BR><BR>
So let us mark this day with remembrance, of who we are and how far we have traveled. In the year of America’s birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river. The capital was abandoned. The enemy was advancing. The snow was stained with blood. At a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt, the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people:<BR><BR>
“Let it be told to the future world … that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive…that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet (it).”<BR><BR>
America, in the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words. With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come. Let it be said by our children’s children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God’s grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations.<BR>

<H2>Remember, if it’s in the news don’t worry about it. The very definition of news is “something that almost never happens.” When something is so common that it’s no longer newsâ€”car crashes, domestic violenceâ€”that’s when you should worry about it.<BR>

<H2>Part of the debtor mentality is a constant, frantically suppressed undercurrent of terror. We have one of the highest debt-to-income ratios in the world, and apparently most of us are two paychecks from the street. Those in power — governments, employers — exploit this, to great effect. Frightened people are obedient — not just physically, but intellectually and emotionally. If your employer tells you to work overtime, and you know that refusing could jeopardize everything you have, then not only do you work the overtime, but you convince yourself that you’re doing it voluntarily, out of loyalty to the company; because the alternative is to acknowledge that you are living in terror. Before you know it, you’ve persuaded yourself that you have a profound emotional attachment to some vast multinational corporation: you’ve indentured not just your working hours, but your entire thought process. The only people who are capable of either unfettered action or unfettered thought are those who — either because they’re heroically brave, or because they’re insane, or because they know themselves to be safe — are free from fear.<BR>

<H2>WeightWatchers, Measurement, and Motivation<BR>

<P></P><P>One of <A href="http://douglangille.tumblr.com/post/20343384/doug-langilles-top-five-clifton-strengthsfinder-themes">my top strengths</A>&nbsp;is Connectedness (others include Analytical, Strategic, Input and Learner).</P>
<P>So, it’s not usually a surprise when I connect the dots between completely unrelated ideas.</P>
<P>I joined WeightWatchers in late-November and have had some&nbsp;reasonable&nbsp;success so far — all is good. I have a good support system and team-mates in our journey. The meeting leader at WW is very good and takes the role of facilitator quite expertly.</P>
<P>The conversation last evening hit home on a couple of points that I have been focusing on in my work-life.</P>
<P>One was on measurement and reporting — in the program, a keystone set of habits involve the conscious measurement and&nbsp;journalling&nbsp;of nutritional information and portion sizes of whatever one stuffs in their maw.</P>
<P>It’s metrics-based management logic:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You can’t manage what you can’t measure.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>But it’s <A href="http://douglangille.tumblr.com/post/38071136/why-measure">Nathan Womack’s chant on the purpose of measurement</A>, that really hits home.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Measurement leads to Reporting
<BR>
Reporting leads to Visibility
<BR>
Visibility leads to Focus
<BR>
Focus leads to Change
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The other topc was on “committment” versus “interest”. I was immediately reminded of the <A href="http://douglangille.tumblr.com/post/39773441/a-pig-and-a-chicken-are-walking-down-a-road-the">Chickens and Pigs parable </A>that is often used to describe Scrum Agile Development Project Methodology.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A pig and a chicken are walking down a road. The chicken looks at the pig and says, ...Hey, why don't we open a restaurant?“ The pig looks back at the chicken and says, ...Good idea, what do you want to call it?“ The chicken thinks about it and says, ...Why don't we call it 'Ham and Eggs'?“ ...I don't think so,“ says the pig, ...I'd be committed but you'd only be involved.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It’s funny and makes a good point — a better one for WW than for Agile, methinks.</P>

<P></P><P>New Year’s Nor’easter - I hope we don’t lose power. It’d be out for a while. Planning on cooking a turkey tomorrow. Might be a BBQ.</P>
<P><A href="http://weatheroffice.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?ns1">Weather Warnings - Environment Canada</A></P>
<P>A deepening low pressure system south Yarmouth this evening will continue to intensify as it tracks northeastward. The low will continue to intensify as it tracks parallel to the Nova Scotia coast overnight and will lie near Sable Island Thursday morning. The low will move east of Cape Breton later Thursday afternoon as a very intense winter storm.<BR><BR>Snow from this system has already moved into western and central Nova Scotia. It will spread northeastward to the remainder of the province tonight. Snow will become heavy at times tonight..And this combined with strengthening northeast winds will give occasional near zero visibilities in snow and blowing snow. Snow will ease off over western Nova Scotia Thursday morning but will persist over the eastern mainland and Cape Breton until late in the day. Total snowfall amounts of 25 centimetres are likely over western sections of the province…While the rest of the mainland could receive 25 to 40 centimetres with locally higher amounts possible especially over eastern areas. Cape Breton will likely see between 30 and 50 centimetres with locally 60 centimetres possible in some areas before snow tapers to flurries Thursday evening.<BR><BR>Strong northeasterly winds will develop as the low approaches tonight then shift to very strong northerly winds Thursday morning as the low passes southeast of the province. Mainland Nova Scotia will likely see wind gusts of 80 to 100&nbsp;km/h with locally higher gusts possible over some exposed locations. Cape Breton will see wind gusts to 100&nbsp;km/h with some exposed areas possibly gusting to near 120&nbsp;km/h on Thursday. These very strong winds will give widespread blowing snow and white out conditions…As well as cold wind chill values…To much of Nova Scotia on Thursday. Winds will ease somewhat over southwestern Nova Scotia Thursday afternoon but strong winds and blizzard conditions will persist over eastern sections until late Thursday evening or Friday morning.<BR><BR>In addition..Higher than normal waters levels can be expected Thursday afternoon and evening for the Northumberland coast of mainland Nova Scotia and the northwest and northeast coasts of Cape Breton. Between Cape George and cape north..Including st. Georges bay..These high water levels combined with heavy pounding surf could give local coastal flooding during high tide later on Thursday and Thursday night.</P><P></P>

<P>This is a pretty good “state of the union” on the air of discontent among productivity mavens. It’s most likely a convergence of philosophies that’s at play. Look for big mindset changes to continue for next year.</P>
<P>Personally, I like the move away from the ethos of corporate productivity and would welcome approaches that tie-in the best of strengths-based positive psychology and life-long learning.</P>

<H2>I don’t think there’s some magic trick here. I think I’ve got a good nose for talent, so I hire really good people. And I’ve got a pretty healthy ego, so I’m not scared of hiring the smartest people, even when they’re smarter than me. And I have a low tolerance of nonsense and turf battles and game-playing, and I send that message very clearly. And so over time, I think, people start trusting each other, and they stay focused on mission, as opposed to personal ambition or grievance. If you’ve got really smart people who are all focused on the same mission, then usually you can get some things done.<BR>

I linked it (with surprising diffculty) to my Facebook status and my Windows Live Messenger “personal message”. Ta-da! Everyone could answer the question: “what is Doug up to?” I even set it up to work from my Blackberry. Now what?<BR><BR>Nothing. Nada. Zip. A complete and utter waste of time for me. In fact, I want that time back. No one I know uses Twitter and most use Facebook already.

<P></P><P>Mostly chest-thumping rhetoric. Both traded in fear-mongering. Too bad. I would have liked to hear something more substancial.</P>
<P>Dion doesn’t have nearly the same polish as Harper and I think it hurts him immensely as a leader.</P>
<P>I hope a confidence motion is allowed to proceed on Monday - that’s how the system works. While the motivations behind the Coalition is suspicious, I think that it’s likely the best chance for addressing the issues. The “trickle-down” economics approach of the Tories have proven to not work - we need more direct action to the fundamentals of Main Street.</P>
<P>Suspending parliament is pretty slippery and obvious in its intent - it should not be allowed to happen. I don’t relish the thought of another election (time and money). The lesser evil is to let the rules play out and give the Coalition an opportunity to lead - as is their right.</P>
<P>The G-G has some tough decisions to make.</P><P></P>

<P>The Conservative government introduced an economic and fiscal statement last week that failed to provide economic relief for Canadians or any measures to get the economy back on track.</P>
<P>The Harper government is also committed to trampling workers’ rights and women’s rights to pay equity.</P>
<P>Canadians need a government that shows leadership.</P>
<P>The opposition parties are acting in a responsible manner. They are not going to force another costly and time-consuming election. Instead the Liberals and the NDP are planning to form a coalition government, with the support of the Bloc QuÃ©becois in the House of Commons, to get this Parliament to address the economic crisis in a way that benefits workers and their families.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Canadian politics are never this interesting.&nbsp; Never.&nbsp; It's all very confusing and awesome.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I am mixed on this one.</P>
<P>75% of people didn’t want Liberals or Dion. 65% didn’t want Harper’s Conservative - yet they won! I voted for Jack Layton’s New Democrats. Go figure.</P>
<P>Actually, I voted for my local NDP MP, Peter Stoffer (who won his seat).</P>
<P>Most people these days vote for party leaders and not party platforms per se, but on the merits of the leadership. Sadly, MPs and MLAs are often more concerned with partisanship than with constituency.</P>
<P>Two things to remember about Canadian politics:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Prime Ministers are not Presidents - too much “americana” in Canadian political mindshare these days.</LI>
<LI>All politics (federal, provincial and municipal) is local - it is the MP, MLA and Councilor that really affect lives (or at least they should be).</LI>
</OL>
<P>I’m OK with a little shakeup - as long as it’s brief and decisive so that Ottawa can get back to working on solving real problems.</P>
<P>Winter is upon us and people are losing their jobs. What’s really important here?</P>

<H2>What if a demon were to creep after you one night, in your loneliest loneliness, and say, 'This life which you live must be lived by you once again and innumerable times more; and every pain and joy and thought and sigh must come again to you, all in the same sequence. The eternal hourglass will again and again be turned and you with it, dust of the dust!' Would you throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse that demon? Or would you answer, 'Never have I heard anything more divine'?<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A href="http://www.pantheon.org/articles/p/pandora.html">The story of Pandora</A> is well-known and pretty simple:&nbsp;&nbsp;Pandora was presented with a box (or jar) and asked not to open it under any circumstances. &nbsp;She opened it, and out sprung every conceivable (and inconceivable) pestilence â€” a profusion of horror for all mankind, if you will.</P>
<P>But there was something left at the bottom of the box: &nbsp;Hope. &nbsp;Apparently,&nbsp;Hope remained to compensate for all of the other malefactions. &nbsp;<B>But why is Hope such a good thing? &nbsp; Perhaps it is but the final human pestilence.</B></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>As virtues go, hope is a curious one. It leads to a lot of disappointment. Undertaking a project that is likely to succeed is a rational, prudent thing. That's not acting out of hope. Hope is the thing that keeps keeps us going even when reason tells us to give up. Hope is what tells us to try again, even when we're certain it isn't worth the effort. Hope is what tells us that even when everything we're striving for seems pointless, perhaps there is, somewhere, a message worth hearing. And when life seems like nothing more than a bothesome way to die, hope whispers that there is more on heaven and earth than we've dreamed of in our philosophy.</P>
<P><A href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeSYvBc6WvI">Hope</A> is more than anticipation. Hope calls us to dash ourselves against the impossibleâ€”or what we think is the impossibleâ€”because something deep within us does not trust our own assessments. Hope is the coal that can blossom into flame. Hope is human and divine, and to lose it is to lose both.</P>
<P>Without hope, and without those other irrational virtues, faith and love, what can be good? Without hope, what can turn aside despair?</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>There are many analogues to this kind of dichotomy. Without “evil” how would we recognize “goodness”? Can “hope” even exist without “despair”?</P>
<P>Comic books (and greek mythology) explore this stuff quite often.</P>
<P>Of course, now,&nbsp;I have to go watch Unbreakable and Dark Knight again.</P><P></P>

<P>Tumblr assigns a sequential number to each site on their service.&nbsp; The lower the number, the older the site.&nbsp; To find your number, login to Tumblr, go to the <A href="http://www.tumblr.com/following">Following Page</A>, then click on the name of your site in the top right corner of the screen just below the ...log out“ link.&nbsp; Now, look at the URL in your browser address bar and note the number at the end of the URL.&nbsp; Mine looks like this:</P>
<P><A href="http://www.tumblr.com/tumblelog/"></A><A href="http://www.tumblr.com/tumblelog/">http://www.tumblr.com/tumblelog/</A><B>18189</B></P>
<P>That means <A href="http://joelaz.com/">JoeLaz.com</A> was the 18,189th site created on Tumblr.&nbsp; A total of 442,648 sites have been created to date.</P>
<P>So, what's your Tumblr number?</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I'm number 11,613. I guess that makes me an old-timer.<BR>Well, that and the fact that I'm old.</P>

<P>Dear American:
</P>
I need to ask you to support an urgent secret business relationship with a
transfer of funds of great magnitude.<P>
I am Ministry of the Treasury of the Republic of America. My country has had
crisis that has caused the need for large transfer of funds of 800 billion
dollars US. If you would assist me in this transfer, it would be most
profitable to you.</P>
<P>
I am working with Mr. Phil Gram, lobbyist for UBS, who will be my
replacement as Ministry of the Treasury in January. As a Senator, you may
know him as the leader of the American banking deregulation movement in the
1990s. This transactin is 100% safe.</P>
<P>
This is a matter of great urgency. We need a blank check. We need the funds
as quickly as possible. We cannot directly transfer these funds in the names
of our close friends because we are constantly under surveillance. My family
lawyer advised me that I should look for a reliable and trustworthy person
who will act as a next of kin so the funds can be transferred.</P>
<P>
Please reply with all of your bank account, IRA and college fund account
numbers and those of your children and grandchildren to
wallstreetbailout@treasury.gov so that we may transfer your commission for
this transaction. After I receive that information, I will respond with
detailed information about safeguards that will be used to protect the
funds.</P>
<P>Yours Faithfully Minister of Treasury Paulson</P><P></P>

<P>A professor once visited a Japanese master to inquire about Zen. The master served tea. When the visitor's cup was full, the master kept pouring. Tea spilled out of the cup and over the table.</P>
<P>...The cup is full!“ said the professor. ...No more will go in!“</P>
<P>...Like this cup,“ said the master, ...You are full of your own opinions and speculations. How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup?“</P>
