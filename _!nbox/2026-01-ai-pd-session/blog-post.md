# Three AI Tricks I'm Using (That You Probably Should Too)

*Digital Doug, January 2026*

---

There's a Copilot button in practically every corner of O365 now. I know you've seen it. I also know a lot of you are wondering "okay... but what do I actually *do* with this?"

Here are three things I'm actually using, not just talking about. Turns out, it's not the fancy stuff. It's the boring, everyday tasks that AI handles surprisingly well. I'm using Microsoft Copilot mostly, but these techniques work just as well with Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, or whatever tool you've got access to.

## 1. Making Your Emails Actually Readable

This one's huge, and honestly? It's humbling every single time I do it.

We write for ourselves, not our audience. Whether you're sending emails to students with varying literacy levels, folks who use English as an additional language, or just busy people who don't have time to decode paragraph three to find the deadline - we could all be clearer.

Try this: Draft your email, then ask "rewrite this for grade 8 reading level while keeping all important information and deadlines. Make it clear and friendly."

The result? Shorter subject lines. Bullet points instead of paragraphs. "Please make sure to" instead of "This correspondence is to inform you that." Same information, half the words, twice as clear.

**Important:** Don't paste anything confidential or personally identifiable into web-grounded tools. Draft a generic version, get it cleaned up, then customize with specific names or details afterward.

## 2. Organizing Your Messy Thinking (AKA Reverse Prompting)

This one's different, and it's the one that surprises people most. Most folks think AI is about asking a question and getting an answer. But you can also dump your scattered brain onto the screen and let AI help you *think*.

**If you're planning something:** You have an hour of professional development time this afternoon. Your thoughts are scattered - something about AI tools, accessibility requirements changed, new metrics to report, rubric design came up last week, equity training is mandatory, time management keeps showing up in complaints. What do you actually cover?

Prompt: "I have an hour with my team this afternoon to cover professional development. Here's what I'm thinking: [paste your messy list]. Help me organize this into a coherent session plan."

What AI does: Groups related items. Identifies themes. Suggests priorities. Time-blocks it realistically. Tells you what won't fit in an hour.

**If you're a student:** Your group project is a mess - three people with different ideas, a presentation due Friday, and nobody knows who's doing what. 

Prompt: "Group project on sustainable energy. Sarah wants to focus on solar, Mike says wind power, I'm thinking hydro. We need a 15-minute presentation, research paper, and demo. Due Friday. Help organize this into tasks."

Result: AI organizes tasks by deliverable, assigns realistic timelines, suggests who handles what based on the interests you mentioned. You still negotiate with your group, but now you've got a starting point instead of chaos.

Then you can follow up: "Ask me smart one-at-a-time questions to help clarify what should be the focus."

And it actually asks you clarifying questions - "What's the most urgent concern?" "Are any of these required vs. optional?" You answer based on your context, and it refines the output.

**This works for:** Planning meetings or study sessions, organizing meeting notes, thinking through project priorities, structuring presentations, clarifying any fuzzy problem where you know the pieces but not the structure.

**Privacy note:** Keep it generic when brainstorming. No student names, no specific complaints, no confidential issues. Describe the *problem* generically, not the specific people or details.

## 3. Finding Current Information (Without Falling Into a Rabbit Hole)

You know how you mean to stay current with what's happening in your field, but who has time to read trade publications every day? Web-grounded AI pulls recent articles and research for you.

Example prompt: "Find recent articles about [your specific topic] in [your specific context]"

Notice the specificity - *community colleges* not just "higher education," *administrative challenges* not just "leadership." The more specific you are, the less sorting you do afterward.

What you get: Recent articles (often from the past few months), themes that actually match your day-to-day reality, and you can ask it to "create a summary report" as a follow-up if you want the highlights organized.

Is this going to replace actually reading? No. But it'll get you 80% of the way there when you need to know "what's current on this topic" without spending an hour scrolling.

## Bonus: Excel Help (When You're Not an Excel Wizard)

Systems export massive Excel files. I've watched people spend hours trying to make sense of them.

**With web-grounded Copilot:** Ask it to help you understand Excel functions, create formulas, or explain pivot table strategies. "How do I create a pivot table that groups data by category and month?" or "What's the formula to calculate an average excluding blank cells?"

**With full LLMs (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.):** You can paste sample data (sanitized of personal info) and get more specific help. "Here's a sample of my data structure - help me spot patterns" or "write me the formula to do [specific calculation]."

Is it faster than just learning Excel properly? Maybe not long-term. But when you need an answer *today* and you're not an Excel wizard, it works.

## The Real Talk

None of this makes you an AI expert. It just makes you someone who's putting in the time to figure out what actually works. The table stakes right now aren't about building custom GPTs or understanding transformer models - they're about writing clearer messages, organizing your thinking, staying current with information, and asking better questions.

**Know your tools:** Web-grounded Copilot is great for general questions, research, and non-confidential work. For sensitive data or internal documents, you need a licensed tool with proper data handling - or you need to be very careful about what you share.

Pick one of these three things (or the Excel bonus if that's your jam). Try it this week. See if it saves you 15 minutes. That's it.

I'm just five minutes ahead of you on this stuff, and I'm still figuring it out. But those five minutes have saved me hours.

**Your turn:** Which one are you trying first?

## NOTES FOR NEXT REVISION

**Doug's feedback (Jan 6, 4:08 PM):**
- Need more "me" in the post - missing sense of story/narrative
- Need to inject personal narrative and lived experience
- Probably want more snark

**Current state:**
- Evergreen version (no PD session references)
- De-jargonized (removed NSCC-specific acronyms)
- Restructured: Email → Reverse Prompting → Research
- Added student example (group project chaos)
- Reader panel validated: tone good, examples practical, needs personal voice

**To explore:**
- Where does Doug's story fit? Opening? Throughout examples?
- What lived experiences anchor each section?
- How to add snark without losing peer-beside-you vibe?
- Specific moments/anecdotes that show "five minutes ahead" in practice?
