# Four AI Tricks I'm Using (That You Probably Should Too)

*Draft for Digital Doug - January 2026*

So here's the thing - there's a Copilot button in practically every corner of O365 now. I know you've seen it. I also know a lot of you are wondering "okay... but what do I actually *do* with this?"

I got asked this exact question yesterday about a session I'm running tomorrow, and honestly? I had the same panic moment you might be having. "Wait, what have I learned over the past year that's actually useful?" Turns out, it's not the fancy stuff. It's the boring, everyday administrative tasks that AI handles surprisingly well.

Here are four things I'm actually using, not just talking about. I'm using Microsoft Copilot mostly, but these techniques work just as well with Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, or whatever tool you've got access to.

## 1. Summarizing Meeting Notes (So You Can Actually Use Them)

You know how you come out of those all-schools meetings with pages of notes that you *mean* to review but never quite get around to? I've started feeding those into AI and asking it to pull out action items or themes relevant to my role.

Example prompt: "Here are my notes from the academic planning meeting. Pull out anything that affects administrative tasks or requires follow-up from academic chairs."

**The catch with web-grounded Copilot:** You can't just paste your internal meeting notes directly - it needs web-accessible content to work with. But you *can* use this technique with publicly available resources: conference session notes, webinar summaries, or industry reports. For internal notes, you'll need an LLM that accepts direct text input (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity).

It's not magic, but it saves me from re-reading everything three times trying to remember what I'm supposed to do.

## 2. Making Your Emails Actually Readable

This one's huge, and it works great with web-grounded Copilot. We write for ourselves, not our audience. Academic chairs are sending emails to students with varying literacy levels, including folks who use English as an additional language.

Try this: Draft your email in a public-facing tool (like the stand-alone Copilot chat), then ask "rewrite this for grade 8 reading level while keeping the key information." Compare the two. It's humbling how much clearer the simpler version is.

**Important:** Don't paste anything confidential or personally identifiable into web-grounded tools. Draft a generic version, get it cleaned up, then customize with your specific details afterward.

## 3. Turning Excel Dumps Into Actual Information

PeopleSoft queries give us these massive Excel files. I've watched people spend hours trying to make sense of them.

**With web-grounded Copilot:** You can ask it to help you understand Excel functions, create formulas, or explain pivot table strategies. "How do I create a pivot table that groups enrollment data by program and term?" or "What's the formula to calculate average GPA excluding blank cells?"

**With full LLMs (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.):** You can paste sample data (sanitized of personal info) and get more specific help. "Here's a sample of my data structure - help me spot patterns" or "write me the formula to do [specific calculation]."

Is it faster than just learning Excel properly? Maybe not long-term. But when you need an answer *today* and you're not an Excel wizard, it works.

## 4. Brainstorming That Actually Goes Somewhere

"Effective brainstorming" sounds fancy, but really it's just about writing prompts that don't give you garbage back. This works brilliantly with web-grounded Copilot because it's pulling from current web resources.

Instead of "give me ideas for professional development," try "I have 30 minutes with academic chairs who are overwhelmed with admin tasks. What are three focused topics I could cover that they could implement this week? Look for current best practices in higher education."

The more specific you are, the less time you waste sorting through useless suggestions. Web-grounded tools will actually pull from recent articles and resources, which can be more current than what traditional LLMs have in their training data.

## The Real Talk

None of this makes you an AI expert. It just makes you someone who's putting in the time to figure out what actually works. The table stakes right now aren't about building custom GPTs or understanding transformer models - they're about basic prompting, summarizing notes, processing dense materials, and asking better questions.

**Know your tools:** Web-grounded Copilot (what most of us at NSCC have access to) is great for general questions, research, and non-confidential work. For sensitive data or internal documents, you need a licensed tool with proper data handling - or you need to be very careful about what you share.

Pick one of these four things. Try it this week. See if it saves you 15 minutes. That's it.

I'm just five minutes ahead of you on this stuff, and I'm still figuring it out. But those five minutes have saved me hours.

**Your turn:** Which one are you trying first?
