# Three AI Tricks I'm Using (That You Probably Should Too)

*Digital Doug, January 2026*

---

I'm a nerd. That's the tweet.

When I see a new tool, I get the big dopamine splash and I go all-in. Before AI, it was graphic design, then productivity frameworks, then coaching models. I can't help myself. But this time something different happened: the tool actually stuck.

I've always hated staring at a blank page. I procrastinate, I put things off, I tell myself I work better under pressure - which is bullshit because literally no one works better under pressure. But AI gave me a way to just start. Brain dump the chaos, let the tool organize it, then build with intention.

My wife was recently diagnosed with ADHD. She showed me Goblin Tools - this simple brain-dump-to-to-do-list thing. I tried it. It worked. Then I thought: if it works for task lists, maybe it works for everything else.

So I dumped a 10-year-old short story into ChatGPT and asked for a literary critique. "Mitzy and the Butterfly" - this fever dream fantasy about sibling rivalry where a girl navigates a maze to rescue her sister with advice from a sarcastic butterfly named Larry. I'd always thought there was more to it, but I was stuck.

The AI came back with ideas. Good ones. I didn't let it write the additions - finished prose is mine - but that back-and-forth conversation unlocked something. Now it's expanding into a much longer work.

That's when I realized: writing isn't the point. Organizing my thinking is. Getting the shit out of my brain into structure I can actually use.

Here are three things I'm actually doing with AI now - not just talking about. Turns out, it's not the fancy stuff. It's boring everyday tasks. I've paid for ChatGPT Plus (six months, too expensive in Canadian dollars, unsubscribed). Tried Gemini (great for analysis), Claude (best for brainstorming), Mistral (uncensored, useful for dark fantasy writing). In December I got a free year of Perplexity Pro, which routes between models automatically and connects to my GitHub repository where I keep a decade of markdown notes. That GitHub connection? Game-changer for retrieval.

For work, I use Copilot exclusively. College-approved tool, proper data handling. For blogging, creative writing, personal stuff - I use everything else. Privacy and intellectual property matter. Keep them separate.

## 1. Making Your Emails Actually Readable

This one's huge, and honestly? It's humbling every single time I do it.

We write for ourselves, not our audience. Whether you're sending emails to students with varying literacy levels, folks who use English as an additional language, or just busy people who don't have time to decode paragraph three to find the deadline - we could all be clearer.

Try this: Draft your email, then ask "rewrite this for grade 8 reading level while keeping all important information and deadlines. Make it clear and friendly."

I have a bad habit: I use $10 words when $0.10 words would do. I like how language sounds as much as what it means. It's persuasive affect, but it gets lost.

I already knew about bottom-line-up-front, inverted pyramid structure for long emails, all that stuff. But I still couldn't write simply. So I ran my emails through ChatGPT. It was scathing. "Bring this down to accessible reading level." 

I'd used Hemingway app before - paste your text, clean up complicated sentences, fix heavy jargon. But it was always an extra step, an extra tool, an external webpage. I'd skip it. Using Copilot puts that clarity check right in the application. That removed the friction. Now I actually do it.

The result? Shorter subject lines. Bullet points instead of paragraphs. "Please make sure to" instead of "This correspondence is to inform you that." Same information, half the words, twice as clear.

**There's nothing worse than putting stuff out there and not knowing what you wrote. I might as well be drunk.**

**Important:** Don't paste anything confidential or personally identifiable into web-grounded tools. Draft a generic version, get it cleaned up, then customize with specific names or details afterward.

## 2. Organizing Your Messy Thinking (AKA Reverse Prompting)

This one's different, and it's the one that surprises people most. Most folks think AI is about asking a question and getting an answer. But you can also dump your scattered brain onto the screen and let AI help you *think*.

**If you're planning something:** You have an hour of professional development time this afternoon. Your thoughts are scattered - something about AI tools, accessibility requirements changed, new metrics to report, rubric design came up last week, equity training is mandatory, time management keeps showing up in complaints. What do you actually cover?

Prompt: "I have an hour with my team this afternoon to cover professional development. Here's what I'm thinking: [paste your messy list]. Help me organize this into a coherent session plan."

What AI does: Groups related items. Identifies themes. Suggests priorities. Time-blocks it realistically. Tells you what won't fit in an hour.

**If you're a student:** Your group project is a mess - three people with different ideas, a presentation due Friday, and nobody knows who's doing what. 

Prompt: "Group project on sustainable energy. Sarah wants to focus on solar, Mike says wind power, I'm thinking hydro. We need a 15-minute presentation, research paper, and demo. Due Friday. Help organize this into tasks."

Result: AI organizes tasks by deliverable, assigns realistic timelines, suggests who handles what based on the interests you mentioned. You still negotiate with your group, but now you've got a starting point instead of chaos.

Then you can follow up: "Ask me smart one-at-a-time questions to help clarify what should be the focus."

And it actually asks you clarifying questions - "What's the most urgent concern?" "Are any of these required vs. optional?" You answer based on your context, and it refines the output.

### The Long Chat Mistake

It took me way too long to figure this out: I used to try having one giant endless chat dedicated to a topic. Story development in one thread, tool management in another, everything piling up for weeks.

Bad idea. The context window drifts. The AI starts forgetting what happened earlier. I'd spend half my time re-reminding it what we'd already covered, what it was supposed to remember, stay on track.

Eventually I learned: clear instructions, clear intention, fresh context. Don't treat it like Google with keyword searches. Give it the goal - what you want and why it matters - then let it figure out the how.

**This works for:** Planning meetings or study sessions, organizing meeting notes, thinking through project priorities, structuring presentations, clarifying any fuzzy problem where you know the pieces but not the structure.

**Privacy note:** Keep it generic when brainstorming. No student names, no specific complaints, no confidential issues. Describe the *problem* generically, not the specific people or details.

**It's never about putting information in. It's always about getting information out.**

## 3. Finding Current Information (Without Falling Into a Rabbit Hole)

You know how you mean to stay current with what's happening in your field, but who has time to read trade publications every day? Web-grounded AI pulls recent articles and research for you.

Example prompt: "Find recent articles about [your specific topic] in [your specific context]"

Notice the specificity - *community colleges* not just "higher education," *administrative challenges* not just "leadership." The more specific you are, the less sorting you do afterward.

What you get: Recent articles (often from the past few months), themes that actually match your day-to-day reality, and you can ask it to "create a summary report" as a follow-up if you want the highlights organized.

Is this going to replace actually reading? No. But it'll get you 80% of the way there when you need to know "what's current on this topic" without spending an hour scrolling.

## When AI Actually Saved My Bacon

I'm a procrastinator. I put presentations off until the day before. Like tomorrow's session - I'm prepping it tonight.

I like to tell myself I work better under pressure. It's a lie. No one works better under pressure. What actually happens: I either over-prepare and psych myself out, or I wing it and deliver something serviceable but not great. Lots of "ums" and "ahs." Absent-minded professor vibes. Not great.

AI didn't speed up my process. If anything, it slowed me down. But it forced me to think with intention. The back-and-forth iteration, the testing, the refinement - I actually do the planning now because the tool makes it conversational.

If I didn't use AI for that process, I wouldn't do it at all. I'd wing it. And it would show.

So yeah, AI saved me. Not by doing the work, but by making me do the work I should've been doing all along.

## Bonus: Excel Help (When You're Not an Excel Wizard)

Systems export massive Excel files. I've watched people spend hours trying to make sense of them.

**With web-grounded Copilot:** Ask it to help you understand Excel functions, create formulas, or explain pivot table strategies. "How do I create a pivot table that groups data by category and month?" or "What's the formula to calculate an average excluding blank cells?"

**With full LLMs (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.):** You can paste sample data (sanitized of personal info) and get more specific help. "Here's a sample of my data structure - help me spot patterns" or "write me the formula to do [specific calculation]."

Is it faster than just learning Excel properly? Maybe not long-term. But when you need an answer *today* and you're not an Excel wizard, it works.

## The Real Talk

I've tried seven AI tools this year. Six are gone. ChatGPT Plus? Too expensive. Mistral? Too niche. NotebookLM? Solved problems I don't have. The graveyard is how you figure out what works.

What stuck: Tools that removed friction. Tools that let me start before I'm ready. Tools that make me think with intention instead of winging it.

None of this makes you an AI expert. The table stakes right now aren't about building custom GPTs or understanding transformer models. They're about writing clearer messages, organizing scattered thinking, and asking better questions.

**Know your tools:** Web-grounded Copilot is fine for general questions, research, non-confidential work. For sensitive data or internal documents, you need a licensed tool with proper data handling - or you need to be very careful what you share.

Pick one of these three things. Try it this week. See if it saves you 15 minutes.

I'm just five minutes ahead of you on this stuff, and I'm still figuring it out. The tools will keep changing. But those five minutes have saved me hours.
