# PD Session Outline: Practical AI for Academic Chairs
**30 Minutes | NSCC CTL/AC Meeting | January 8, 2026**

## Tool: Microsoft Copilot Chat for Enterprise (Education)
**Important: Web-grounded only - no licensed add-ons**

---

## REVISED SESSION PLAN

**Change from original:** Replaced Excel demo with Reverse Prompting/Brainstorming demo
- **Why:** Matt said "Excel might be too much to cram into 30 minutes"
- **Better alignment:** You said "reverse prompting" in your original response to Matt
- **Higher value:** Shows conversational AI vs. just getting answers
- **More broadly applicable:** Works for ANY fuzzy thinking problem

---

## Pre-Session Prep

- [ ] Browser open to Copilot Chat (copilot.microsoft.com) - demo account
- [ ] Have prompts ready in OneNote/Word doc for copy/paste
- [ ] **Critical reminder:** No confidential data, no student info, no internal docs
- [ ] Test reverse prompting flow one more time
- [ ] Have brain dump example ready (PD planning scenario)

---

## Session Flow

### Minutes 0-5: The Setup

**Opening questions:**
- "Show of hands - who's seen the Copilot button in O365? Who's actually used it?"

**Set expectations:**
- "Quick important note: we're using the web-grounded version of Copilot today. That means it searches the internet to help you, but it also means we can't paste confidential information into it."
- "I'm not an AI expert. I'm just someone who's been experimenting for the past year. Today I want to show you THREE things that actually save me time."
- "Not the fancy stuff everyone talks about - the table stakes that help with administrative work."

**The three things:**
1. Finding current research and best practices
2. Making your writing clearer
3. Organizing messy thinking and brain dumps

---

### Minutes 5-10: Demo 1 - Research & Current Best Practices

**The setup:**
"Let's start by asking Copilot what's current in higher education about YOUR challenges."

**Prompt (emphasize specificity):**
```
Find recent articles about administrative challenges for academic chairs in community colleges
```

**Key teaching moment:**
"Notice I said 'community colleges' not just 'higher education' - specificity matters."

**Show results:**
- Inside Higher Ed articles from 2025
- Point out themes: "This is you, right? Role ambiguity, limited training, crisis management?"
- "These are from August 2025 and February 2025 - very recent."

**Optional (if time):**
- Click "Create a summary report" to show follow-up capability
- "And if that's helpful, you can ask it to organize this into a summary."

**Transition:**
"Finding current information is one thing. But what about creating content?"

---

### Minutes 10-15: Demo 2 - Email Clarity

**Connect to pain:**
"How many of you write emails that could be clearer?" (expect laughs/nods)
"Students with varying literacy levels, EAL students - we need to write for OUR audience, not ourselves."

**Show original email:**
```
Subject: Program Planning Documentation Requirements

Dear Students,

This correspondence is to inform you that all students must complete and submit their Program Planning Forms (PPF) to the Academic Advising Office no later than Friday, January 10th, 2026, at 4:00 PM AST.

Failure to comply with this deadline will result in a registration hold being placed on your student account, thereby preventing you from accessing the course registration system for the upcoming semester...

[continue with full academic-ese version]
```

**Prompt (emphasize three specific instructions):**
```
Rewrite this email for grade 8 reading level while keeping all important information and deadlines. Make it clear and friendly.
```

**Show result - let them react:**
- Shorter subject line
- Bullet points instead of paragraphs
- "Please make sure to" instead of "This correspondence is to inform you"
- Clear, friendly tone

**Key points:**
- "This is humbling every single time I do it."
- "Same information, half the words, twice as clear."
- Privacy reminder: "This was a generic email. Draft generic, then customize with student names afterward."

**Teaching moment:**
"Notice my prompt had three specific asks: grade 8 level, keep all info, make it friendly. Specific prompts get better results."

**Transition:**
"So Copilot can find information and rewrite content. But can it help you THINK?"

---

### Minutes 15-22: Demo 3 - Reverse Prompting / Organizing Messy Thinking

**The setup:**
"This one's different. This is about using AI as a thinking partner when you have a fuzzy problem."

**Relatable scenario:**
"You have an hour of PD time this afternoon. You know there are things faculty need to cover, but your thoughts are scattered. Or you just came out of a meeting with half-complete notes and need to organize them."

**The technique - 4 steps:**

**Step 1: Brain Dump**
"First, I just dump everything into Copilot. It's messy, incomplete, whatever."

**Example prompt:**
```
I have an hour with faculty this afternoon to cover professional development. Here's what I'm thinking:
- Something about AI tools maybe
- Accessibility requirements changed
- New student success metrics we have to report on
- Somebody asked about rubric design last week
- Equity and inclusion training is mandatory this term
- Time management keeps coming up in complaints

Help me organize this into a coherent session plan.
```

**Step 2: Copilot Organizes**
Show how Copilot structures it:
- Groups related items
- Identifies themes
- Suggests priorities
- Points out what won't fit in an hour

**Step 3: Copilot Asks Clarifying Questions**
"Then I ask it to help me think it through."

**Follow-up prompt:**
```
Ask me smart one-at-a-time questions to help clarify what should be the focus for this session.
```

Show Copilot asking:
- "What's the most urgent concern faculty have expressed?"
- "Are any of these items required vs. optional?"
- "What's the skill level of your audience with the topics?"

**Step 4: Answer and Get Output**
"I answer based on my context, and Copilot formats the output."

**Final prompt:**
```
Based on my answers, create a 60-minute session outline with timing, key points to cover, and a realistic agenda.
```

**Why this works:**
- Turns fuzzy thinking into structure
- Works for: planning sessions, organizing meeting notes, developing ESPs, thinking through budget priorities
- **It's conversational** - most people don't know you can do this
- You're still the expert with context; AI is helping you organize

**Teaching moment:**
"First two demos, I asked Copilot to find or rewrite something. This one? I'm using it to help me THINK. That's the difference."

**Privacy note:**
"Notice I didn't mention student names, specific faculty complaints, or confidential issues. Keep it generic when brainstorming."

### Minutes 22-25: Wrap-Up & Pattern Recognition

**"See the pattern in all three?"**

**1. Specificity matters:**
- "Community colleges" not "higher ed"
- "Grade 8 level, keep info, friendly" - three specific asks
- Detailed brain dump gets better organization

**2. Different use cases:**
- **Finding:** Current research and best practices
- **Creating:** Clearer, more accessible writing
- **Thinking:** Organizing messy ideas into structure

**3. Web-grounded strengths:**
- Pulls from recent sources (2025 articles)
- Understands context (community college vs. university)
- Can have a conversation, not just answer one question

**4. This is table stakes:**
"These aren't advanced AI tricks. This is what you should be comfortable doing with the tool you already have access to."

**Optional mention if time:**
"There are other things you can do - like getting help with Excel formulas or analyzing data - but I wanted to focus on the three that save me the most time every week."

---

### Minutes 25-30: Q&A, Challenge, Close

**Open for questions:**
"What questions do you have about anything we tried?"

**Address the elephant in the room:**
"I know some of you are thinking 'this seems limited compared to what we hear about AI.' You're right. Web-grounded means we're playing it safe with data privacy. For more advanced stuff with your actual internal data, you'd need the licensed add-ons."

**The practical win:**
"But here's what you CAN do today with what we have:"
- Stay current with research
- Write clearer emails
- Organize your thinking
"That's not nothing."

**The challenge:**
"Here's your homework: pick ONE of these three things. Try it ONCE this week. Just once. See if it saves you 15 minutes."

**Close with positioning:**
"I'm not five years ahead of you on this. I'm five minutes ahead. The difference is I'm putting in the time to experiment within the boundaries we have."

**Offer to help:**
"If you try something and want to talk through it, reach out." [Drop email in chat]

## Safety Reminders to Emphasize Throughout

- ❌ Never paste student names, IDs, grades, or personal information
- ❌ Never paste confidential internal documents or meeting notes with names
- ❌ Never share sensitive budget details, personnel issues, or faculty complaints
- ✅ Draft generic versions, then add specific details manually afterward
- ✅ When brainstorming: describe the PROBLEM generically, not the specific people/details
- ✅ When in doubt: "Would I post this on Twitter?" - if not, don't put it in Copilot

## Backup Questions & Answers

**Q: "What about Copilot in Word/Outlook/Excel?"**
A: "Those require the licensed add-on that we don't have yet. Today we're using the standalone Copilot Chat which is available to everyone."

**Q: "Can I use this for grading/feedback?"**
A: "For generic rubric development or feedback templates, yes. For actual student work with names/grades, no - not with the web-grounded version."

**Q: "What if I want to do more?"**
A: "Talk to your department about approved tools with proper data handling. But start with what we have and see if it's useful first."

**Q: "Is this going to replace us?"**
A: "It's a tool, like Excel or email. It changes how we work, but it doesn't eliminate the need for your expertise and judgment. Notice in every demo - I still had to know what to ask, what was important, and what to do with the results."

**Q: "What about the Excel help you mentioned?"**
A: "You can absolutely ask Copilot for help with Excel formulas, pivot tables, data analysis techniques. It won't manipulate your data, but it'll teach you how. I focused on the three that are most broadly useful, but Excel help is definitely available."
