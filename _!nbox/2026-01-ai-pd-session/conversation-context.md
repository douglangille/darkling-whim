## Matt Taylor - 9:12 AM
Good morning, Doug. Do you need anything from me prior to the CTL/AC meeting Wednesday morning?

## Doug - 9:24 AM
I'm not sure... i forgot everything over my vacation. 😵 I think I'm fine to be able to provide a helpful session.. do you have a handful of specific trouble spots from an AC's perspective that I can address?

## Matt Taylor - 9:46 AM
I was reviewing the notes from the All Schools meeting we joined in October. I think a first "kick" at this could be focused on administrative tasks.

- Summarizing meeting notes is something they could likely use in developing ESPs
- Editing email for clarity: ensuring that messages sent are the right language for the audience reading level (both for overall literacy for students who have English as a first language, and students who use English as an additional language)
- If you think there's time to look at analyzing data in Excel....ACs have to run a lot of PeopleSoft Queries that send "big dumps" to excel.
- I'm not even sure many ACs would understand basic functionality around effective brainstorming: writing prompts that are going to lead them where they want to be

I genuinely suspect a significant number operate in the "There is a frigging Copilot button in the top right corner of every section of O365, but I have no idea what to do with it"

## Doug - 9:55 AM
ok.. so basic prompting, summarizing meeting notes and brain dumps, dense reading materials, reverse prompting.. pretty much table stakes stuff. The excel stuff might be over the head of a bunch of folks, but I'll see if I can some up with something.

## Matt Taylor - 9:56 AM
Yes....the excel might be too much to cram into 30 minutes. Best to cover 2-3 items well with time for questions. Thanks for doing this!

## Doug - 9:57 AM
happy to help spread The Good Word

## Key Takeaways from Conversation

1. **Audience pain point**: "Copilot button everywhere but no idea what to do with it"
2. **Focus on administrative tasks** - practical, immediate value
3. **Four potential topics identified:**
   - Summarizing meeting notes (for ESPs)
   - Editing email for clarity (literacy + EAL considerations)
   - Excel data analysis (PeopleSoft queries)
   - Basic prompting/brainstorming
4. **Time constraint**: 30 minutes, cover 2-3 items well with Q&A time
5. **Tone established**: "spread The Good Word" - enthusiastic but approachable

## Decision Points

- Keep Excel in as fourth topic but acknowledge it might be stretch
- Focus on "table stakes" applications
- Emphasize practical over theoretical
- Address the "I see the button but don't know what to do" problem directly
