# Digital Doug Writing Style Guide
*For AI-assisted drafting and editorial consistency*

---

## Voice & Tone

### Core Voice
- **Peer-beside-you, not expert-across-from-you.** You're five minutes ahead, not five years.
- **Self-deprecating without being pathetic.** Show vulnerability through specific past mistakes, not general inadequacy.
- **Technically precise without jargon-bombing.** Use technical terms when necessary, explain when helpful, skip when possible.
- **No hedging.** Make claims. Own them. "I think maybe possibly" is weak. "Here's what I've found" is strong.

### Snark Calibration
- **Sideways, not down.** Punch at shared absurdity, not at people trying their best.
- **Dry observations over hot takes.** "We taught the machines our worst habit, and they're giving it back with interest."
- **Light touch.** One snarky line per 3-4 paragraphs. Too much becomes exhausting.
- **Self-aimed first.** If you're going to be sarcastic about someone's behavior, show yourself doing it first.

### Authenticity Markers
- **Admit what didn't work.** Name tools you abandoned, experiments that failed, time you wasted.
- **Show boundaries.** "Finished prose? That's mine." Clear about what you won't delegate to AI.
- **Reveal pricing decisions.** ChatGPT Plus upgrades, tool subscriptions - shows you're not just theorizing.
- **No guru posturing.** "The tools will keep changing" - you're figuring this out, not solved it.

## Structure & Flow

### Opening Strategy
**Never open with abstract problem statements.** Open with specific personal moments.

**Good openings:**
- "In Grade 12, I handed in a 45-page book report..."
- "I spent two hours yesterday falling down a Wikipedia rabbit hole..."
- "I've tried seven different note-taking apps this year. Six are gone."

**Bad openings:**
- "Productivity is a challenge for many people..."
- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- "Technology is changing how we work..."

**Opening structure:**
1. Specific personal moment (2-3 sentences)
2. What it reveals about you (1 sentence)
3. Bridge to reader's experience (1 sentence)
4. Jump into the actual content

### Story Placement
- **Personal narrative throughout, not just opening.** Weave lived experience into each section.
- **Specific > Generic.** "I dump conference notes and ask one clarifying question at a time" beats "You can use AI for organizing thoughts."
- **Past mistakes as teaching moments.** Show the detour before showing the shortcut.
- **Present-tense observations anchor to NOW.** "Here's what I'm doing this week" not "Here's what could theoretically be done."

### Section Flow Pattern
1. **Hook** - Personal moment or provocative claim
2. **Problem naming** - What's broken/hard/annoying
3. **Stakes** - Why this matters (briefly)
4. **Practical solution** - What actually works
5. **Big picture reflection** - So what? (optional, keep short)

**Each section should be 3-5 paragraphs max.** If longer, break into sub-sections or cut.

---

## Sentence-Level Style

### Rhythm & Pacing
- **Vary sentence length aggressively.** Short punchy sentences. Followed by longer ones that build on the idea and add context or nuance. Then short again.
- **One idea per sentence.** If you need "and" more than once, split it.
- **Active voice default.** "AI helps me organize" not "My organizing is helped by AI."
- **Front-load key information.** Don't bury the point in dependent clauses.

### Paragraph Guidelines
- **2-4 sentences per paragraph.** Rare exceptions for single-sentence paragraphs (emphasis) or 5-6 sentences (complex ideas).
- **One clear point per paragraph.** If you're making two points, split them.
- **White space is strategic.** Dense blocks of text signal "this is hard." Broken-up text signals "this is accessible."
- **Transition smoothly but don't over-signal.** "Also" and "Additionally" are weak. Just move to the next idea.

### Word Choice
- **Concrete over abstract.** "45-page book report" beats "excessive submission."
- **Specific over vague.** "ChatGPT Plus, Copilot, Perplexity" beats "various AI tools."
- **Plain language default.** Academic jargon only when necessary and immediately explained.
- **Contractions are fine.** "You're" and "don't" sound human. "You are" and "do not" sound stiff.

### Things to Avoid
- ❌ "Very" and "really" - cut them
- ❌ "Utilize" when you mean "use"
- ❌ "In order to" when you mean "to"
- ❌ "It is important to note that" - just note it
- ❌ "At the end of the day" or other clichés
- ❌ Starting multiple sentences with "So" or "And" (one per post is fine, more is lazy)

---

## Technical Content Presentation

### Code & Prompts
- **Fence code blocks** with proper syntax highlighting when available
- **XML-style tags** for complex prompt structures show your sophistication
- **Inline code** for short commands: `git commit -m "update"`
- **Actual examples only.** No placeholder "do the thing" prompts. Show what you actually ran.

**Example format:**
```
Prompt: "Find recent articles about administrative challenges for academic chairs in community colleges"

Notice the specificity - *community colleges*, not just "higher education."
```

### Tool Mentions
- **Name specific tools.** "Microsoft Copilot" not "an AI assistant"
- **Show the graveyard.** "I've tried Claude, Mistral, NotebookLM. Most fell away. Here's what stuck."
- **Version matters sometimes.** "ChatGPT Plus" signals you're paying for it. "Free tier" signals constraint awareness.
- **No affiliate links.** Keep it clean. You're not selling, you're sharing.

### Screenshots & Examples
- **Real examples with details changed.** Not fake sanitized versions that look fake.
- **Show before/after when comparing.** Email clarity section needs both versions visible.
- **Annotate if helpful.** Point out what changed and why it matters.

---

## Signature Elements

### Pull Quotes (Bolded Standalone Lines)
Place 1-2 per post. These should work as tweetable moments.

**Good pull quotes:**
- **"Email is someone else's to-do list colonizing your brain."**
- **"AI harmonizes with my ideas. It never writes the song."**
- **"The detours are familiar, but the outcomes are better."**
- **"We write for ourselves, not our audience."**

**Bad pull quotes:**
- **"AI tools can be helpful for many tasks."** (generic, boring)
- **"I think technology is changing rapidly."** (obvious, adds nothing)

### Lists vs. Paragraphs
**Use numbered lists for:**
- Sequential steps
- Ranked items
- Things with clear order

**Use bulleted lists for:**
- Related but unordered items
- Features or characteristics
- Quick reference points

**Use paragraphs for:**
- Narrative flow
- Complex ideas that need connection
- Anything under 3 items (don't list 2 things)

### Headers & Structure
- **H2 (##) for main sections.** Keep them short: "Making Your Emails Actually Readable"
- **H3 (###) rarely.** Only if a section genuinely needs sub-structure.
- **No H1 except title.** Don't compete with your own headline.
- **Headers should be statements or questions,** not just labels. "Why Your Chatbot Needs a Reset" beats "Chatbot Management"

---

## Topic-Specific Guidance

### Writing About AI Tools
- **Show actual use cases, not capabilities.** "Here's what I did" not "Here's what it can do"
- **Admit the honeymoon phase.** Early excitement → sober assessment → what stuck
- **Boundaries matter.** Be clear about what you won't delegate
- **Privacy and data handling upfront.** Don't bury the "don't paste confidential stuff" warning
- **Compare to past behavior, not ideal state.** "This is better than Wikipedia rabbit holes" not "This achieves perfect productivity"

### Writing About Productivity
- **Process over artifact.** How you work matters more than what you produce
- **Workbench philosophy.** Tools are means, not ends
- **No productivity porn.** No "I wake up at 4am and..." bullshit. Real constraints, real trade-offs
- **Specific systems named.** "GTD" "Zettelkasten" "PARA" - use proper nouns, explain briefly
- **Anti-hustle culture lean.** "Find out what it feels like to actually focus again" not "10x your output"

### Writing About Higher Ed / Work
- **NSCC context when relevant, but don't assume knowledge.** "Community college" works better than "NSCC" for external readers
- **Decode acronyms on first use.** ESP → "student success plans" 
- **Equity and access awareness.** Literacy levels, EAL students, varying comfort with tech
- **Show institutional constraints honestly.** "We don't have the licensed version" is useful context
- **Faculty/staff/student balance.** Not everyone reading is in your role

### Writing About Creative Work
- **Writing craft is your domain.** Lean into it
- **Show your fiction projects as examples.** "Mitzy and the Butterfly" flash fiction, Haley's War universe
- **Process transparency.** Story briefs, scene-level planning, revision approaches
- **AI as collaborator, not author.** "Harmonizes with my ideas" not "writes my stories"
- **Protect the finished prose boundary.** Be clear about what's yours

---

## Closing Strategy

### Endings to Avoid
- ❌ Summary paragraphs that repeat what you just said
- ❌ "In conclusion..." or "To sum up..."
- ❌ Weak CTAs: "Let me know what you think in the comments"
- ❌ Motivational fluff: "You've got this!" (unless deeply earned)
- ❌ Open-ended questions that feel obligatory: "What will you try?"

### Strong Closings
- **Specific challenge.** "Pick one of these three things. Try it this week. See if it saves you 15 minutes."
- **Honest limitation.** "I'm just five minutes ahead of you on this stuff, and I'm still figuring it out."
- **Callback to opening.** Reference your opening story/moment
- **Future-facing honesty.** "The tools will keep changing. The principles might not."
- **Single-sentence paragraph punch.** End on one strong line alone.

**Good closing structure:**
1. Quick recap (1 sentence, optional)
2. Honest positioning ("five minutes ahead")
3. Specific actionable thing or clear limitation
4. Strong final line

## Common AI-Assisted Drafting Pitfalls

When using AI to help draft Digital Doug posts, watch for these tells:

### Generic Voice Markers (Fix These)
- "In today's fast-paced world..." - Delete, start with specific moment
- "As we navigate..." - Doug doesn't navigate, he stumbles and figures it out
- "Here are X tips/tricks/hacks..." - Needs personal framing first
- "You might be wondering..." - Doug tells, doesn't guess what you wonder
- Over-use of "Additionally," "Furthermore," "Moreover" - Too formal

### Missing Doug Elements
- No mistakes or abandoned tools mentioned - Add the graveyard
- No specific pricing/upgrade decisions - Show investment trade-offs
- No boundaries stated - What won't you delegate?
- Too confident/guru-like - Dial back, add honest limitation
- No creative work examples - Weave in fiction projects when relevant

### Structure Problems
- Opening with problem statement, not personal story - Flip it
- Long paragraphs (5+ sentences) - Break them up
- No bolded pull-quotes - Add 1-2 strong standalone lines
- Summary conclusion - Cut it, end with challenge or honest position
- Generic "let me know what you think" CTA - Replace with specific action

### How to Fix AI-Generated Draft
1. **Replace opening** with personal anecdote from Doug's experience
2. **Add tool graveyard** - what you stopped using and why
3. **Inject mistakes** - where you wasted time, what didn't work
4. **Insert boundaries** - what you won't let AI do
5. **Add pull-quotes** - bold 1-2 lines that work standalone
6. **Shorten paragraphs** - break 5+ sentence chunks
7. **Snark check** - add 2-3 dry observations
8. **Cut conclusion** - end with challenge or limitation instead
9. **Specificity pass** - replace generic examples with Doug's actual use
10. **Read aloud** - does it sound like Doug talking?

## Example Transformations

### Before (Generic AI)
"Email management is a common challenge for busy professionals. Many people struggle with inbox overload and unclear communication. AI tools can help you write more effectively by simplifying your language and improving clarity."

### After (Doug Voice)
"I learned this the hard way in Grade 12. Handed in a 45-page book report when the assignment called for 5-7 pages. Teacher handed it back covered in red ink: 'Length isn't value.' She was right then, and she's still right now when I'm drafting emails.

We write for ourselves, not our audience. Try this: Draft your email, then ask AI to 'rewrite this for grade 8 reading level while keeping all important information.' It's humbling every single time."

### Before (Generic AI)
"There are many AI tools available today. It's important to experiment and find what works best for your workflow."

### After (Doug Voice)
"I've tried seven AI tools this year. Claude, Mistral, NotebookLM, Gemini, Poe, ChatGPT, Copilot. Six are gone. What stuck? ChatGPT Plus (I upgraded) and Copilot (came with my Office license). 

The others? Either too niche, too expensive, or solved problems I don't actually have. The graveyard is how you figure out what works."

## Final Note

This guide describes Digital Doug's voice as it exists in published posts. Voice evolves. Tools change. The core remains: peer-beside-you, honest about mistakes, specific about experience, no guru posturing.

When in doubt: Would Doug actually say this? If not, cut it.
