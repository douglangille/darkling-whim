Subject: Program Planning Documentation Requirements

Dear Students,

This correspondence is to inform you that all students must complete and submit their Program Planning Forms (PPF) to the Academic Advising Office no later than Friday, January 10th, 2026, at 4:00 PM AST.

Failure to comply with this deadline will result in a registration hold being placed on your student account, thereby preventing you from accessing the course registration system for the upcoming semester. Students who do not submit their PPF in a timely manner will be required to meet with their academic advisor to discuss their academic trajectory and program requirements prior to the hold being removed.

The PPF can be accessed via the Student Portal under the "Academic Planning" tab. Should you encounter any technical difficulties or have questions regarding the completion of this form, please contact the Academic Advising Office during regular business hours (Monday-Friday, 8:30 AM - 4:30 PM).

Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,
Academic Advising Office

## Demo 3: Excel Help

### Option 1: Pivot Table (Recommended)

I have an Excel file with columns for Student Name, Course Code, Final Grade, and Attendance Percentage. I need to create a pivot table that shows me how many students in each course have grades below 60% AND attendance below 70%. Walk me through how to set this up.
```

### Option 2: Filter/Highlight
```
I have student data with columns: Student Name, Course Code, Grade (%), Attendance (%). I need to identify all students who have BOTH a grade below 60% AND attendance below 75%. What's the best way to filter or highlight these students in Excel?
```

### Option 3: VLOOKUP
```
I have two Excel sheets: one with student names and email addresses, another with student names and their current grades. How do I use a formula to pull the email address into the grades sheet so I can email students who are failing?
