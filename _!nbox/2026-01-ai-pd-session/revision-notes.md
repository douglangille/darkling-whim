# Blog Post Revision Notes - Session Summary
*January 6, 2026 - 4:00-6:32 PM*

## What We Did Today

### Phase 1: Style Guide Creation
- Created comprehensive Digital Doug Writing Style Guide (14.9KB)
- Based on Substack post analysis and established voice patterns
- Covers: Voice/tone, structure, sentence-level style, technical content, signature elements, topic guidance, closing strategy, editorial checklist, AI-drafting pitfalls
- Location: `digital-doug-style-guide.md`

### Phase 2: Interview for Personal Material
- Conducted 9-question interview to extract personal stories and narrative
- Captured: blank page problem, wife's ADHD/Goblin Tools, Mitzy story, $10 words habit, tool graveyard with pricing, long chat mistake, procrastination confession, boundaries ("finished prose is mine"), "I'm a nerd" admission
- Location: `interview-raw-material.md` (18.2KB)

### Phase 3: First Draft Injection
- Added personal stories throughout original draft
- Injected: new opening with multiple story threads, tool graveyard, pull quotes, "Saved My Bacon" section
- Result: 11.7KB, ~1,900 words (too long, unfocused)

### Phase 4: Editorial Analysis
- Identified 31 specific warts: structural issues, repetition, AI-isms, voice inconsistencies
- Major problems: opening too long (9 paragraphs), tool graveyard repeated twice, privacy warnings x3, "Saved My Bacon" section breaks structure, Excel feels tacked on

### Phase 5: Revision Planning (Smart Questions)
- Q1: Structure - chose "readability over word count"
- Q2: Opening hook - chose procrastination/tomorrow's presentation (strongest universal hook)
- Q3: Tool graveyard - brief in opening, full treatment in closing
- Q4: "Saved My Bacon" - cut entirely (redundant with new opening)
- Q5: Excel section - cut entirely (save for different post)
- Q6: Privacy warnings - consolidated into opening only, woven naturally
- Q7: Personal stories - added meeting notes example to Section 2, rabbit hole blend to Section 3
- Q8: Section 2 hook - Doug's use case: dumping meeting notes, AI interrogates for missing details
- Q9: Section 3 hook - blend of geopolitics doomscroll + higher ed rabbit hole
- Q10: Long Chat Mistake - fold into Section 2 flow, remove subsection header
- Q11: Pull quotes - keep "drunk" quote only, cut "information out"
- Q12: Closing callback - "I'm still a procrastinator. The tools just force me to be a better one."

### Phase 6: Major Revision Execution
- New opening: 5 paragraphs (was 9) - procrastination hook + tool boundaries + privacy
- Cut: Mitzy story, Goblin Tools, wife's ADHD, "Saved My Bacon" section, Excel Bonus
- Three clean sections: Email clarity, Reverse prompting, Research
- Personal stories distributed: $10 words (S1), meeting notes interrogation (S2), rabbit holes (S3)
- Eliminated repetition: tool graveyard once, privacy once, varied "brain dump" language
- Voice polish: removed AI-isms, formal callouts, subsection header
- Result: 9.1KB, ~1,500 words - readable, focused, consistent Doug voice
- Location: `blog-post.md`

## Current State of Blog Post

### Structure
- **Opening (5 paragraphs):** Procrastination confession → tomorrow's presentation → AI forces intention → tool boundaries + privacy warning
- **Section 1:** Making Your Emails Actually Readable (with $10 words story, Hemingway friction, "drunk" pull quote)
- **Section 2:** Organizing Your Messy Thinking / Reverse Prompting (with meeting notes example, PD planning, student project, long chat mistake woven in)
- **Section 3:** Finding Current Information (with geopolitics doomscroll + higher ed rabbit hole hook)
- **Closing:** Tool graveyard → what stuck → table stakes → specific challenge → procrastinator callback → "five minutes ahead"

### What's Working
- Procrastination hook is universal and immediate
- Three sections match title promise ("Three AI Tricks")
- Personal stories distributed throughout, not just opening
- Privacy handled once, naturally integrated
- Tool graveyard in closing shows experimentation cost
- "Drunk" pull quote is memorable and distinctly Doug
- Closing callback completes narrative arc
- Length is readable (~1,500 words)

## Next Steps for Doug

### Immediate Actions
1. **Read the revised post fresh** - does it sound like you talking?
2. **Check for remaining issues:**
   - Any AI-isms that slipped through?
   - Voice consistent throughout?
   - Personal stories feel natural or forced?
   - Examples resonate with your audience?

### Optional Polish Pass
3. **Title check** - "Three AI Tricks I'm Using (That You Probably Should Too)" - is this still the right title?
4. **Subheadings** - Do the three section titles work? "Making Your Emails Actually Readable" / "Organizing Your Messy Thinking" / "Finding Current Information"
5. **Opening tightness** - Can those 5 opening paragraphs be 4? Or are they right?
6. **Examples audit** - PD planning example, student group project - do these land for your audience or feel generic?

### Before Publishing
7. **Run through Editorial Checklist** (from style guide):
   - Does this sound like Doug, or could anyone have written it?
   - Is there at least one personal anecdote with specific details? (Yes - multiple)
   - Have I shown a mistake or limitation, not just wins? (Yes - procrastination, long chat mistake, rabbit holes)
   - Am I making claims or hedging? (Good - direct claims throughout)
   - Sentence length variety? (Check on fresh read)
   - Active voice 80%+? (Check on fresh read)
   - No more than 2-3 bolded pull-quotes? (Yes - only 1 now)
   - Strong final line that could stand alone? (Yes - "five minutes ahead" + hours saved)

8. **Final privacy/compliance check:**
   - No student names or confidential details in examples? ✓
   - Work/personal tool separation clear? ✓
   - Privacy warning prominent but not preachy? ✓

## Content Saved for Future Posts

### Mitzy and the Butterfly Story
- 10-year-old flash fiction about girl in maze rescuing sister, sarcastic butterfly Larry
- AI literary critique unlocked expansion into longer work
- Perfect for future post about "AI for Creative Writing" or "Using AI to Analyze Your Own Work"
- Shows: back-and-forth conversation, boundaries (AI doesn't write additions), unlocking stuck projects

### Wife's ADHD / Goblin Tools Discovery
- Wife recently diagnosed ADHD
- Showed Doug Goblin Tools (brain-dump-to-to-do-list)
- Led to realization: AI works for organizing thoughts, not just writing
- Could be future post about "AI as Accessibility Tool" or "Neurodiversity and AI"

### Excel Data Analysis
- Systems export massive Excel files
- Using AI to understand functions, create formulas, explain pivot tables
- Pasting sanitized sample data for pattern recognition
- Could be future post: "AI for Data Work When You're Not a Data Person"

### Additional "Save My Bacon" Moments
- Template: time AI helped rescue a meeting, caught an error, understood student feedback patterns
- Could collect 3-4 of these for "Times AI Actually Saved Me" post

## Key Insights from This Session

### What Makes Doug's Voice Work
1. **Peer-beside-you, not expert-across** - "I'm just five minutes ahead"
2. **Self-deprecating without pathetic** - "I'm a procrastinator" not "I'm broken"
3. **Specific over vague** - "$10 words when $0.10 words would do" not "I overcomplicate things"
4. **Show the graveyard** - Name abandoned tools with reasons why
5. **Boundaries stated clearly** - "Finished prose is mine" / work vs personal tool separation
6. **Mistakes as teaching moments** - Long chat drift, Hemingway app friction
7. **No guru posturing** - "The tools will keep changing" / still figuring it out

### Interview Technique That Worked
- One question at a time, wait for answer
- Follow-up based on what was said, not pre-planned list
- Ask for SPECIFIC moments, not general patterns
- Push back on vague answers: "Give me the actual rabbit hole example"
- Let subject say "I don't have that story" and pivot
- Mine for contradictions: "You said X but also Y - which is it?"

### Revision Process That Worked
1. Write first draft (even if generic)
2. Interview for personal material (extract stories)
3. Inject stories into draft (gets longer, messier)
4. Ruthless editorial analysis (pick apart every wart)
5. Smart questions to build revision plan (one decision at a time)
6. Execute plan (surgical edits, not rewrite)
7. Result: Personal voice + tight structure + readable length

## Tools & Workflow Notes

### What Worked Well
- GitHub MCP integration: Seamless file creation/updates
- Interview Q&A format: Drew out specific stories Doug wouldn't have volunteered
- Style guide as reference: Clear standards for "what's Doug voice"
- Revision plan before execution: Made hard cuts easier ("we already decided this")

### What Could Improve
- Context window management: By end of session, approaching limits
- File organization: Many files in one folder, could use subfolders
- Version history: Git commits good, but could tag major milestones

## For Next Session (New Chat)

### Start Here
1. Load `blog-post.md` - current draft

### Possible Next Steps
- Final polish pass (sentence-level edits)
- Title refinement if needed
- Subheading optimization
- Example strengthening (PD scenario, student project)
- Or: Doug reads and provides feedback, we do another revision

### Questions to Ask Doug
1. What's your gut reaction to the revised post?
2. Does it sound like you talking?
3. Any sections that still feel off?
4. Is the procrastination opening hitting right?
5. Do the three tricks still feel like the right three?
