## Question 1: The Shift from Interesting to Useful

**Q:** What was the actual moment that made you realize AI tools had shifted from "interesting tech thing" to "wait, this might actually save me time on boring work"?

**A:** I'm always frustrated with staring at a blank page and I tend to procrastinate and put stuff off. What I saw was the ability to actually just start brainstorming and take these random thoughts and then ask the AI to sort of help organize them. I went from random thoughts and seat-of-the-pants drafting all the way into structured outlining and building stuff with intention.

I saw that almost right away as soon as I saw the ability of these language models to write - I realized that the writing wasn't even the most important part. The most important part was actually just getting the shit out of my brain into some structure that could be organized and made better.

I don't know if it's a neurodiversity thing with me or if it's just how I think, but it definitely made a difference and I saw that almost immediately.

At the same time, I also see when I open up Word and something like that - I see like seven copies of a Copilot button everywhere. It's like throwing spaghetti at a wall. It drives me bananas. I don't think putting it in Word is actually the right place to do it because it's a thinking tool for me first and foremost, so I actually like to use things outside of the browser. But I can see how it can be useful as a sidebar companion within the Office suite. I just wish Microsoft would figure out what the best way was for people to work instead of just giving everybody everything everywhere.

## Question 2: The First "Oh Shit, This Works" Moment

**Q:** Think back to the first time you dumped messy thoughts into an AI and got back something structured that made you go "oh shit, this actually works." What was the actual project or task?

**A:** I have three situations for this, and some of them are actually quite recent, even though the revelation sort of came along before but I just didn't realize what it was.

One of the more recent things that I figured out was just brainstorming and randomly dumping my thoughts into an AI and getting it to sort stuff out. I actually kind of picked that up from my wife who was recently diagnosed with ADHD. She pointed me to a tool called Goblin Tools that basically had that kind of functionality of brain dump to to-do list kind of thing, and I started to do that right away - actually just use it to generate a to-do list to organize my thoughts. That was actually the first thing.

The idea of using it for organizing writing kind of came afterwards, but the idea of actually just using it to extract action items from random thoughts was the gold star moment for me. I said, "Well, that works for that, maybe it would work for trying to organize my prose and evaluate what I've written in the past."

So I went in through something that I've written 10 years ago and I asked it to provide a literary critique, and it came back with some very very interesting things. Then I got a conversation back-and-forth on what would actually make the story better. I stopped at the point of having it write the additions, of course, because I actually like to do the actual drafting myself. But it was kind of a key thing.

From then on I started trying everything - meeting notes, random thoughts - and then have the AI ask me what I missed, what I thought was missing in my notes, and then I would fill in the gaps. So the idea of reverse prompting really really took hold when I started trying to make my notes better.

## Question 3: The 10-Year-Old Story

**Q:** What story was it? And what did the AI critique say that surprised you?

**A:** I have a couple pieces that I threw in there - a couple of unfinished novels that I've been trying to write for years. I'm just stuck in the messy middle of it even though I did some planning on some of the work and wrote very episodic, piece by piece. But I just couldn't get it. The middle part of any long writing project is really the hardest part.

I used AI to try and help me analyze and fill in the gaps. But one of the first things that I did was I took one of my favourite stories - the one I was most proud of - "Mitzy and the Butterfly" - and I put it in there and I asked it to provide a critique.

When I wrote that story, I always thought that there was more to it, that there was something else I could write. It felt well-written to me. To anybody else who would've read it, they thought it was good. It just felt like it could be more.

So I cranked it in there and I asked for some ideas, and now I have a much longer piece of work in progress because I was able to do the critique analysis and get some ideas and then my own brain took over and filled in the blanks. It was that back-and-forth conversation with the AI that did it.

**Story synopsis:** "Mitzy and the Butterfly" is a story where this 10-year-old girl wakes up at the entrance of a maze and realizes that her little sister is lost in the maze somewhere. She has to travel through the maze to try and rescue her, but this crazy butterfly named Larry comes down and gives her advice - and he is a very sarcastic kind of creature. The whole story is really all about sibling rivalry and family dynamics in this crazy fever dream fantasy setting. It was way more material here than what belonged in flash fiction, and that's what I'm building up upon.

## Question 4: The Email Realization

**Q:** Think about the first time you ran one of your own emails through AI and asked it to simplify. What was your "oh god, I sound like THAT?" moment?

**A:** One of the habits that I have is using $10 words when $0.10 words would do the job. I often use language and words for how they sound as much as for their meaning - it's a whole affect that I have to communicate persuasively. But I tend to use more complicated words than required and sometimes it gets lost.

I already knew that there were a few things that I could do to improve my email communication - like bottom line up front stuff, using the inverted pyramid newspaper article style for long emails and all of that stuff - but I still couldn't write simply.

So I ran a couple long emails that I was writing through an AI at the time - probably ChatGPT, I can't remember - and it came back and was scathing about what I needed to write, that I had to bring it down to a reading level that was more accessible.

Previously, I used the Hemingway app as a way to write at a reading level and force myself to write shorter sentences, but it was always something that I had to go to an external web browser and webpage, paste the copy I wanted to put in there, and then clean up all the complicated sentences and heavy jargon. But it would always be incomplete and it was always an extra step, an extra tool.

But using Copilot - putting that kind of communication clarity tool right in the application - that's gold right there. And I think I've gotten better at communicating complex things simply. To be honest, it actually just helped me in presentations and stuff like that because I take the time to take my writing and run it through that.

I also take my presentation material and run it through an AI to make sure that I'm targeting the audiences that I'm presenting to at a proper reading level and understanding level. That seems to help. Presentations are a little less blink blink.

## Question 5: The Tool Graveyard

**Q:** Give me your actual list. What AI tools have you tried, which ones did you pay for, and which ones are gone now? Pick ONE that you abandoned and tell me specifically why it didn't stick.

**A:** I've used a bunch of tools over the last little while. I actually paid for ChatGPT Plus for the longest time - best part of six months, and I guess that's a long time in the AI world - but it was really expensive, especially in Canadian dollars. The price was just too much and I was always worried that the free tier might be enough. So I unsubscribed to it and I tried to work with the free tools for a while, and still do.

But it's really become obvious that ChatGPT and Gemini and Claude all do very different things. Gemini is a great analysis tool, ChatGPT is a great conversationalist, and Claude is just a great thinker and brainstormer. I've used Mistral because I do like the fact that it's uncensored - some of the stuff I write is in the dark fantasy and horror realm, so when I'm brainstorming stuff, I need to not have my large language model nag me.

But in December, I got a free one-year subscription to Perplexity Pro, which has access to GPT and Claude models and Gemini models all within the tool as well as its own. Its router tends to move things back-and-forth to the different tools for what I'm doing actually pretty well. So I'll be using Perplexity for the most part for this next year, and then I'll figure out what I'm gonna do in December 2026.

I still think that Gemini and ChatGPT have the best mobile apps for the phone because they're multimodal and you can use your camera and voice talk and stuff like that. Claude I'm only gonna use in the browser, same with Mistral in the browser when I want to do a particular creative piece of work that I need their particular skills for.

I'm not a big coder, although I do do some vibe coding from time to time. But I think for the most part, I'm torn all the time - I'm always flipping back-and-forth between Gemini and ChatGPT and Gemini and ChatGPT. I can't decide which is the better tool. Yesterday it was Gemini, today it's ChatGPT. Tomorrow, who knows. But I'll probably need to settle down on what I'm going to use for a while.

Pretty happy with Perplexity right now. The thing that really has sold me on it is that I can wire it to my GitHub repository. I have a private GitHub repository where all my notes are and I've been writing in markdown and notes in that repository for the best part of a decade now. So this actually reduced a whole bunch of friction for me by having an AI tool help me not write my notes per se, but to help me organize them and to interrogate them and get value out of it.

One of the biggest problems with any database or personal knowledge management system is searching or retrieval. It's never about putting the information in. It's always about getting the information out.

## Question 6: The Mistake/Waste

**Q:** Tell me about a time you wasted an afternoon (or more) trying to get AI to do something it just couldn't do well, or that you realized afterward you should have just done yourself.

**A:** It took me a lot longer than I care to admit that I needed to treat the AI tools as more than just Google, and that I needed to not just have query-based, keyword-based searches that didn't really work - and it doesn't really work for anybody.

Something else I tried when I had my ChatGPT subscription: I really tried to have a chat that was dedicated to a particular topic and I would do everything in this one long chat. Sometimes it was managing my tool set, sometimes it was doing story development or whatever. It took me a while to figure out that this was a bad idea.

The thing that made it a bad idea was the context window - that the AI will start to drift, it would start to forget what happened earlier in the story. Managing the context was something I would end up having to go back and remind the AI, and then remind the AI, and then remind the AI of what it was supposed to be remembering and staying on track. And that wasn't working either.

So I had to learn how to be clear about my instructions so that I could do more things at once. I liked to trust the AI that it could do what I needed to do and then do it and then get out.

Some of the other things that just weren't working for me that I've had to figure out is that I was trying to be too specific sometimes and I would not give the AI enough latitude to be able to figure it out. At the end of the day it's: What do you want? How do you want it done? And what is the intention?

Giving the AI the intention so that it's like "oh wait, what the user is asking for is stupid - I know a better way" - the AI can figure it out based on my intention. So giving it a real goal is the most important thing, and it took me a while to figure that was the right way to go.

## Question 7: The Boundary

**Q:** Has there been a moment where you were tempted to just let AI write something for you but stopped yourself? Or have you crossed that line and regretted it?

**A:** There's some emails and some work documents that I've let the AI write. I mean, I've read it. I've edited it. But I mean I've let it do the outlining and the drafting and then not spent a whole lot of time on it.

And I always come to regret it because when somebody asks me about the detail later, I don't have it in my head - which is important, to be able to have it in your head, to be able to explain it. There's nothing worse than just putting stuff out there and not knowing what you wrote. I might as well be drunk.

But because I am a fiction writer, I do value my own thoughts, my own brainstorming, my own ideas, and my own words. So I've always kind of said, "OK well, I'm gonna have a line where I'm going to do the drafting myself."

It's been a couple times where I've let it write the shitty first draft and generate the outline and then delete the draft and then write it myself as a clean document. So that's been an interesting approach because I just want the words to be mine.

But yeah, I'm always tempted because the pressure is always there to produce and to publish and to get stuff out there and move onto the next task. But I try to focus that quality over quantity matters, that a sense of craftsmanship needs...

The one thing that I bring to the game that no robot can do - that's it. It looks pretty darn good with the automatic responses for yes and no and "find a time in my calendar" kind of stuff. So there are times when the transactional kind of emails just pick the right response from a picklist to go along with life. So I think it's a matter of picking your battles.

I should also note that for my work I use almost exclusively Copilot, but for my blogging and my living my life and my creative writing and any other outside-of-work tasks, I will actually use all the others from time to time. I will use non-Copilot tools for work-related projects that are in the public domain.

But I think it's really really important that I keep intellectual property and privacy concerns within the tool that is approved by the college.

## Question 8: The Save

**Q:** Tell me about one specific time - preferably recent - where using AI actually saved your ass.

**A:** I am a procrastinator at heart. I tend to put stuff off to the last minute. I like to tell myself that I work better under pressure, which is bullshit because no one works better under pressure - literally no one. It's a lie we all tell ourselves, the procrastinating group of us.

But really, if I take the time to plan things, I get a better result.

Whenever I was giving presentations for the longest time, I would either A) over-prepare and give myself so much time that I would actually psych myself out, or B) give myself no time to prepare and literally just fly by the seat of my pants, and that would be a disaster. I would have all kinds of "ums" and "ahs" and stuff like that. And while that all adds to the flavour of the absent-minded professor kind of affect I put off sometimes, it isn't really the great way to roll.

Even the presentations I've been giving - a lot of presentations on AI and productivity over the last couple of months - I have to do them a lot. I try to tailor them to the individual audiences and try not to seat-of-the-pants do things, but I still don't tend to think too much ahead of time.

For example, the presentation I'm giving tomorrow morning - I didn't start preparing for it until the day before.

But AI has been an invaluable assistant because I'm able to use it as a conversational tool to go back-and-forth, to iterate through, to test, to refine, brainstorming ideas and actually make things work.

So in a lot of ways, using the AI didn't speed up my process - in fact, if anything it slowed me down - but it enforced me to think about things with intention.

But the most important thing that AI has done to save my bacon has been to actually get me to do the process to begin with. Because if I didn't use AI to do the process planning, I wouldn't do it, and then I would go by the seat of my pants and deliver a serviceable but not great presentation.

## Question 9: Why This Matters to You

**Q:** You didn't have to figure out AI. You could have ignored it. So why did you put in the time? What's the throughline that connects IT manager Doug, fiction writer Doug, and "five minutes ahead" experimenter Doug?

**A:** Well, first off: I'm a nerd. That's the tweet.

I am addicted to novelty and once I start learning things I can't stop. So I saw a new tool. I saw some immediate potential and some quick wins. I got the big splash of dopamine, just giving my brain a nice comfy bath, and then I went for it.

There was never going to be an option where I wasn't going to investigate these tools. It was never gonna be the case.

Before AI, I was all-in on graphic design, all-in on productivity skills, all-in on visual graph design, all-in on coaching, all-in on thinking frameworks. It didn't matter. I would've been all-in on this to begin with.

At the same time, there were some real practical things: Being able to take unorganized thoughts and make them structured - huge win. Being able to deal with a blank page - huge win.

And I also saw it almost immediately as a way to help people. My wife's story, my kids' stories, people around the neurodiversity and ADHD - I see this as a unique equalizer.
