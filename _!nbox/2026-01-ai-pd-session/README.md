# AI PD Session & Blog Post - January 2026

## Purpose
Material for a 30-minute professional development session to CTL/AC at NSCC on January 8, 2026, plus a companion Digital Doug blog post.

## Context
- **Session Date**: Wednesday, January 8, 2026 (morning)
- **Audience (Session)**: Academic Chairs and Centre for Teaching and Learning staff at NSCC
- **Delivery**: Teams meeting with browser screen share
- **Tool**: Microsoft Copilot Chat for Enterprise (Education) - web-grounded, no licensed add-ons
- **Audience (Blog)**: Mixed internal (NSCC staff/faculty/students) and external (LinkedIn, general public)

## Core Topics
Based on conversation with Matt Taylor about practical AI use cases for administrative tasks:

1. **Summarizing meeting notes** - for developing ESPs and action items
2. **Editing email for clarity** - ensuring messages match audience reading levels (literacy + EAL)
3. **Analyzing data in Excel** - working with PeopleSoft query exports
4. **Effective brainstorming** - writing prompts that lead to productive outcomes

## Positioning
"I'm just 5 minutes ahead" - peer-to-peer enthusiastic experimenter, not SME or authority figure. Focused on practical, table-stakes applications that save time.

## Key Constraints
