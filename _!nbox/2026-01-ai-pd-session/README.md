# AI PD Session & Blog Post - January 2026

## Purpose
Material for a 30-minute professional development session to CTL/AC at NSCC on January 8, 2026, plus a companion Digital Doug blog post.

## Context
- **Session Date**: Wednesday, January 8, 2026, 9:00 AM AST
- **Audience (Session)**: Academic Chairs and Centre for Teaching and Learning staff at NSCC
- **Delivery**: Teams meeting with browser screen share
- **Tool**: Microsoft Copilot Chat for Enterprise (Education) - web-grounded, no licensed add-ons
- **Blog Publishing**: Wednesday, January 8, 2026, 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM (after session)
- **Audience (Blog)**: Mixed internal (NSCC staff/faculty/students) and external (LinkedIn, general public)

## Workflow Strategy

### Session-First Approach
Focus on the PD session first, then refine the blog post based on what works in practice.

**Rationale:**
1. Hard deadline with live audience - session must work tomorrow morning
2. Demo testing reveals what actually works vs. what sounds good on paper
3. Audience Q&A and reactions inform blog emphasis and examples
4. 30-minute constraint forces clarity on what matters most
5. Blog benefits from real-world testing and feedback

### Timeline

**Tuesday, January 7 (afternoon)**
- [ ] Refine session outline based on any additional context
- [ ] Test all demos in actual Microsoft Copilot Chat
- [ ] Document what works smoothly vs. what's clunky
- [ ] Adjust session outline based on demo testing
- [ ] Prepare backup examples if primary demos fail

**Wednesday, January 8 (morning - before 9am)**
- [ ] Final review of session outline
- [ ] Browser prep: Copilot Chat open, prompts ready
- [ ] Mental checklist of key safety reminders

**Wednesday, January 8 (9:00 AM)**
- [ ] Deliver 30-minute PD session
- [ ] Note what resonates, what confuses, what questions arise
- [ ] Observe which demos get strongest reactions

**Wednesday, January 8 (10:00 AM - 12:00 PM)**
- [ ] Update blog post with insights from session
- [ ] Add any relevant audience reactions or questions
- [ ] Incorporate examples that worked best in demos
- [ ] Final polish and fact-check
- [ ] Publish to Digital Doug
- [ ] Share on LinkedIn
- [ ] Share in internal NSCC channels

## Core Topics
Based on conversation with Matt Taylor about practical AI use cases for administrative tasks:

1. **Summarizing meeting notes** - for developing ESPs and action items
2. **Editing email for clarity** - ensuring messages match audience reading levels (literacy + EAL)
3. **Analyzing data in Excel** - working with PeopleSoft query exports
4. **Effective brainstorming** - writing prompts that lead to productive outcomes

## Positioning
"I'm just 5 minutes ahead" - peer-to-peer enthusiastic experimenter, not SME or authority figure. Focused on practical, table-stakes applications that save time.

## Files
- `blog-post.md` - Digital Doug blog post draft (to be refined post-session)
- `session-outline.md` - 30-minute PD session outline (primary focus)
- `conversation-context.md` - Original Teams conversation with Matt Taylor
- `README.md` - This file
- `demo-testing-notes.md` - (Create during demo testing) Notes on what works/doesn't

## Key Constraints
- Web-grounded Copilot cannot access internal documents or confidential data
- Must emphasize data privacy and appropriate use
- Keep demos generic/public to avoid confidentiality issues
- Acknowledge limitations while showing practical value

## Success Metrics

**For Session:**
- At least one person tries one technique within the week
- Questions indicate understanding (not confusion)
- Feedback suggests value for time invested

**For Blog:**
- Post reflects what actually worked in practice
- Includes real audience insights from session
- Provides value to both internal and external readers
- Drives engagement (comments, shares, follow-up questions)
