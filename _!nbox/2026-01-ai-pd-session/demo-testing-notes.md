## Demo 2: Email Clarity - Grade 8 Reading Level

### Status: ✅ TESTED & WORKING BEAUTIFULLY

### Original Email (Academic-ese):
```
Subject: Program Planning Documentation Requirements

Dear Students,

This correspondence is to inform you that all students must complete and submit their Program Planning Forms (PPF) to the Academic Advising Office no later than Friday, January 10th, 2026, at 4:00 PM AST.

Failure to comply with this deadline will result in a registration hold being placed on your student account, thereby preventing you from accessing the course registration system for the upcoming semester. Students who do not submit their PPF in a timely manner will be required to meet with their academic advisor to discuss their academic trajectory and program requirements prior to the hold being removed.

The PPF can be accessed via the Student Portal under the "Academic Planning" tab. Should you encounter any technical difficulties or have questions regarding the completion of this form, please contact the Academic Advising Office during regular business hours (Monday-Friday, 8:30 AM - 4:30 PM).

Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,
Academic Advising Office
```

### Prompt Used:
```
Rewrite this email for grade 8 reading level while keeping all important information and deadlines. Make it clear and friendly.
```

### Result:
```
Subject: Program Planning Form – Due January 10

Dear Students,

Please make sure to complete and submit your Program Planning Form (PPF) by Friday, January 10, 2026, at 4:00 PM AST.

If you miss this deadline:
• A registration hold will be placed on your account.
• You will not be able to register for next semester's courses until the hold is removed.
• To remove the hold, you'll need to meet with your academic advisor to review your program plan.

You can find the PPF in the Student Portal under the "Academic Planning" tab.

If you have any questions or run into technical problems, please contact the Academic Advising Office during business hours:
Monday–Friday, 8:30 AM – 4:30 PM.

Thank you for taking care of this on time!

Academic Advising Office
```

### What Changed:
- Subject line: Clear, concise, deadline-focused
- Opening: "This correspondence is to inform you" → "Please make sure to"
- Structure: Dense paragraphs → Bullet points for consequences
- Language: "Failure to comply", "thereby preventing", "academic trajectory" → Plain language
- Tone: Formal/bureaucratic → Clear and friendly
- Formatting: Better use of whitespace and bullets

### Follow-Up Offered by Copilot:
- "Add bold highlights for key dates"
- "Create a version for SMS reminders"
- "Simplify the tone further"

### Why This Works:
- Dramatic, visible improvement that's immediately obvious
- Addresses real accessibility and literacy concerns

## Demo 3: Reverse Prompting / Brainstorming

### Status: ✅ TESTED & WORKING - IT'S A KEEPER!

### Prompt Used (Step 1 - Brain Dump):
```
I have an hour with faculty this afternoon to cover professional development. Here's what I'm thinking:
- Something about AI tools maybe
- Accessibility requirements changed
- New student success metrics we have to report on
- Somebody asked about rubric design last week
- Equity and inclusion training is mandatory this term
- Time management keeps coming up in complaints

Help me organize this into a coherent session plan.
```

### What Copilot Delivered:

**Session Title:** "Faculty Development Hour – Practical Tools & Updates"

**Organized Structure:**
1. Welcome & Objectives (5 min)
2. AI Tools for Teaching (10 min)
3. Accessibility Updates (10 min)
4. Student Success Metrics (10 min)
5. Rubric Design Basics (10 min)
6. Equity & Inclusion Training (10 min)
7. Time Management Hacks (5 min)
8. Q&A and Wrap-Up (5 min)

**Each section included:**
- What: Brief description
- Why: Rationale
- Action: Specific takeaway

**Bottom Line Summary:** Clear outcomes for faculty

**Follow-Up Offered:**
- "Turn this into a polished handout (PDF)"
- "Create a PowerPoint deck for the session"
- "Draft a quick email invite with this agenda"

### Step 2 Test (Clarifying Questions):

**Prompt:**
```
Ask me smart one-at-a-time questions to help clarify what should be the focus for this session.
```

**Result:** ✅ WORKS - Copilot asks meaningful clarifying questions

### Why This Works:

**Organizational Power:**
- Turned messy brain dump into structured 60-minute agenda
- Time-blocked realistically
- Prioritized content
- Called out what doesn't fit (Time Management = 5 min)
- Added What/Why/Action framework

**Shows New Capability:**
- Most people think AI = "ask question, get answer"
- This shows AI = "have conversation, think together"
- Conversational/iterative approach is surprising
- "Reverse prompting" - you dump info, AI asks YOU questions

**Broadly Applicable:**
- Planning PD sessions
- Organizing meeting notes
- Developing ESP strategies
- Thinking through budget priorities
- Structuring course design
- Clarifying any fuzzy problem

**Differentiated from Other Demos:**
- Demo 1: AI finds information (research)
- Demo 2: AI rewrites content (email)
- Demo 3: AI helps you THINK (brainstorming)

### Demo Strategy:

**The Setup:**
"This one's different. This is about using AI as a thinking partner when you have a fuzzy problem."

**Show the messy brain dump:**
- Read it out loud: "Something about AI tools maybe..."
- "This is real - how many of you plan sessions like this?"

**Show Copilot's organization:**
- Scroll through the structured output
- Point out: "60 minutes, time-blocked, each section has purpose"
- "Notice it called out Time Management only gets 5 min - it knows what fits"

**Optional Step 2 (if time):**
- Ask for clarifying questions
- Show 1-2 questions Copilot asks
- "This is reverse prompting - I dump, it asks ME questions"

**If running short on time:**
- Stop after showing the organized output
- "And if I wanted, I could ask it to ask ME clarifying questions to refine this further"
- Move to wrap-up

**Key talking points:**
- "First two demos, Copilot did the work. This one? Copilot helps me THINK."
- "You're the expert with context. AI helps you organize."
- "It's conversational - most people don't know you can do this."
- Privacy reminder: "Notice no student names, no specific faculty complaints, no confidential issues."

### Alternative Scenario (Backup if PD planning doesn't land):

**Meeting Notes Organization:**
```
I just came out of a meeting about student retention. My notes are messy:
- Early alert system isn't working well
- Faculty don't know how to refer students
- Counselling is overwhelmed
- Something about peer mentoring program
- Budget concerns were mentioned
- Someone said we need data
- First-year students particularly at risk

Help me organize these notes and identify what needs follow-up action.
```

## Demo 4: Excel Help - REMOVED FROM SESSION

### Status: ✅ TESTED BUT MOVED TO BLOG POST ONLY

### Why Removed:
- Matt said "Excel might be too much to cram into 30 minutes"
- Only teaches (doesn't do) - creates expectation mismatch
- Reverse prompting demo is higher value for broader audience
- Too technical for 30-minute intro session

### Where It Lives Now:
- Available in blog post with full walkthrough
- Mentioned briefly in wrap-up: "You can also get Excel help"
- Follow-up resource if people ask

### Original Excel Prompt (for reference):
```
I have an Excel file with columns for Student Name, Course Code, Final Grade, and Attendance Percentage. I need to create a pivot table that shows me how many students in each course have grades below 60% AND attendance below 70%. Walk me through how to set this up.
```

**What it taught:** Helper column technique, pivot table setup, step-by-step Excel guidance

- Set expectation: "We're using web-grounded Copilot - no licensed add-ons, playing it safe with privacy"
- Positioning: "I'm 5 minutes ahead, not an expert. I'm just experimenting."
- "We're going to look at three practical uses you can try this week"

### Minute 5-10: Demo 1 - Research
- "Let's start by seeing what's current about YOUR challenges"
- Show prompt, emphasize specificity: "community colleges, not just higher ed"
- Show results - Inside Higher Ed articles
- Point out themes: "This is you, right? Role ambiguity, limited training?"
- Optional: Click "Create a summary report"
- Transition: "Finding info is one thing. Creating content?"

### Minute 10-15: Demo 2 - Email Clarity
- "Who writes emails that could be clearer?" (expect laughs/nods)
- Show original academic email
- Point out prompt: "grade 8 level, keep info, make friendly - three specific asks"
- Show result
- Let them react to the difference
- Privacy reminder: "Generic email. Don't paste student names."
- "This is humbling every time"

### Minute 15-22: Demo 3 - Reverse Prompting
- "This one's different. Using AI as a thinking partner for fuzzy problems."
- Relatable scenario: "You have PD this afternoon, thoughts are scattered"

  - Creating (writing)
  - Thinking (organizing)
- **Conversational**: Not just Q&A, back-and-forth
- "This is table stakes, not advanced AI"
- Brief mention: "You can also get Excel help - that's in the blog post"

### Minute 25-30: Q&A & Challenge
- "Questions?"
- Honest about limitations: "Web-grounded = privacy-safe but limited"
- "But research, writing, organizing thinking - that's real value TODAY"
- **The challenge**: "Pick ONE. Try it ONCE this week."

## Key Talking Points

- "Notice how specific the prompt was..."
- "This is web-grounded, so no confidential data..."
- "First two demos, Copilot did the work. This one, Copilot helps me think."
- "You're the expert with context; AI helps you organize..."
- "It's conversational - most people don't know you can do this..."
- "This is table stakes, not advanced AI..."
- "I'm five minutes ahead, experimenting..."
- "This is humbling every time..."

---

## Emergency Backup Plan

**If Copilot is slow/broken:**
- Have screenshots of successful results ready
- Walk through what you tested: "Here's what it gave me yesterday..."
- The conversation about possibilities is still valuable

**If running long:**
- Skip "Create summary report" in Demo 1
- Don't show Step 2 (clarifying questions) in Demo 3
- Shorten wrap-up, extend Q&A

**If running short:**
- Show "Create summary report" in Demo 1
- Show clarifying questions in Demo 3
- Do bad vs. good prompt comparison in wrap-up

**Demo 3 flexibility:**
- **Minimum version (3 min):** Just show brain dump → organized output
- **Full version (7 min):** Brain dump → organized output → clarifying questions → refined output
- **Backup scenario:** Switch to meeting notes organization if PD planning doesn't land

**Lean into authenticity:**
- If something breaks: "This is why I say I'm experimenting - let's try again"
- The "5 minutes ahead" positioning gives you permission to not be perfect
