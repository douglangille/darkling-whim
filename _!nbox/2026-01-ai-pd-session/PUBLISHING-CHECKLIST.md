I'm still procrastinating. The tools just make it look intentional.

New post about the three AI tricks that actually save me time—not the fancy stuff, just the boring everyday tasks that work.

🔹 Making emails readable (without the $10 words)
🔹 Organizing messy thinking (reverse prompting)
🔹 Finding current info (without rabbit holes)

No custom GPTs. No prompt engineering jargon. Just practical use.
