# 2026 Roadmap: Stabilize & Secure

## 1. Annual Vision & Anchors
* **Primary Infrastructure Goal:** Construct the **Goat Pasture and Shade** to end leash-grazing.
* **The "No" List (Deferred to 2027+):**
    * New Chicken Coop (Tabled to 2027; existing coop enters maintenance mode).
    * Luxury Upgrades: Pergola, new front/back doors, and shower enclosure.
    * Expansion: No new animals, no rabbit breeding.
* **Long-Term Logic:** The Farm Stand is officially deferred until one of you retires.
* **Rat Mitigation:** Execute the **hardware cloth perimeter** around the foundation as a non-negotiable labor priority.

## 2. Financial Guardrails (The "Rules")
* **The Checkpoint:** March 2026 Review.
* **The Debt Floor:** Reach a Home Line of Credit (HLOC) balance of **below $20,000** before major project spending.
* **The "Big Three" Gate:** Clear the House Taxes, House Insurance (in full), and Car Insurance (in full).
* **Safety Net:** Maintain the bi-weekly cash envelope system for Gas, Groceries, and "Doug/Rhonda" money.
* **Lydia Support:** Capped at surplus grocery cards and employee discounts.
