# SERIAL Bootstrap

**Purpose**: Manage serialized fiction - multi-part stories, episodic releases, novel published in installments.

**Method**: Balance standalone episode satisfaction with overarching series arc.

---

## When to Use This Bootstrap

- Writing serialized story (web serial, Substack, etc.)
- Publishing novel in installments/chapters
- Creating episodic content with ongoing arc
- Building story universe across multiple releases
- Need to track continuity across many parts

---

## Serial Development Workflow

### Phase 1: SERIES ARCHITECTURE
**Goal**: Define overall series structure

**Tasks**:

**Step 1: Series Scope**
- **Format**: 
  - Ongoing (no planned end)
  - Limited series (X episodes)
  - Novel serialization (chapter-by-chapter)
  - Season structure (multiple seasons)
- **Episode length**: Words per installment
- **Release schedule**: Frequency
- **Total planned scope**: Total word count / episode count

**Step 2: Series Premise**
- **Central concept**: What's this series about?
- **Ongoing hook**: What keeps readers coming back?
- **Series question**: What overarching mystery/conflict drives it?
- **World**: What makes this setting interesting long-term?

**Step 3: Series Structure**
- Choose macro structure:
  - **Linear arc**: Beginning to end
  - **Seasonal arcs**: Self-contained seasons
  - **Anthology**: Connected standalone episodes
  - **Braided**: Multiple storylines
  - **Episodic with arc**: Monster-of-week plus season arc

**Step 4: Arc Planning**
- **Season/Book arcs**: Map major story movements
- **Mid-level arcs**: 3-5 episode storylines
- **Micro arcs**: Single episode stories
- Ensure nested structure:
  - Each episode satisfies (micro arc completes)
  - While advancing mid-level arc
  - Which builds toward season/series arc

**Deliverables**:
- `series-bible.md` (series overview)
- `arc-structure.md` (nested arc planning)

**Status Check**: ✅ Complete when series architecture defined

### Phase 2: WORLD & CHARACTER BUILDING
**Goal**: Create consistent universe and cast

**Tasks**:

**Step 5: World Bible**
- **Setting details**:
  - Geography
  - History
  - Rules (magic/tech/social)
  - Factions/organizations
  - Locations (recurring)
- **Consistency tracking**:
  - What can/can't change
  - What rules must stay consistent
  - Timeline tracking

**Step 6: Character Database**
- **Protagonist(s)**:
  - Full character profile
  - Series-long character arc
  - Episode-level growth
  - Voice consistency notes
- **Supporting cast**:
  - Recurring characters
  - Relationship dynamics
  - Individual arcs
  - Appearance schedule
- **Antagonist(s)**:
  - Motivation
  - Resources
  - Long-term plan
  - Episode-level schemes

**Step 7: Series Continuity**
- **Timeline**: Master chronology
- **Event log**: What happened when
- **Character knowledge**: Who knows what
- **Callback opportunities**: Plant/payoff tracking
- **Foreshadowing log**: Setup for future episodes

**Deliverables**:
- `world-bible.md` (complete world reference)
- `characters/` (character profiles)
- `continuity.md` (timeline and tracking)

**Status Check**: ✅ Complete when universe is documented

---

### Phase 3: EPISODE STRUCTURE
**Goal**: Design repeatable episode template

**Tasks**:

**Step 8: Episode Template**
- **Act structure** for single episode:
  - Opening hook
  - Episode conflict introduction
  - Rising action
  - Episode climax
  - Resolution (with hook to next)
- **Typical episode beats**:
  - Where series arc appears
  - Where character development happens
  - How world-building integrates
  - Pacing rhythm

**Step 9: Cliffhanger Strategy**
- **Episode endings**:
  - Resolution + tease
  - Cliffhanger
  - Revelation
  - Question raised
- **Types of hooks**:
  - Plot twist
  - Character revelation
  - New threat
  - Mystery deepens
  - Relationship shift

**Step 10: Standalone vs. Serialized Balance**
- **A-Plot**: Episode story (resolves this episode)
- **B-Plot**: Mid-arc story (resolves in 3-5 episodes)
- **C-Plot**: Season/series arc (long-term)
- Balance ensures:
  - New readers can jump in
  - Regular readers get ongoing rewards
  - Series advances without confusing newcomers

**Deliverables**:
- `episode-template.md` (repeatable structure)
- `hook-strategy.md` (cliffhanger approaches)

### Phase 4: SEASON/ARC PLANNING
**Goal**: Plot specific season or multi-episode arc

**Tasks**:

  - Character focus
  - Key revelations
  - Cliffhanger/hook
  - Word count target

**Step 13: Subplot Weaving**
- **Character arcs**: Distribute development across episodes
- **Relationship arcs**: Track changes over time

- **Pacing**: Ensure variety (action, reflection, revelation)

**Step 14: Get Author Approval**
- Review complete season plan
- Ensure arc satisfies
- Check pacing across episodes
- Verify each episode works standalone AND advances series
