## Blog Post Workflow

### Phase 1: SETUP
**Goal**: Define the post at a high level so every decision serves a clear purpose

**Tasks**:
1. **Capture metadata**:
   - Working title
   - Project folder: `_drafts/[post-slug]/`
   - Target publication: (Substack / personal site / other)
   - Target date/deadline
   - Category/series (if applicable)

2. **Define audience**:
   - Who is this for? (experience level, interests, context)
   - What do they already know?
   - What do they struggle with?
   - What language/jargon do they use?

3. **Define purpose**:
   - What changes for the reader after reading?
   - Is this to: teach / persuade / reflect / entertain / document?
   - What's the one thing they should remember?

4. **Define scope**:
   - Quick hit (500-800 words)
   - Standard post (1,000-1,500 words)
   - Deep dive (2,000-3,000 words)
   - One core idea only; defer tangents to future posts

**Deliverables**:
- `brief.md` (audience, purpose, scope)

**Status Check**: ✅ Complete when post is defined

---

### Phase 2: CONCEPT & ANGLE
**Goal**: Turn a topic into a strong, focused angle and promise

**Tasks**:
1. **Brain-dump possible angles** (10-15 options):
   - "Why X matters for [audience]"
   - "How I solved [problem] with [approach]"
   - "Stop doing X, do Y instead"
   - "What [experience] taught me about [idea]"
   - "The [number] mistakes people make with [topic]"
   - "A better way to think about [concept]"

2. **Choose one primary angle**:
   - Fill in: "This post will help [audience] go from [current state] to [desired state] by [approach]"
   - Test: Does this angle differentiate from similar posts?
   - Test: Does this serve your audience's actual needs?

3. **Draft 3-5 working titles** using different patterns:
   - How-to: "How to [achieve result] without [common pain]"
   - Story: "What [experience] taught me about [idea]"
   - Opinion: "Why [common belief] is wrong about [topic]"
   - List: "The [X] [things] that [achieve result]"
   - Question: "Why do [people] struggle with [problem]?"

4. **Choose one working title** and one backup
   - Working title can change, but need starting point
   - Test: Would you click this title?

**Deliverables**:
- `concept.md` (angle statement, title options)

**Status Check**: ✅ Complete when angle is clear

---

### Phase 3: OUTLINE & RESEARCH
**Goal**: Build a clear skeleton before drafting prose

**Tasks**:
1. **Choose a structure pattern**:
   
   **How-to format**:
   - Problem → Why it matters → Step-by-step → Pitfalls → Next steps
   
   **Opinion format**:
   - Context → Thesis → 2-4 arguments → Counterpoint → Conclusion
   
   **Personal essay format**:
   - Setup → Turning point → Reflection → Takeaway
   
   **List format**:
   - Setup → List items (each with mini-story or example) → Wrap-up
   
   **Case study format**:
   - Challenge → Approach → Results → Lessons → Application

2. **Create section headings**:
   - 4-7 major sections (H2s)
   - Optional H3s for steps or sub-arguments
   - Each heading should be clear and functional
   - Avoid clever headings that obscure meaning

3. **Write 1-2 sentence summaries per section**:
   - What this section accomplishes
   - Key point or takeaway
   - How it connects to next section

4. **Identify research/reference needs**:
   - Statistics to include
   - Examples to describe
   - Sources to cite
   - Screenshots or diagrams needed

5. **Gather supporting material**:
   - Collect links, quotes, data
   - Write down examples while fresh
   - Note personal stories to include
   - Capture relevant details

6. **Outline opening and closing**:
   - **Opening hook** (first 2-3 sentences):
     - Story opening
     - Surprising fact
     - Common misconception
     - Provocative question
   - **Closing** (final paragraph):
     - Summarize key point
     - Call to action
     - Forward pointer
     - Open question for readers

**Deliverables**:
- `outline.md` (structure, section summaries, opening/closing)
- `research-notes.md` (sources, examples, data)

**Status Check**: ✅ Complete when outline feels solid

---

### Phase 4: BETA REVIEW (Optional)
**Goal**: Test outline with simulated readers before drafting

**Tasks**:
1. **Run beta review on outline**:
   - Use BETA-REVIEW-BOOTSTRAP
   - Check: Does structure make sense?
   - Check: Is scope appropriate?
   - Check: Are transitions clear?

2. **Adjust outline based on feedback**:
   - Reorder sections if needed
   - Clarify weak connections
   - Add missing pieces
   - Cut unnecessary tangents

**Deliverables**:
- `beta-review.md` (if running review)
- Updated outline

**Status Check**: ✅ Complete when outline validated (or skipped)

---

### Phase 5: DRAFTING
**Goal**: Convert outline to prose, maintain momentum

**Tasks**:
1. **Set drafting constraints**:
   - Time limit (e.g., 90 minutes max)
   - Environment (music, location, tools)
   - Goal: Complete first pass, not perfect prose

2. **Draft section by section**:
   - Follow outline structure
   - Write opening last (if that's easier)
   - Use placeholders for details: [STAT], [EXAMPLE], [LINK]
   - Keep momentum, don't stop to research
   - Mark unclear areas with [NOTE: needs work]

3. **Drafting principles**:
   - Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
   - One idea per paragraph
   - Active voice
   - Concrete examples
   - Conversational tone
   - Vary sentence length

4. **Don't self-edit while drafting**:
   - Get ideas down
   - Fix in revision
   - Trust the outline

5. **Track progress**:
   - Current word count
   - Sections completed
   - Placeholders to fill

**Deliverables**:
- `draft.md` (complete first draft)
- `drafting-notes.md` (placeholders, questions, ideas)

**Status Check**: ✅ Complete when full draft exists

---

### Phase 6: REVISION
**Goal**: Refine draft into publishable post

**Tasks**:
1. **Structural revision**:
   - Read through completely
   - Check flow between sections
   - Verify opening hooks
   - Ensure conclusion satisfies
   - Reorder if needed
   - Cut tangents
   - Add missing transitions

2. **Content revision**:
   - Fill placeholders
   - Add missing examples
   - Verify facts and links
   - Strengthen weak arguments
   - Clarify confusing sections
   - Add necessary context

3. **Voice revision**:
   - Consistent tone throughout
   - Remove awkward phrasing
   - Strengthen weak verbs
   - Cut unnecessary words
   - Vary sentence structure
   - Check for your voice (not generic)

4. **Technical revision**:
   - Grammar and punctuation
   - Spelling
   - Link formatting
   - Image placement (if any)
   - Formatting consistency

5. **Final read-through**:
   - Read aloud (catches awkward phrasing)
   - Check: Does this deliver on the title promise?
   - Check: Would you want to read this?
   - Check: Is there a clear takeaway?

**Deliverables**:
- `revised-draft.md` (polished version)
- `revision-notes.md` (changes made)

**Status Check**: ✅ Complete when post is publication-ready

---

### Phase 7: PUBLICATION
**Goal**: Format, publish, and archive

**Tasks**:
1. **Final title check**:
   - Review working title
   - Test alternatives
   - Choose final title
   - Write SEO-friendly slug

2. **Metadata and formatting**:
   - Add publication date
   - Set categories/tags
   - Write meta description (if applicable)
   - Format for target platform

   - [ ] All links work
   - [ ] Images display correctly
   - [ ] Formatting consistent
   - [ ] Read-through complete
   - [ ] Title finalized
   - [ ] Metadata complete

4. **Publish**:

   - Check formatting on live site

5. **Archive project**:
   - Save published version to `_posts/`
   - Archive drafts and notes
   - Update project index
   - Note what worked/didn't for next time
