# Scene Workflow

**Purpose**: Atomic scene brief creation and drafting protocol for systematic prose development

**Use with**: DRAFTING, EXPANSION, NOVEL, and REVISION bootstraps

---

## When to Use Scene Briefs

### Scope-Based Decision

**Flash Fiction (< 1,000 words)**:
- Scene briefs **optional**
- Flash typically functions as single atomic unit
- If used, treat entire flash as one Scene or Sequel

**Short Stories & Longer (1,000+ words)**:
- Scene briefs **recommended**
- Enables structural integrity
- Supports continuity across multiple scenes
- Facilitates human/AI collaboration per scene

**Novels (50,000+ words)**:
- Scene briefs **required**
- Essential for managing complexity
- Chapter-by-chapter scene structure
- Prevents structural drift

---

## Scene vs. Sequel Framework

Based on Randy Ingermanson's atomic scene structure from "How to Write the Perfect Scene."

### Scene (Proactive)

The **Scene** is where characters pursue goals and face setbacks.

**Three Components**:

1. **Goal**
   - What does the POV character want in THIS scene?
   - Must be specific, concrete, achievable in scene timeframe
   - Reader should know the goal early in the scene
   - Examples: "Get the key from the guard" not "Be happy"

2. **Conflict**
   - What prevents the character from achieving the goal?
   - Opposition, obstacles, antagonistic forces
   - Rising tension as character struggles
   - No easy resolution

3. **Disaster**
   - How does it go wrong?
   - Goal fails or succeeds with terrible consequences
   - Setback that creates new problem
   - Propels story forward
   - Types: "No!", "Yes, but...", "No, and furthermore..."

**Result**: Character faces setback → needs to process → leads to Sequel

---

### Sequel (Reactive)

The **Sequel** is where characters process disasters and make decisions.

**Three Components**:

1. **Reaction**
   - Immediate emotional response to disaster
   - Visceral, authentic to character
   - Processing the setback
   - Can be brief or extended depending on disaster severity

2. **Dilemma**
   - Character analyzes options
   - All options are bad or difficult
   - Internal conflict as character weighs choices
   - No obvious right answer
   - Increases tension even in "downtime"

3. **Decision**
   - Character commits to new course of action
   - Creates new Goal for next Scene
   - May be reluctant, forced, or determined
   - Propels story forward

**Result**: Character commits to new goal → leads to next Scene

---

## The Scene Chain

Effective stories alternate Scene and Sequel in a continuous chain:

```
Scene (Goal-Conflict-Disaster) 
  ↓
Sequel (Reaction-Dilemma-Decision)
  ↓
Scene (Goal-Conflict-Disaster)
  ↓
Sequel (Reaction-Dilemma-Decision)
  ↓
[continues to climax]
```

### Chain Integrity Rules

1. **Disaster leads to Reaction**: Every Scene disaster must be addressed in a Sequel reaction
2. **Decision leads to Goal**: Every Sequel decision must create the Goal for the next Scene
3. **No skipped links**: Don't jump from Disaster to new Goal without processing (unless intentional time jump)
4. **Sequel can be brief**: Not every Sequel needs full page count—some decisions are quick
5. **Scene can be internal**: Not all Scenes are action—can be emotional or intellectual goals

### When to Compress or Skip Sequels

- **Fast pacing**: Very brief Sequel (paragraph reaction + decision)
- **Clear decision**: If choice is obvious to character, compress Dilemma
- **Time jump**: Skip to next Scene if Sequel would be boring logistics
- **Ensemble cast**: Different POV characters process disasters differently

## Scene Brief Template

Use this template for every scene in your story.

```markdown
## Scene [Number]: [Brief Title/Summary]

**Type**: Scene / Sequel

**POV Character**: [Character Name]

**Setting**: [Location, time of day, atmosphere]

**Word Count Target**: [Estimated words for this scene]

---

### Structure

#### If Scene (Goal-Conflict-Disaster):

**Goal**: What does the POV character want to accomplish in this scene?
[Specific, concrete, achievable within scene scope]

**Conflict**: What prevents them from achieving this goal?
[Opposition, obstacles, antagonistic forces]

**Disaster**: How does it go wrong? What setback occurs?
[Goal failure or success with terrible cost—must propel story forward]

#### If Sequel (Reaction-Dilemma-Decision):

**Reaction**: How does the POV character emotionally respond to the previous disaster?
[Visceral, authentic processing of setback]

**Dilemma**: What bad or difficult options does the character face?
[Multiple paths, none ideal—internal conflict]

**Decision**: What does the character commit to doing?
[Creates the Goal for the next Scene]

---

**Connects To**:
- Previous: [Scene/Sequel number and how it connects]
- Next: [Scene/Sequel number and how this leads there]

**Key Story Elements**:
- Character Development: [What we learn or how character changes]
- Plot Advancement: [How this moves main plot forward]
- Subplots: [Any subplot threads touched]
- Thematic Elements: [Theme reinforcement or exploration]

---

**Drafting Approach**: [ ] Human First Draft  [ ] AI First Draft  [ ] TBD

**Status**: [ ] Brief Only  [ ] Drafted  [ ] Reviewed  [ ] Revised  [ ] Final

**Notes**: [Special considerations, research needed, tonal notes, etc.]
```

## Creating a Complete Scene Brief List

### Process: Plan All Scenes Before Drafting Any Prose

**For New Stories (DRAFTING, NOVEL)**:

1. **Start with Structure**
   - Identify major beats/turning points
   - Know your beginning, middle, end
   - Understand character arcs

2. **Break Into Scenes**
   - Each major beat becomes one or more Scenes
   - Each Scene disaster needs processing → Sequel
   - Number sequentially from start

3. **Create All Briefs**
   - Fill out template for every scene
   - Maintain Scene/Sequel alternation (mostly)
   - Don't draft prose yet

4. **Validate Chain Integrity**
   - Check: Disaster → Reaction connections
   - Check: Decision → Goal connections
   - Adjust briefs as needed

5. **Make Authorship Decisions**
   - Review each brief
   - Decide: Human first draft or AI first draft?
   - Mark in each brief

**For Expansions (EXPANSION)**:

1. **Identify Original Scenes**
   - Mark existing content as "Scene X (preserved)"
   - Note which are Scenes vs. Sequels
   - Identify structural gaps

2. **Plan New Scenes**
   - Where does expansion happen?
   - New Scenes to deepen conflict?
   - New Sequels to add processing?
   - Fill gaps in scene chain

3. **Create Integrated Scene List**
   - Combine original + new scenes
   - Number sequentially
   - Create briefs only for NEW scenes
   - Mark originals as "preserved"

4. **Validate Chain Integrity**
   - Ensure new scenes connect properly
   - Check disaster/reaction flows
   - Adjust as needed

5. **Authorship Decisions for New Scenes**
   - Preserved scenes already exist
   - Decide approach for each new scene

---

## Scene Chain Validation

Before drafting any prose, validate the complete scene chain.

### Validation Checklist

**Structural Integrity**:
- [ ] Scenes and Sequels alternate (with intentional exceptions noted)
- [ ] Every Scene has Goal-Conflict-Disaster
- [ ] Every Sequel has Reaction-Dilemma-Decision
- [ ] Each Disaster connects to next Reaction
- [ ] Each Decision creates Goal for next Scene

**Story Progression**:
- [ ] Each scene advances plot or deepens character
- [ ] No redundant scenes (same goal attempted twice without change)
- [ ] Escalating tension (disasters worsen or complicate)
- [ ] Clear through-line from opening to climax

**Character Consistency**:
- [ ] POV clear for each scene
- [ ] Character goals align with motivations
- [ ] Decisions match character personality/arc
- [ ] Emotional reactions feel authentic

**Pacing**:
- [ ] Mix of scene lengths (avoid all same)
- [ ] Balance action (Scenes) and processing (Sequels)
- [ ] Sequel length appropriate to disaster severity
- [ ] Compressed Sequels where pacing demands it

**Connection Flow**:
- [ ] "Connects To" fields filled out for all scenes
- [ ] No orphaned scenes (disconnected from chain)
- [ ] Time/location transitions make sense
- [ ] Subplot threads tracked across scenes

---

## Scene Drafting Protocol

Once all scene briefs are validated, draft scenes one at a time.

### Per-Scene Workflow

**For Each Scene in Sequence**:

1. **Review Brief**
   - Re-read the scene brief
   - Confirm Goal/Conflict/Disaster or Reaction/Dilemma/Decision
   - Check connections to previous and next scenes
   - Note any special requirements

2. **Choose Execution Mode**

   **Option A: Human First Draft**
   - Author writes the scene prose
   - AI reviews for: structure integrity, pacing, voice consistency
   - AI suggests improvements (author decides)
   - Iterate until scene works

   **Option B: AI First Draft**
   - AI drafts scene prose from brief
   - Author reviews for: voice authenticity, character truth, emotional accuracy
   - Author edits/rewrites as needed
   - Iterate until scene works

   **Option C: Collaborative**
   - Real-time back-and-forth
   - Author writes openings/key moments
   - AI fills connective tissue
   - Joint refinement

3. **Draft the Scene**
   - Execute chosen approach
   - Focus on this scene only (don't jump ahead)
   - Hit the brief's structural beats
   - Target word count is guideline, not rule

4. **Scene-Level Review**

   **Structure Check**:
   - [ ] Does scene fulfill the brief?
   - [ ] Goal/Conflict/Disaster clear? (if Scene)
   - [ ] Reaction/Dilemma/Decision clear? (if Sequel)
   - [ ] Connects properly to previous scene?
   - [ ] Sets up next scene?

   **Craft Check**:
   - [ ] Voice consistent with story/character
   - [ ] Pacing appropriate for scene type
   - [ ] Sensory details present
   - [ ] Dialogue natural (if applicable)
   - [ ] Show vs. tell balance

   **Continuity Check**:
   - [ ] Character knowledge consistent
   - [ ] Setting details match previous scenes
   - [ ] Timeline coherent
   - [ ] Subplot elements tracked

5. **Update Status**
   - Mark scene as "Drafted" in tracker
   - Note authorship approach used
   - Flag any issues for later revision
   - Commit to GitHub

6. **Proceed to Next Scene**
   - Don't revise whole story yet
   - Move to next scene in sequence
   - Trust the brief chain

## Scene Tracker Template

Track all scenes in a single project document: `scene-tracker.md`

```markdown
# Scene Tracker: [Project Name]

**Status Legend**:
- **Brief**: Scene brief created, not yet drafted
- **Drafted**: First draft complete
- **Reviewed**: Scene-level review done
- **Revised**: Changes implemented
- **Final**: Ready for story assembly

**Authorship**:
- **H**: Human first draft
- **A**: AI first draft
- **C**: Collaborative
- **P**: Preserved (expansion projects)

---

| # | Type | Title | Goal/Decision Summary | Status | Auth | Words | Issues/Notes |
|---|------|-------|----------------------|--------|------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Scene | Opening | Get map from stranger | Final | H | 850 | - |
| 2 | Sequel | Doubt | Decide to trust map | Drafted | A | 400 | Needs emotion depth |
| 3 | Scene | Into forest | Reach river by sunset | Brief | TBD | ~1000 | Research: forest types |
| 4 | Sequel | Lost | Choose to cross river | Brief | H | ~600 | - |
| 5 | Scene | Crossing | Ford the river | Brief | A | ~800 | Action scene |

**Total Word Count**: [Running total]

**Notes**:
- Scenes 1-2 drafted and reviewed
- Scene 3 needs forest research before drafting
- Planning 15 total scenes for ~10,000 word story
```

## Scene Workflow in Action

### Example: Expanding Flash to Short Story

**Original Flash**: 500 words, single scene
**Target**: 4,000 words, multiple scenes

**Step 1: Identify Original Structure**
```markdown
## Scene 1 (Preserved): Confrontation
**Type**: Scene
**Goal**: Character confronts antagonist
**Disaster**: Antagonist reveals character's secret
**Status**: Preserved
**Words**: 500
```

**Step 2: Plan Expansion Scenes**
```markdown
## Scene 2 (New): Preparation
**Type**: Sequel
**Reaction**: Process what secret reveal means
**Decision**: Decide to gather allies
**Status**: Brief
**Drafting Approach**: AI First Draft

## Scene 3 (New): Gathering Allies
**Type**: Scene  
**Goal**: Convince friend to help
**Disaster**: Friend refuses, reveals own secret
**Status**: Brief
**Drafting Approach**: Human First Draft

[Continue planning all scenes...]
```

**Step 3: Validate Chain**
- Scene 1 disaster → Scene 2 reaction ✓
- Scene 2 decision → Scene 3 goal ✓
- Continue checking...

**Step 4: Draft New Scenes**
- Keep Scene 1 as anchor
- Draft Scene 2 (AI first)
- Draft Scene 3 (Human first)
- Continue in sequence...

**Step 5: Assemble**
- Original + new scenes integrated
- Full continuity review
- Polish and finalize

## FAQ

### Q: Do I really need to plan ALL scenes before drafting ANY prose?
**A**: For stories over 1,000 words, yes. Benefits:
- See the complete story structure before committing
- Catch plot holes and pacing issues early
- Adjust briefs much faster than rewriting prose
- Clear roadmap prevents mid-draft wandering
- Efficient continuity management

### Q: Can I change scene briefs after I start drafting?
**A**: Yes! Briefs are guides, not contracts. If a better idea emerges:
- Update the brief
- Check how it affects downstream scenes
- Adjust connected scenes' briefs if needed
- Continue drafting with new plan

### Q: What if a scene becomes two scenes during drafting?
**A**: Split it:
1. Create new scene brief for the split portion
2. Update scene numbers for subsequent scenes
3. Update scene tracker
4. Validate connections still work
5. Continue

### Q: Should Sequels always be shorter than Scenes?
**A**: Not always. Sequels CAN be brief (single paragraph), but complex emotional processing or difficult dilemmas may need full scene length. Match length to story needs.

### Q: Can I have two Scenes in a row without a Sequel?
**A**: Yes, if intentional:
- Fast-paced action where processing happens later
- Character already committed to plan (executing multiple goals)
- Montage or time compression
- Just note the exception and ensure you eventually process accumulated disasters

### Q: What about scenes with multiple POV characters?
**A**: Each POV shift is a new scene:
- Scene 5: Alice's Scene (her goal)
- Scene 6: Bob's Scene (his goal)
- Scene 7: Alice's Sequel (her reaction to her disaster)
- Or: Use omniscient POV and treat as single scene with multiple character goals

### Q: How detailed should scene briefs be?
**A**: Detailed enough to draft from, but not prose:
- Goal should be one clear sentence
- Conflict described in 2-3 sentences
- Disaster stated clearly
- Don't write dialogue or specific actions yet
- Capture the essence, not the execution

### Q: Can I use scene briefs for revision?
**A**: Absolutely:
1. Break existing draft into current scene structure
2. Analyze which scenes work/don't work
3. Create briefs for problem scenes (what they SHOULD do)
4. Redraft those scenes from briefs
5. Integrate revised scenes with working scenes
