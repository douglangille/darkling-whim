# ASSESSMENT Bootstrap

**Purpose**: Analyze existing published work to determine the optimal path forward - polish at current scope or expand to larger form.

**Use this for**:
- Published flash fiction (under 1,000 words)
- Published short stories
- Work you want to revisit and improve
- Stories that might benefit from expansion

---

## When to Use This Bootstrap

Use ASSESSMENT when you have already-published work and want to determine:
1. Whether it should stay at its current scope (proceed to REVISION)
2. Whether it would benefit from expansion to a larger form (proceed to EXPANSION)
3. What the story's core strengths and weaknesses are
4. What specific improvements would have the most impact

Do NOT use for unpublished drafts - those should use REVISION or DRAFTING bootstraps directly.

## Assessment Workflow

### Phase 1: INITIAL ANALYSIS
**Goal**: Deep read and core identification

**Tasks**:
1. **Read the published story multiple times**:
   - First read: Pure reader experience, note immediate reactions
   - Second read: Analytical lens, identify story beats
   - Third read: Technical lens, examine craft elements

2. **Document core elements**:
   - Premise: What is this story about in one sentence?
   - Promise: What did the title/opening promise the reader?
   - Payoff: Did the ending deliver on that promise?
   - Heart: What is the emotional core?
   - Theme: What larger idea does this explore?

3. **Capture immediate observations**:
   - What works exceptionally well?
   - What feels underdeveloped?
   - What surprised you on re-reading?
   - What would you change if starting fresh?

**Deliverables**:
- `assessment.md` with Initial Analysis section

**Status Check**: ✅ Complete when you can articulate the story's core in one sentence

---

### Phase 2: SCOPE ANALYSIS
**Goal**: Determine if current scope serves the story

**Tasks**:
1. **Evaluate current scope**:
   - Word count: [actual]
   - Classification: [flash / short story / novelette]
   - Pacing: Too rushed? Too slow? Just right?
   - Scene count: How many distinct scenes?
   - Time span: How much story time passes?

2. **Identify expansion candidates**:
   - Scenes that are told instead of shown
   - Characters mentioned but not developed
   - World details implied but not explored
   - Emotional beats that feel compressed
   - Plot points that happen off-page
   - Backstory referenced but not revealed

3. **Test the boundaries**:
   - If this were 2x longer, what would you add?
   - If this were 4x longer, what would change?
   - What scenes would you love to write but couldn't fit?
   - What character moments got cut for space?

4. **Scope recommendation**:
   - **POLISH**: Story works at current scope, refine it
   - **EXPAND**: Story is cramped, needs room to breathe
   - **REBOOT**: Core is good but execution needs complete rebuild

**Deliverables**:
- `assessment.md` with Scope Analysis section

**Status Check**: ✅ Complete when you have a clear recommendation with supporting evidence

---

### Phase 3: PATH RECOMMENDATION
**Goal**: Determine next steps and create actionable plan

**Tasks**:
1. **If recommending POLISH (REVISION path)**:
   - List 3-5 specific improvements needed
   - Prioritize by impact (high/medium/low)
   - Estimate scope of changes (line edits vs structural)
   - Note any constraints (published version, word count limits)

2. **If recommending EXPAND (EXPANSION path)**:
   - Identify target scope (short story / novelette / novella)
   - List scenes/moments to add
   - Specify what to preserve unchanged (the "core")
   - Describe how expansion serves the story
   - Rough outline of expanded structure

3. **If recommending REBOOT**:
   - Identify what to salvage (premise, characters, moments)
   - Describe why full rewrite serves the story better
   - Consider if this should be a new story instead
   - Outline approach for rebuild

4. **Create action plan**:
   - Which bootstrap to use next (REVISION or EXPANSION)
   - Specific focus areas
   - Estimated sessions needed
   - Any research or prep work required

**Deliverables**:
- `assessment.md` with Path Recommendation section
- Recommendation for next bootstrap

**Status Check**: ✅ Complete when you have clear next steps and confidence in the path

## Scope Analysis

**Current Scope**: [X words, Y scenes, Z timespan]

**Pacing Assessment**: [Too rushed / Too slow / Appropriate]

### Expansion Candidates

1. **[Element 1]**: [Why this could be expanded]
2. **[Element 2]**: [Why this could be expanded]
3. **[Element 3]**: [Why this could be expanded]

### Boundary Testing

**If 2x longer**: [What would you add?]

**If 4x longer**: [What would fundamentally change?]

**Scenes I wish I'd written**: [List them]

**Character moments that got cut**: [List them]

## Tips for Accurate Assessment

1. **Wait before assessing**: Let some time pass after publication. Fresh eyes see more clearly.

2. **Trust your gut**: If something feels off on re-reading, it probably is.

3. **Separate "fix" from "expand"**: Polish improves what's there. Expansion adds what's missing. Different paths.

4. **Consider the original intent**: What were you trying to accomplish? Did you succeed?

5. **Read as a stranger**: Pretend you didn't write this. What would you think?

6. **Don't force expansion**: Some stories are perfect at flash length. Expansion isn't always better.

7. **Be specific**: "Character needs work" is vague. "Sarah's motivation unclear in Act 2" is actionable.

## What Can Go Wrong

**Problem**: Assessment reveals story is fundamentally broken
**Solution**: Consider REBOOT path or write a new story with similar themes

**Problem**: Can't decide between polish and expand
**Solution**: Do both - complete REVISION first, then assess again for expansion

**Problem**: Assessment takes multiple sessions
**Solution**: Normal! Don't rush. Commit after each phase.

**Problem**: Original is published, worried about changing it
**Solution**: Revised version becomes separate work. Original stays published. You're creating v2.0.
