# BLOG-POST Bootstrap

**Purpose**: Plan, draft, revise, and publish a non-fiction blog post with a repeatable, low-friction workflow.

Use this when writing:
- Weekly Substack essays
- How‑to/tutorial posts
- Opinion/analysis pieces
- Process write‑ups and case studies

---

## Phase 0 – Setup

**Goal**: Define the post at a high level so every later decision serves a clear purpose.

**Tasks**:
1. Capture metadata:
   - Working title:
   - Project folder: `_drafts/[post-slug]/`
   - Target publication: (Substack / site / other)
   - Deadline:
2. Define **Audience**:
   - Who is this for? (experience level, interests, context)
   - What do they already know?
   - What do they struggle with?
3. Define **Purpose**:
   - What changes for the reader after reading?
   - Is this: teach / persuade / reflect / entertain / document?
4. Define **Scope**:
   - Quick hit (500–800 words) or Deep dive (1500–3000 words)?
   - One core idea only; defer tangents to future posts.

**Deliverable**:
- `brief.md` – short one-page definition of audience, purpose, scope.

## Phase 1 – Concept & Angle

**Goal**: Turn a topic into a strong, focused angle and promise.

**Tasks**:
1. Brain-dump 10–15 possible angles:
   - “Why X matters for [audience]”
   - “How I solved [problem] with [approach]”
   - “Stop doing X, do Y instead”
2. Choose **one** primary angle:
   - Fill in: “This post will help [audience] go from [current state] to [desired state] by [approach].”
3. Draft 3–5 working titles using different patterns:
   - How‑to: “How to [achieve result] without [common pain]”
   - Story: “What [experience] taught me about [idea]”
   - Opinion: “Why [common belief] is wrong about [topic]”
4. Choose **one working title** and one **backup**.

**Deliverables**:
- `concept.md` – angle statement + title options.

## Phase 2 – Outline & Research

**Goal**: Build a clear skeleton before drafting prose. [web:113][web:102]

**Tasks**:
1. Choose a **structure pattern**:
   - How‑to: Problem → Why it matters → Step‑by‑step → Pitfalls → Next steps
   - Opinion: Context → Thesis → 2–4 arguments → Counterpoint → Conclusion
   - Personal essay: Setup → Turning point → Reflection → Takeaway
   - List: Setup → List items (each with mini‑story or example) → Wrap‑up
2. Create section headings:
   - 4–7 major sections (H2s)
   - Optional H3s for steps or sub‑arguments
