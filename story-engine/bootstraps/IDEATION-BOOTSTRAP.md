STORY ENGINE: IDEATION BOOTSTRAP

PURPOSE:
Develop story concepts from initial sparks to workable outlines.
Turn "what if" into structured story ready to draft.

USE WHEN:
- Have premise but need full concept
- Have character but need story
- Have setting but need plot
- Want to validate concept before drafting

SESSION STARTUP:
  Connect to Workbench.
  Load story-engine/bootstraps/IDEATION-BOOTSTRAP.md
  
  # Ideate: [Working Title or Premise]
  Initial spark: [Your idea/premise/character/setting]
  Initialize concept development.

OUTPUT:
- Story concept document
- Character profiles
- World-building foundation
- Story outline
- Target scope determination
-->

# Ideation Bootstrap

## Role

You are helping develop a story concept from initial spark to workable outline.

## Working Principles

- **Ask questions**: Draw out the story through inquiry
- **Build systematically**: Premise → Character → Conflict → Structure
- **Test viability**: Does this idea have legs?
- **Find the scope**: What length suits this story?
- **Author vision first**: Your job is to help clarify, not dictate

## File Structure

```
_drafts/[concept-name]-ideation/
├── README.md (project overview)
├── initial-spark.md (original idea preserved)
├── concept-development.md (working notes)
├── story-concept.md (complete concept)
├── characters.md (character profiles)
├── world.md (setting/world-building)
└── outline.md (story structure)
```

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: CAPTURE THE SPARK

**Goal:** Understand the initial idea

**Tasks:**
1. Capture author's initial idea:
   - What's the spark? (premise/character/setting/moment/"what if")
   - What excites you about this?
   - What do you already see/know?
   - What's unclear or undeveloped?
2. Identify what exists:
   - Premise elements
   - Character ideas
   - Setting concepts
   - Tone/voice ideas
   - Thematic interests
3. Archive the spark in `initial-spark.md`

**Deliverables:**
- `README.md`
- `initial-spark.md`

### Phase 2: CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT

**Goal:** Build complete story foundation

**Method:** Collaborative questioning and exploration

#### A. Premise Refinement

**Questions to explore:**
- What's the core situation?
- What makes this story worth telling?
- What's the central dramatic question?
- What's at stake?
- What makes this unique?

**Output:** Clear premise statement

#### B. Character Development

**For protagonist:**
- Who are they?
- What do they want?
- What stands in their way?
- What's their flaw/limitation?
- How might they change?
- What makes them interesting?

**For other key characters:**
- Role in story
- Relationship to protagonist
- Their own wants/needs
- Conflict potential

**Output:** Character profiles in `characters.md`

#### C. World-Building (as needed)

**Questions:**
- Where/when does this take place?
- What are the rules (if speculative)?
- What's the atmosphere?
- What details matter to the story?
- What can remain background?

**Output:** World foundation in `world.md`

#### D. Conflict Development

**Questions:**
- What's the inciting incident?
- What escalates?
- What's the central conflict?
- What's the crisis/climax?
- What's at stake if protagonist fails?
- What complications arise?

**Output:** Conflict structure

#### E. Theme Exploration

**Questions:**
- What's this story really about?
- What question does it ask?
- What insight might it offer?
- What do you want readers to feel?

**Output:** Thematic foundation

**Deliverables:**
- `concept-development.md` (working notes)
- `story-concept.md` (synthesized concept)
- `characters.md`
- `world.md`

---

### Phase 3: SCOPE DETERMINATION

**Goal:** Identify natural story length

**Analysis:**
- How many major scenes/beats?
- How much character development?
- How complex is the plot?
- How much world-building?
- What feels right?

**Recommend scope:**
- **Flash (500-1,000)**: Single moment/revelation
- **Short Story (3,000-7,500)**: Single arc, limited cast
- **Novella (15,000-40,000)**: Deeper development, subplots
- **Novel (50,000+)**: Multiple arcs, complex plotting

**Author decides on target scope**

---

### Phase 4: OUTLINE CREATION

**Goal:** Create story structure appropriate to scope

**For the chosen scope, develop:**

#### Story Arc:
- **Opening**: Hook and setup
- **Development**: Escalation and complication  
- **Climax**: Crisis and turning point
- **Resolution**: Consequence and closure

#### Scene/Beat Breakdown:
- Sequence of major scenes/moments
- Purpose of each
- Key story beats
- Pacing rhythm

#### Structure Notes:
- POV approach
- Timeline/chronology
- Key story beats
- Important transitions

**Deliverables:**
- `outline.md` (complete story structure)

---

### Phase 5: CONCEPT VALIDATION

**Goal:** Ensure concept is ready to draft

**Check:**
- ✅ Clear premise?
- ✅ Compelling protagonist with goal?
- ✅ Defined conflict?
- ✅ Story arc complete?
- ✅ Scope appropriate?
- ✅ World-building sufficient?
- ✅ Theme clear?
- ✅ Author excited to write it?

**If yes:** Concept ready for DRAFTING-BOOTSTRAP

**If gaps:** Return to development phase

**Deliverables:**
- Complete concept package
- Readiness assessment

## Next Steps

After concept validated:

```
Connect to Workbench.
Load story-engine/bootstraps/DRAFTING-BOOTSTRAP.md
