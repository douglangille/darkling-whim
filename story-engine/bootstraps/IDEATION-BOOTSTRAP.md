# IDEATION Bootstrap

**Purpose**: Develop story concept from seed idea, prompt, or inspiration into structured story premise ready for drafting.

---

## When to Use This Bootstrap

- Have a seed idea but not sure if it's a story
- Prompted by concept ("what if...?")
- Sparked by image, news item, or experience
- Need to validate if idea has legs
- Want to explore before committing to draft

---

## Ideation Workflow

### Phase 1: PREMISE DEVELOPMENT
**Goal**: Turn seed into story premise

**Tasks**:
1. Capture the seed:
   - What sparked this?
   - What's interesting about it?
   - Why do you want to write this?
2. Ask core questions:
   - **Who**: Whose story is this?
   - **What**: What happens?
   - **Where**: What's the setting?
   - **When**: What's the timeframe?
   - **Why**: What's at stake?
   - **How**: What makes this unique?
3. Develop premise statement:
   - Format: "[Protagonist] must [goal] or else [stakes] in a world where [unique element]"
   - One sentence that captures the story
4. Test premise:
   - Does it suggest conflict?
   - Is there character potential?
   - Does it interest you?
   - Could you sustain it for target length?
5. Save premise document

**Deliverables**:
- `premise.md` (seed idea → premise statement)

**Status Check**: ✅ Complete when premise is clear

---

### Phase 2: CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT
**Goal**: Create protagonist (and key characters)

**Tasks**:
1. Protagonist basics:
   - **Name**: [Who are they?]
   - **Role**: [What do they do?]
   - **Defining trait**: [What makes them distinct?]
2. Want vs. Need:
   - **External Want**: [What do they think they want?]
   - **Internal Need**: [What do they actually need to grow?]
   - **Flaw**: [What holds them back?]
3. Why this protagonist for this story:
   - Why are they uniquely positioned for this conflict?
   - What about them makes the story interesting?
4. Supporting characters:
   - **Ally**: [Who helps?]
   - **Antagonist**: [Who opposes?]
   - **Others**: [Who else matters?]
5. Character voice:
   - How does this protagonist see the world?
   - What's their voice like?
6. Save character notes

**Deliverables**:
- `characters.md` (character sketches)

**Status Check**: ✅ Complete when protagonist is vivid

---

### Phase 3: CONFLICT DEVELOPMENT
**Goal**: Define central conflict and stakes

**Tasks**:
1. External conflict:
   - What's the plot-level problem?
   - Who/what opposes protagonist?
   - What obstacles exist?
2. Internal conflict:
   - What's the character-level struggle?
   - What must protagonist overcome in themselves?
   - How does external conflict trigger internal?
3. Stakes:
   - **If protagonist succeeds**: [What's gained?]
   - **If protagonist fails**: [What's lost?]
   - Why should readers care?
4. Conflict escalation:
   - How does tension build?
   - What makes things worse?
   - What's the point of no return?
5. Save conflict document

**Deliverables**:
- `conflict.md` (external/internal conflict and stakes)

**Status Check**: ✅ Complete when conflict is compelling

---

### Phase 4: STRUCTURE EXPLORATION
**Goal**: Find story's natural shape

**Tasks**:
1. Identify story type:
   - Character arc story?
   - Plot-driven?
   - Concept exploration?
   - Mood piece?
2. Sketch beginning:
   - Where does story start?
   - What's the hook?
   - What's the inciting incident?
3. Sketch middle:
   - How does conflict escalate?
   - What's the midpoint?
   - What's the crisis?
4. Sketch ending:
   - How does conflict resolve?
   - What changes?
   - What's the emotional note?
5. Determine scope:
   - Flash fiction (under 1,000)
   - Short story (2,000-7,500)
   - Novelette (7,500-17,500)
   - Novella (17,500-40,000)
   - Novel (50,000+)
6. Save structure notes

**Deliverables**:
- `structure.md` (story shape and scope)

**Status Check**: ✅ Complete when arc is clear

---

### Phase 5: VALIDATION
**Goal**: Decide if this story is ready to draft

**Tasks**:
1. Review all concept documents:
   - Premise compelling?
   - Characters vivid?
   - Conflict strong?
   - Structure clear?
2. Test questions:
   - **Passion**: Do you want to write this?
   - **Clarity**: Do you know what happens?
   - **Confidence**: Can you sustain this for target length?
   - **Uniqueness**: Is this story worth telling?
3. Identify gaps:
   - What's still unclear?
   - What needs more development?
   - What concerns remain?
4. Make decision:
   - ✅ **Ready to draft**: Proceed to DRAFTING-BOOTSTRAP
   - 🔄 **Needs more work**: Specify what
   - ❌ **Not viable**: Document why and table it
5. Save concept package

**Deliverables**:
- `concept-package.md` (complete validated concept)
- Decision on next steps

**Status Check**: ✅ Complete when decision is made

## Working Principles

- **No judgment**: All ideas welcome
- **Explore freely**: Let ideas evolve
- **Question everything**: Test assumptions
- **Be specific**: Vague ideas stay vague
- **Trust instinct**: You know if it excites you
- **Be honest**: Some ideas aren't stories
- **Document evolution**: Capture how idea develops

## Prompts for Stuck Points

### If premise feels weak:
- What's the worst thing that could happen to this character?
- What if you added "but..." to the premise?
- Who is the last person who should face this situation?

### If character feels flat:
- What are they afraid of?
- What do they lie about?
- What would they never do (until this story)?

### If conflict feels weak:
- What if you made it personal?
- What if you raised the stakes?
- What if there's a ticking clock?

### If structure feels unclear:
- What's the before/after for protagonist?
- What's the one thing that must happen?
- What's the emotional journey?
