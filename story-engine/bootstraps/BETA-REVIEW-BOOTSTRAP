# BETA-REVIEW Bootstrap

**Purpose**: Run a single, focused “beta reader” pass on an outline or draft, simulate target audience feedback, and convert it into a surgical revision plan.

Use this for:
- Blog post outlines before drafting
- Fiction or essay drafts before heavy revision
- Sanity checks on structure and clarity (not line editing)

**Constraints**:
- **Single pass only** (avoid endless tweaking)
- Focus on **patterns and priorities**, not granular line edits

---

## Phase 0 – Setup & Intent

**Goal**: Clarify what you want from the beta review so feedback stays focused. [web:119][web:127]

**Tasks**:
1. Choose artifact:
   - Blog outline: `outline.md`
   - Draft: `draft.md` or `revised-draft.md`
   - Assembled fiction: `assembled-draft.md`
2. Define target audience:
   - Age range, typical knowledge level.
   - Genre or topic preferences.
   - What they value (clarity, craft, novelty, emotional hit, etc.).
3. Define **review questions**:
   - “What hits?” (what’s engaging, clear, and compelling?)
   - “What misses?” (confusing, boring, repetitive, off-tone?)
   - “What’s missing?” (gaps in logic, stakes, context, or payoff?)
4. Capture intent in `beta-brief.md`:
   - Why are you running this review now?
   - What you’re NOT asking for (e.g., no copy-edits, no style changes).

**Deliverables**:
- `beta-brief.md` – purpose, audience, constraints.

## Phase 1 – Audience Simulation

**Goal**: Simulate a small panel (5–7) of target readers with slightly different perspectives. [web:1][web:7][web:96]

**Tasks**:
1. Define 3–5 **reader personas**:
   - Example (blog):
     - “Practitioner Pat” – busy, skims for actionable steps.
     - “Curious Casey” – likes context, wants to understand the why.
     - “Skeptical Sam” – questions assumptions and edge cases.
   - Example (fiction):
     - “Core Fan” – loves the genre and tropes.
     - “Voice Lover” – cares most about style and character.
     - “Pacing Hawk” – sensitive to slow or confusing sections.
2. For each persona, have them “read” the artifact and answer:
   - Where did you lean in?
   - Where did attention drift?
   - What confused or annoyed you?
   - What would you tell a friend about this piece?
3. Capture persona responses in **notes** (you can keep this implicit, since you don’t actually want 7 separate reports in files).

**Output shape** (inside the session, not necessarily separate files):
- Bullet lists per persona, tagged by section or scene.

**Deliverables**:
- Implicit: Persona‑level feedback (rolled up next phase).

## Phase 2 – Feedback Synthesis

**Goal**: Collapse all persona reactions into a small set of clear patterns and priorities. [web:116][web:124]

**Tasks**:
1. Identify **converging patterns**:
   - Issues that 60–80% of personas noticed.
   - Strengths multiple personas praised.
2. Categorize into:
   - **HITS** – keep and maybe emphasize.
   - **MISSES** – need fix or cut.
   - **MAYBES** – optional improvements.
3. Organize by dimension:
   - Concept & promise (hook, premise).
   - Structure & pacing.
   - Clarity & coherence.
   - Character/voice or tone (for fiction/personal).
   - Emotional impact or usefulness.
4. Summarize in `beta-review.md` using consistent headings:

Example structure for `beta-review.md`:
