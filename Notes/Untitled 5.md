# Act II — Mirrors and Memory

# Chapter 4 — The Garden of Mirrors
## Part 1 — The Clearing

“The next mistake,” Larry said.

  

The words followed them around the bend and into light. The corridor loosened, hedges sighing apart until the Maze opened its mouth wider than before. Mitzy stepped through first, spear balanced against her shoulder, and the air changed—cooler, rinsed clean, full of a brittle shine that made her eyes ache.

  

Leaves tiled the clearing like scales, thousands of them, each one slick and bright enough to catch a face. Sun broke through in narrow blades and scattered across the ivy, turning the whole place into a bowl of green glass. When she moved, a hundred Mitzys moved with her, small and uncertain and armed.

  

“Don’t touch,” Larry said, settling to hover at her cheek. “It’s hungry for fingerprints.”

  

Mitzy swallowed. “They’re just leaves.”

  

“Everything’s ‘just’ something,” he murmured. “Until it isn’t.”

  

She edged forward. The earth underfoot felt tight and springy, like a drumhead. Her reflections came closer—eyes too wide, mouth too thin, a smear of dirt at her jaw she could not wipe off because it lived in the leaf, not on her skin. She raised the spear a little and every Mitzy lifted hers, a forest of points aimed at a girl in the middle.

  

“Stop that,” she told herself, and the copies froze mid-breath, as if waiting to find out who got to be the real one.

  

Larry drifted higher, his shadow hopping from leaf to leaf. “This is where the Maze checks your homework.”

  

“I didn’t bring any,” she said, but softly, because the clearing felt like a church that had forgotten what it worshipped.

  

The nearest leaves shivered. Faces blurred, sharpened. One Mitzy looked older—chin up, eyes cold. Another smaller—baby fat in the cheeks, a milk tooth missing. A third turned her head in a way Mitzy hadn’t moved yet and smiled a mean little smile she didn’t recognize as hers.

  

Mitzy’s hands went damp on the shaft of the spear. “Make it stop.”

  

“You make it,” Larry said. “It only shows what you bring.”

  

She shifted her weight. The drumhead ground gave a mild complaint, a low creak like a door thinking about opening. She glanced down. Between the ivy’s glossy panes, the dark soil winked—then closed again as the leaves overlapped, careful and neat, hiding whatever looked back from underneath.

  

“June?” Mitzy tried, just to see. Her voice broke into the shine and scattered. A small face flickered on a dozen leaves at once—round, quick, gone.

  

She took a breath that felt too sharp for her lungs. “I saw her.”

  

“Did you?” Larry asked. “Or did she see you?”

  

Mitzy didn’t answer. She stepped into the center of the clearing where the light was brightest, turned slowly, and watched the crowded girl she was, had been, might be, gather itself around her like a ring of witnesses. The spear’s tip nudged a leaf; her reflection’s point met it from the other side with a tiny, perfect kiss. The sound it made was not metal on glass but something wetter, nearer to bone.

  

“Don’t,” Larry said again, but less sure this time.

  

Mitzy kept turning until the reflections doubled and the doubleness made her dizzy. Somewhere in that spinning, one of the Mitzys tilted her head like a question and lagged a heartbeat out of time.

  

Mitzy stopped. So did they. The late one didn’t. She kept smiling that not-quite-her smile and lifted her spear a fraction higher than all the rest.


---

## Part 2 — Reflections Speak

The smiling one stepped closer—or maybe the others shrank away—until Mitzy stood eye to eye with herself through a film of trembling leaf-light. She could see every detail: the dirt in her hairline, the tremor in her lip, the tiny scab on her knee from the day she’d tripped over June’s doll carriage and blamed the doll for existing.

“Don’t,” Mitzy whispered, though she didn’t know to which of them she was speaking.

The reflection tilted its head the wrong way and opened its mouth. When it spoke, the sound came from everywhere at once—like someone whispering through the bones of the Maze.

“She always took first.”

Mitzy flinched. “No.”

“The swing. The window seat. The last piece of cake.”

“She’s smaller!” Mitzy shouted. “She needed—”

“You needed,” said the voice. “But you gave it away.”

Mitzy stepped back. Her heel crushed a leaf and the reflection beneath her boot broke apart in liquid color, reforming at her shoulder. There was no end to her—Mitzys rippling in concentric circles, speaking over one another until the words braided into something like chanting.

“You needed. You gave. You needed. You gave.”

Larry circled above her, wings stirring light. “You’re making noise again, Princess. The Maze will think you’re trying to start a choir.”

“Make it stop!”

“Can’t. That’s your face talking.”

The reflections multiplied. Older, younger, meaner, softer—each with its own version of her frown. A child barely six crossed her arms and hissed, “She broke your crayons.” A teenager she hadn’t yet become sneered, “And you let her.”

Mitzy clutched the spear tight enough for her knuckles to go white. “Stop it! She’s just my sister!”

The mirrored Mitzys paused. Then one—an age she didn’t recognize at all—leaned forward, the eyes too dark, the voice too low.

“Then why did you dream she’d never been born?”

Mitzy’s throat went cold. “That’s not—”

“True?” the reflection asked, almost kindly. “We’re you, remember?”

The air in the clearing thickened. Leaves trembled on their stems. Somewhere under her feet the earth gave a long, slow sigh, as if the Maze had been waiting for that answer all along.

Larry’s voice came small and dry: “Careful, Princess-Not. The mirrors don’t lie. But they do enjoy exaggerating.”

Mitzy tried to swallow, but her mouth had gone dry. “What happens if I break them?”

Larry fluttered higher, wings a blur. “Depends whether you like the sound of yourself screaming.”

Mitzy looked down at her own doubled hands, every reflection holding the same weapon, every reflection trembling just slightly out of rhythm with her. The girl in the leaves smiled again.

“You’ll hit us,” she said. “And you’ll still be here.”

Mitzy raised the spear anyway.

---

## Part 3 — Shattering

Mitzy swung.

The spear cut a bright arc through the clearing, slicing light instead of air. For one clean heartbeat nothing happened—then every leaf screamed.

Not loud. Not noise. More like glass remembering it used to be sand.

The reflection nearest her burst first: colors folded inward, a mouth swallowing itself. The next followed, then another, until the whole glade shattered in ripples, each leaf turning from mirror to something wet and red-brown at the edges.

Mitzy stumbled back, the spear still humming. The smell hit next—green sap and iron, like the time she’d skinned her knee and cried because June hadn’t.

Larry hovered just beyond the wreckage, his wings slow and deliberate. “Feel better?” he asked.

“No.”

“Then why does the Maze?”

She looked around. The clearing had changed shape. The walls stood straighter now, breathing easier. The crushed leaves on the ground pulsed faintly, drinking up the light that leaked through the canopy.

“It wanted you to do that,” Larry said. “You fed it a memory. First taste is always the hardest.”

Mitzy wiped her mouth with the back of her hand. “They were me.”

“Bits of you. Echoes. Every Maze keeps souvenirs.”

“I heard them talk,” she said. “They knew things I never said.”

Larry gave a soft, humorless laugh. “Everybody’s thoughts are loud in here. You’re lucky it hasn’t started singing them back.”

She tightened her grip on the spear. “It’s not true. I never wanted her gone.”

The butterfly tilted in the air, half smile, half shadow. “Good. Keep saying it. The Maze loves a good denial—builds whole wings out of them.”

Mitzy’s knees gave a small, traitorous shake. She jabbed the spear butt into the dirt to steady herself. “What now?”

“Now?” Larry said. “You walk before the glass grows back. Or it’ll start making new faces to fill the cracks.”

She hesitated at the edge of the ruined clearing, eyes on the shards that used to be leaves. They reflected nothing anymore—just dark, wet soil below. Somewhere in that dark, a faint giggle rose and fell.

Mitzy didn’t wait to hear if it was hers.

She ran.

---

## Part 4 — Exit

The path ahead had no edges anymore—just a faint seam of trampled leaves guiding her out. Behind, the clearing stitched itself shut, vines twisting over the ruin with a slow, greedy sound. The mirrored leaves re-formed as she watched, already smoothing their surfaces, already learning a better way to reflect.

Larry glided beside her, quiet for once. His wings made small, exhausted sighs.

“Did I break it?” Mitzy asked.

“Nothing breaks here,” he said. “It only remembers what broke you.”

The spear felt heavier. Sap dried on the blade, leaving a dull, dark bloom. She wiped it on her skirt and the cloth came away streaked green and brown. Her stomach turned.

“I didn’t mean—”

“Sure you did.” Larry’s tone wasn’t cruel; it was simply matter-of-fact. “That’s what makes it work.”

They walked until the light changed from bright sick-green to dim gold. The air cooled. The hum in the walls faded to the slow heartbeat of something sated.

Mitzy stopped and looked back one last time. The clearing was gone—only a ripple of darker hedge where it had been. For a moment she thought she saw faces again, small and pale, pressed into the leaves like fossils. When she blinked, they were gone.

Larry brushed her ear with a wingtip. “Next time, Princess, maybe try talking to yourself before you start stabbing.”

“I didn’t stab me,” she said.

“Of course not,” he said softly. “You never do.”

She glared at him, but he had already risen toward the canopy, a black spark vanishing into gold light.

Mitzy turned forward. The corridor ahead bent in three directions at once. She chose the middle because it looked least certain and began to walk, the Maze whispering faintly after her, each syllable trying out her name in a different voice.

Mitzy. Mitzy. Mitzy.

# Chapter 5 — The Sister’s Room
## Part 1 — The Door That Shouldn't Be

The corridor pinched, then widened again so suddenly that Mitzy had to blink against the light.

It wasn’t green this time. It was _yellow_ — pale, dusty, the colour of late afternoon coming through curtains.

  

The air smelled wrong for the Maze: detergent, soap bubbles, the faint sugar of oatmeal cookies burned around the edges.

She stopped walking.

  

Ahead, the hedges flattened into a wall not of leaves but of painted wood — white, with a doorknob shaped like a glass marble she half-remembered from somewhere that used to be safe.

  

Larry perched on her shoulder. “Oh,” he said quietly. “That trick again.”

  

Mitzy’s throat closed around the words. “That’s— That’s _my house._”

  

“Is it?” Larry asked. “Or does the Maze just like your taste in décor?”

  

She reached for the knob before she could think better of it. The glass marble under her fingers was cool and solid. When she turned it, the door swung inward on the smell of dust and the sound of wind chimes that shouldn’t exist in a hedge.

  

Inside was her room.

Not a copy. Not a memory. _Her_ room.

Pink lamp shade. Crooked poster. The stuffed rabbit with the missing ear sitting exactly where she’d left it two summers ago.

Even the crack in the windowpane had the same spider-shape she’d traced a hundred times when she couldn’t sleep.

  

Mitzy stood in the doorway, heart hammering. “This isn’t real.”

  

Larry stayed in the threshold, wings folded. “That depends who you ask. Memory’s the Maze’s favorite building material.”

  

The rabbit fell over by itself.

---

## Part 2 — The Ghost of June

  

The stuffed rabbit lay face-down on the carpet, one limp paw twitching in the small draft that came from nowhere.

Mitzy stared at it. She didn’t remember leaving the window open. She didn’t remember the Maze _having_ wind.

  

“June?” Her voice came out in the soft, singsong tone she used when they played hide-and-seek and she was pretending not to cheat.

  

No answer.

Just the sound of something light scraping along the desk—pencil, maybe—and the tick of the lamp chain moving back and forth though nobody had touched it.

  

She stepped inside. The carpet had that same worn spot by the bed where she’d paced the week June got sick. The smell of dust was stronger now, layered with something sweeter. Strawberry shampoo.

June’s shampoo.

  

Her chest hurt. She turned in a slow circle.  Everything looked right until she reached the dresser.

The top drawer was open.

  

Inside, neatly folded, were June’s clothes: the striped pajamas, the purple hoodie with the too-long sleeves.

And in the middle—folded like an offering—was one of June’s drawings. Two stick girls holding hands under a yellow sun.

The taller one wore a crown.

  

Mitzy touched the paper. The wax crayon bled onto her fingertip as if the picture were still wet.

  

Behind her, Larry cleared his throat.

“She’s been redecorating,” he said. “You should feel flattered.”

  

Mitzy turned on him. “Why are her things here? This is _my_ room.”

  

He landed on the bedpost, wings barely moving. “Because she’s still your mirror. The Maze likes keeping twins in tidy pairs.”

  

“She’s not my twin.”

  

“Close enough,” he said. “You both dream in the same shapes.”

  

Mitzy looked back at the drawing. The crown on her stick figure’s head glowed faintly, like sunlight remembered.

“Where is she, Larry?”

  

He tilted his head, the movement almost birdlike. “Depends. How much of her do you want to find?”

  

The air thickened; dust motes drifted slower.  The closet door clicked open on its own.

Inside hung a row of clothes—small, bright, too clean—and between them, in the dark, something breathed once, shallow and fast.

  

Mitzy raised the spear.

“June?”

  

A small voice answered from the closet.

“Why did you leave me?”

---

## Part 3 — The Voice in the Closet

Mitzy froze.

The voice wasn’t exactly June’s—it was thinner, hollowed out, as if spoken through a seashell.

Her fingers tightened on the spear shaft until her knuckles ached.

  

“I didn’t,” she said. “You ran. I tried to—”

  

“You didn’t look,” the voice interrupted, still soft, but close enough that it vibrated through the air.

The hanging clothes swayed gently, brushing against one another like leaves in a windless forest.

  

Mitzy took a step closer. The scent of strawberry shampoo hit harder now, layered with something else: damp earth, the smell of the Maze beneath all the soap and memory.

She pushed one sleeve aside. Then another. The closet’s dark deepened.

  

“June?”

  

“Why did you wish it?”

  

Mitzy’s mouth went dry. “Wish what?”

  

“To be alone.”

  

“I didn’t.”

  

“You did,” the voice said. “You said it under your breath, the night I broke your toy horse. You said you wished I’d never—”

  

“Shut up!” Mitzy yelled, thrusting the spear into the closet.

  

The metal hit nothing at first, then caught on something soft.  A sound like exhaling.  The darkness folded inward.

All at once the closet emptied—no clothes, no air, no voice—just a long hollow that smelled like turned soil.

  

Mitzy staggered back, heart pounding.

Behind her, Larry said, very quietly, “You’re not supposed to answer it, Princess. The Maze loves when you answer.”

  

“I didn’t know what else to do.”

  

“Not knowing is safer.”

  

The rabbit rolled across the floor and stopped at her boot, its one glass eye staring up at her.

Mitzy looked down. The fur around its mouth was wet.

  

She wanted to ask what that meant, but Larry had turned away. He was watching the window.

Beyond the glass, the world had changed: no sky now, just hedge pressing against the pane, leaves flat and glistening like skin.

  

Mitzy whispered, “Where’s the door?”

  

Larry didn’t look back. “It left when you came in.”

  

The bed creaked.

Mitzy turned, slowly.

  

Someone was sitting there—small, cross-legged, hair tangled, head bowed.

  

It was June. Or something wearing her face.

---

## Part 4 — The False Sister

June raised her head.

Her eyes were wrong.

Not in color—they were the same gray-green—but in how still they were.  June’s eyes had always darted, hungry for what came next.  These didn’t blink at all.

  

“Hi, Mitzy,” she said.  The voice came clean and warm, exactly as it should, except for the small gap between each word—as if something else had to translate before speaking.

“I missed you.”

  

Mitzy’s throat squeezed tight. “June?”

  

The girl on the bed smiled.  “Don’t sound so surprised.  You came back for me.”

She swung her feet once, the heels tapping the bedframe like a ticking clock.

  

Mitzy’s eyes darted to the spear resting against her leg.  “You’re not real.”

  

June’s smile thinned.  “Neither are you, not anymore.  You’ve been gone a long time.”

  

“I was looking,” Mitzy said.

  

“For me?  Or for what you lost?”

  

Mitzy took a step back.  “Stop it.”

  

Larry flitted between them, circling the false June in cautious loops.  “Careful, Princess.  Some reflections climb out of their mirrors.”

  

June’s gaze snapped toward him.  “You talk too much.”

The air crackled.  Larry dropped half an inch, wings stuttering.  He managed a small laugh, but it was thin.  “Oh, she’s learning tricks now.  That’s adorable.”

  

Mitzy couldn’t look away from her sister.

June looked the same in every detail, down to the chipped nail polish, but the air around her pulsed faintly—as if she were being projected through water.

  

“Why are you here?” Mitzy asked.

  

June tilted her head.  “You brought me.  You always bring me.  The Maze just holds the door.”

She leaned forward, voice dropping low.  “I remember what you said that night.”

  

Mitzy’s stomach flipped.  “No.”

  

“You told Mom it was my fault you lost the rabbit.  That you hated me.  That you wished I’d—”

  

“Stop!”

  

June’s body blurred, flickering between ages—the wide-eyed toddler, the tooth-gap child, the sullen shadow she’d grown into.  “Why?  You like stories.  This one’s yours.”

  

Mitzy lunged forward and grabbed her by the shoulders.  Her hands met something cold and slick.  The shape collapsed under her fingers like melting wax, leaving only the smell of earth and strawberry shampoo.

  

Larry darted close, pulling her back by the hem of her shirt.  “Lesson learned, Princess-Not?”

  

Mitzy stared at the empty bed.  The blanket was wet, dark with a stain that hadn’t been there a heartbeat ago.

Her voice came out thin.  “She’s gone again.”

  

Larry’s tone was almost gentle.  “For now.  But ghosts travel fast here.”

  

Mitzy turned to the window.  The hedge pressed closer against the glass, and in its surface, a single reflection watched her—June’s face, smiling from inside the leaves.

# Act I — The Maze Awakens

*And as quickly begun, it was finished.  
White magic. My little sister. Gone.*

---

# Chapter 1 — White Magic
## Part 1 — Awakening in the Maze

Birdsong trickles down through leaves that knit the sky into tight green lace.

Mitzy blinks. Her cheek is pressed to damp loam, her tongue is fur, and something sweet-rotten breathes from the hedges like old perfume left in a hot car. She pushes up to her elbows. Her knee slips in mud and plants a wet kiss on the ground.  

The hedges are wrong—too tall, too close, too neat in their wildness. Each leaf shines like it has opinions. Above, the canopy narrows to a coin of pale morning. She tests the air with a small, untrusting breath. The smell tastes like cut stems and penny-copper.

“My bed,” she says to the hedge, because there is no one else. The word comes out sandpaper-scratched. “My bed is… not here.”

She sits back on her heels and counts her fingers just to be sure they’ve all come along. Ten. Dirt moons under every nail. A mosquito whines near her ear; she flaps it away and the motion makes the world tilt for a second, a slow spin of leaf and light. When it steadies, her name blooms behind her eyes like someone wrote it there with a matchtip: Mitzy.

June, follows after, smaller.

She swallows hard. The swallow has edges.

The ground is littered with dry boxwood crumbs and a few pale berries like little teeth. She lifts one to sniff it and decides, solemnly, not to find out what it does. A narrow corridor runs left and right, hedge to hedge, floor of hard-packed dirt scored with faint grooves like something heavy was dragged along long ago and then again, later.

“Hello?” Her voice thins as it moves away from her, a ribbon pulled off a spool. The Maze eats it. No answer, just that water-bright birdsong somewhere too high to belong to this place.

A horsefly smacks the back of her neck. She slaps and misses. “Ow.” The sound is too loud; everything else is muffled, like the world is under a blanket and she isn’t.

She touches her hairline and finds a tender bump, a little mountain that wasn’t there yesterday—or maybe yesterday didn’t happen, maybe yesterday is folded up in somebody else’s drawer. She lowers her hand and stares at the smear of green where a leaf kissed her skin too hard.

“June?” she tries again, softer. The name seems braver when it’s small. She imagines her sister’s hand—warm, sticky from jam, always sticky—and her own hand not holding it.

Mitzy gets to her feet. The hedges make a throat around her and she is inside it. She takes one step. The leaves whisper against each other like they have secrets. She takes another step and the whispering stops, as if caught listening.

She tests the right-hand path with her toes and the dirt there is damp-cool, packed tight; the left-hand path breathes a faint, stale heat. She chooses the cooler air because it feels less like a mouth.

“Don’t be dumb,” she tells herself, and the hedges titter. She squares her shoulders and the tittering dies. Good.

A small hush falls, more serious than silence. Something moves in it—soft, deliberate, weightless.

A black butterfly drops out of the green like a burned petal and lands on Mitzy’s cheek, light as a lie.

---

## Part 2 — Larry's Entrance

The butterfly flexes its wings once, twice. Each flick fans the smell of scorched paper. Its body is velvet-dark, striped faintly with dust. Mitzy goes cross-eyed trying to see it. Its feelers brush her nose and she nearly sneezes.

“Hey-ho, princess,” it says.

The words tickle through her skin more than her ear. Mitzy flinches backward so hard she smacks the hedge with her shoulder. The leaves prickle—too hot, too sharp. She jerks forward again, hugging her arms to her chest.

  

The butterfly lifts away, fluttering in a careless loop.

  

“Wh-what?” she stammers.

  

“You heard me.” The voice is smoke-thick, too deep for something so small. It circles once and then hovers just above her eye line, wings folding and unfolding as though it is bored already. “Hey-ho, princess.”

  

Mitzy licks her lips. Her tongue tastes of dirt. “I’m… not a princess.”

  

The butterfly dips as if shrugging. “Course you’re not. That’s why it’s funny.”

  

Her heartbeat is trying to dig its way out of her throat. She lifts one hand, palm out, the way she’s seen grownups calm dogs. “Butterflies don’t talk.”

  

The insect yawns—actually yawns—and it sounds like her Uncle Bart hacking through pipe smoke. “Sure we do. Just most of you don’t bother listening.”

  

Mitzy stares. Her mouth wants to say _this is a dream,_ but the hedge-thorns pressing into her shoulder still sting, and the damp dirt still coats her knee. This isn’t dream-soft.

  

The butterfly drifts closer until its antennae are a whisker from her nose. “What’s your name then, Not-a-Princess?”

  

She hugs her arms tighter. “Mitzy.”

  

“Mitzy.” It tastes the word like soup, then coughs. “Hnh. That’ll do. You can call me Larry.”

  

Mitzy blinks. “Larry? That’s not a butterfly name.”

  

“Better than ‘Toots,’” Larry says, and rubs his front legs together with a dry rasp that makes her scalp crawl.

  

Mitzy swats at him. He dodges neatly, laughing as he corkscrews back up into the green light.

  

Her voice comes sharper than she intends: “Why are you talking to me?”

  

Larry hovers, wings twitching. “Because you’re lost, princess. And because you’re about to find something sharp.”

  

Mitzy frowns. “Something sharp?”

  

Larry just grins—if butterflies can grin—and darts toward the corridor’s bend. “Come on. It’s waiting.”

---

## Part 3 — The Iron Ivy

Larry darts ahead, a quick streak of soot against the green.

Mitzy follows because there’s nothing else to follow—the Maze gives only one direction at a time. The air thickens, humid and mint-bitter. When she tries to breathe through her mouth it tastes like pennies and leaves.

  

“Keep up,” Larry calls. “It hates laggers.”

  

“It?” she pants.

  

“The Maze,” he says, like that should be obvious.

  

The corridor bends again, and sunlight leaks through in a single golden stripe, thin as a sword edge.  At its center juts an iron post, half-buried, its head worked with curling vines that mimic the hedges themselves.

  

Mitzy slows.  The metal sweats dew, or maybe something that only looks like it.  Her reflection slides along its dark length—eyes wide, skin ghost-pale, hair full of leaf bits.

  

Larry lands atop it and drums his forelegs. _Ping ping._

“Pretty, huh? Been waiting for you.”

  

Mitzy wipes her palms on her skirt. “For me?”

  

He nods toward the base where the earth splits slightly. “Grab hold.”

  

She hesitates.  The air hums, faint and electric, and the post trembles once as if eager.

  

“Go on,” Larry says, voice suddenly low. “It won’t bite. Yet.”

  

Mitzy wraps both hands around the shaft. The metal is cold enough to burn. She braces one foot, pulls, and the ground gives with a wet pop. The post slides free—a spear, longer than she is tall, ending in a squared ivy-leaf blade dark with age.

  

The weight settles into her arms like it remembers her.

  

Larry whistles. “Well look at that. Princess gets her wand.”

  

“It’s not a wand,” she mutters, testing the balance. The point gleams once in the stripe of sun.  She feels a small thrill—fear’s thinner cousin—run up her spine.

  

“That’s the spirit,” Larry says. “Every maze loves a weapon. Makes the ending tidy.”

  

Mitzy frowns. “What ending?”

  

But he only laughs, a dry fluttering sound that rattles through the hedges.

---

## Part 4 -- The Warning

Mitzy plants the spear in the dirt and leans on it, breath huffing through her teeth. The air here feels heavier, syrup-thick with green. When she glances down, she notices a small placard hanging from the post’s hollow socket—something she hadn’t seen while pulling it free.

  

The sign swings lazily on two rusted chains.  Words are carved into it, not cleanly but gouged, as if by claws or a knife used too many times.  The letters shimmer for a heartbeat, then settle into sense.

  

**YOU HAVE ONE HOUR.**

**DON’T TOUCH THE WALLS.**

  

Mitzy frowns. “One hour for what?”

  

Larry flits closer, his wings clapping faintly in the damp air. “For it to decide what to do with you.”

  

“That’s not funny.”

  

“Wasn’t a joke.”

  

She presses her lips together. The sign creaks once and goes still, as though waiting for her to read it again.

  

“Don’t touch the walls,” she repeats. “What happens if I do?”

  

“Try it and find out,” Larry says, landing lightly on the top edge of the spear. “You’ll learn fast.”

  

Mitzy glares up at him. “You’re awful.”

  

“True,” he says cheerfully. “But useful. Keep me alive and maybe I’ll keep you the same.”

  

She ignores him and stares down the nearest corridor, where the hedges bow toward each other like two tall old ladies whispering. The light beyond them is dimmer, tinged green-black.

  

June’s face swims up in her memory—eyes bright with some secret, cheeks full of crumbs from the last piece of toast. The thought tightens her throat.

  

“I’m coming for you,” she whispers.

  

The Maze answers with a sigh. It could be wind. It could be breathing.

  

Mitzy lifts the spear, sets her shoulders, and steps into the shadowed corridor. The sign behind her twists on its chain and clinks softly, like a clock marking the first second gone.

# Chapter 6 — The Chorus of Sisters
## Part 1 — Whispers in the Hedges

Mitzy left the room and didn’t look back.

There was no door anymore, only hedge—fresh, new, and wet-looking, as though the Maze had just grown over her memory to keep it warm.

The path ahead stretched in two directions that couldn’t possibly meet.  She picked one because it felt less sure of itself.

  

Larry floated ahead of her again, small, dark, quiet.  His silence felt heavier than his jokes ever had.

  

The corridor wound downward, the ground turning spongy.  The smell of dirt thickened, and the walls began to hum—a faint, tuneless vibration, like someone singing through a wall in another house.

  

Mitzy slowed.  “What’s that?”

  

Larry tilted his wings, listening.  “The Maze humming to itself.”

  

“It knows songs?”

  

“Only the ones it’s eaten.”

  

The humming grew louder as they walked.  Not one voice—hundreds.  Whispers running under one another until the words tangled.  At first she thought it was leaves moving in wind, but there was no wind here, and some of the whispers sounded like laughter, some like crying, some like hers.

  

She stopped.  “Larry… what is it?”

  

He didn’t answer right away.  Then, “The alumni association.”

  

She frowned.  “What’s that?”

  

“All the ones who came before.  The Maze doesn’t let good material go to waste.”

  

The whispers shifted as if hearing him.  A few rose above the rest, brief and desperate:

_“Find her.”_

_“Don’t turn around.”_

_“He’s still hungry.”_

  

Mitzy pressed her hands to her ears.  The sound didn’t stop.  It pressed through skin, humming behind her teeth.

  

“I can’t—make them—stop!”

  

“Can’t stop a choir, Princess,” Larry said.  “Best you can do is change the tune.”

  

“How?”

  

“Walk louder.”

  

She started forward, faster.  The voices swelled with her steps, harmonizing, matching her rhythm like a heartbeat under her own.  Some sounded her age.  Some sounded like mothers.  Some were no age at all.

  

When she passed a gap in the hedge, she caught glimpses between the leaves—shapes like faces, pale and still, lips moving in unison.  Eyes closed.  Or gone.

  

One of them looked almost like her.

  

Mitzy stumbled.  “Larry, they—”

  

“Keep walking.”

  

“I think they know me.”

  

“They _are_ you,” he said softly.  “Or close enough for the Maze to confuse the difference.”

  

The whisper nearest her ear sighed her name in chorus—_Mitzy-Mitzy-Mitzy_—each syllable overlapping the next until it turned into breathing again.

  

She didn’t run this time.  She just kept moving, slower, careful, eyes on Larry’s flicker of black ahead of her.

---

## Part 2 — The Carvings

The path dipped lower, until her boots sank in dark mud that clung like hands.  The walls leaned closer; their bases were bare of leaves, showing the Maze’s roots—thick cords of wood knotted into shapes that almost looked deliberate.

  

Mitzy paused.  At first she thought she saw bugs glinting on the bark.  Then she leaned in.

  

Not bugs.  Letters.

  

Someone had carved words into the exposed wood.  Names.  Dozens of them, etched with desperate strokes: _Mara. Elsie. June. Annelise._

She stopped at the third and touched it, half disbelieving.  The grooves were still sticky, like sap that hadn’t finished bleeding.

  

Larry hovered over her shoulder.  “Don’t touch, Princess.”

  

“It’s her name.”

  

“They all are.”

  

Mitzy looked closer.  The letters spiraled deeper along the root until the writing folded into symbols she didn’t understand.  Circles.  Spirals.  Little crown-shapes repeated over and over.

“How many?” she whispered.

  

“Enough to make a choir.”

  

“Who carved them?”

  

“Whoever the Maze still let move their hands.”

  

She pulled her fingers back, heart stuttering.  “They were all sisters?”

  

“Every one.”

  

The next root bore scratches instead of letters—a pattern of short lines, the kind she’d used to count down days on a wall once, when she’d been grounded for hiding June’s doll.

She traced the final mark.  It cut deeper, crooked, ending in a splinter.

  

“Larry,” she said, “I think they were counting time.”

  

He didn’t answer.

  

The whispering from before returned, soft, wet, almost affectionate.  The carved names quivered as if the voices came from inside the wood itself.

  

_Come find us._

_Find her._

_Finish it._

  

Mitzy backed away.  The nearest name shone briefly before the bark healed over, swallowing the letters whole.

  

Larry said, “That’s the Maze for you—never sentimental.”

  

Mitzy gripped the spear until her hands stopped shaking.  “I don’t want to end up a name on a root.”

  

“Then make sure someone else does first,” Larry said lightly, and flew on.

  

She stared at the place where the names had been.  The bark was smooth now, but she could still feel the grooves beneath her skin, ghost-deep.  When she finally moved to follow, one word echoed in her head, not from the Maze, but her own thought trying to sound like courage:

  

_Survive._

---

## Part 3 — The Relic

The ground levelled into a hollow slick with rainwater that had never seen sky.  The reflection on its surface was pale and wrong, a picture of leaves bending the wrong direction.

  

Mitzy stepped around it carefully.  Her boot touched something hard just beneath the skin of mud.  She crouched, scraping at it with her fingertips until she uncovered a shape.

  

A small, iron pendant.

Twisted into the rough outline of two girls hand-in-hand.

  

She wiped it clean on her sleeve. The iron smelled faintly of salt and old blood.

The figures’ faces were gone, worn flat.

But around the edge someone had carved words small as pin scratches:

**WE WALK TOGETHER UNTIL ONE STOPS.**

  

Larry drifted low, his wings stirring the puddle into circles.

“Souvenir?”

  

“It’s theirs,” she said.

  

“Yours now.”

  

Mitzy shook her head. “It feels… wrong.”

  

“Everything worth keeping does,” Larry said. “That’s how the Maze remembers who tried.”

  

She looked closer at the pendant.

A faint red shimmer pulsed through the grooves of the metal, fading in and out with her heartbeat.  When she turned it over, the back bore a second phrase:

**GOBLIN’S MARK.**

  

Her stomach dropped. “Larry… this isn’t just a trinket.”

  

He didn’t answer at first.  Then he said, “No.  It’s a contract.”

  

“A what?”

  

“Some sisters made deals.  Some didn’t.  Guess which kind still have voices.”

  

Mitzy held the pendant at arm’s length. “It belongs to one of them. I can’t keep it.”

  

“Sure you can.  You picked it up.”

  

“I don’t want it.”

  

“You think that matters?”

  

The puddle at her feet quivered.  A single bubble rose and popped.

For a moment, beneath the surface, she saw another hand—smaller than hers, reaching toward the pendant with a motion exactly matching her own.

  

She flung it down.

The pendant sank soundlessly into the water, the light dying with it.

  

Larry sighed.  “That was unwise.”

  

“Why?”

  

“Now it knows your name.”

  

The puddle darkened until it was just shadow.  From its center came a murmur, thin and low:

_Mitzy…_

  

Larry’s voice sharpened.  “Walk away.”

  

She ran.  The whisper followed, a ripple that moved under the path itself, echoing each of her footsteps like a heartbeat chasing her own.

---

## Part 4 — The Names in the Dark

The path dipped again, swallowing what little light the Maze pretended to have.

Mitzy’s breath came shallow, clouding the air in front of her even though it wasn’t cold.  The darkness had weight here.  Each step pressed through it like wading into tar.

  

Behind her, the puddle’s voice faded, but new ones rose to replace it.

Not whispers this time—**names**, spoken in careful rhythm, one after another.

She recognized none of them at first.  Then one hit her gut like a stone.

  

“June.”

  

Mitzy stopped dead.

  

The air hummed; the walls glowed faintly with veins of green light running under the leaves.  In that light, the roots and branches weren’t roots or branches anymore but **arms**, hundreds of them, reaching from inside the Maze.

Each hand held a pendant like the one she’d found.  Each pendant pulsed red, the rhythm steady, heartbeat slow and patient.

  

Larry came to rest on her shoulder.  “Don’t listen.”

  

“She said my sister’s name.”

  

“They all do eventually.”

  

“But—what if she’s—”

  

“She’s not.”

  

He said it quickly. Too quickly.

  

The arms stirred.  Some reached higher, their fingers curling in invitation.

Mitzy stepped back, but the whisper followed, breaking from the unison into overlapping pleas.

  

_Don’t stop._

_We walked too far._

_He’s still hungry._

_Finish what we couldn’t._

  

Larry hissed.  “Keep walking, Princess.  The dead get chatty when they smell company.”

  

Mitzy took one step backward.  The ground flexed.  Hands burst from the soil around her boots, thin and bark-skinned, clutching at her ankles.  She gasped and struck down with the spear.

The blade cut through one wrist.  Sap—no, blood—splattered warm against her shins.

  

The severed hand clung to the spear for a heartbeat longer before dropping.  The voice that had said _June_ screamed once and went silent.

  

Larry’s tone dropped to a near whisper.  “Now they know you bite.”

  

Mitzy trembled.  “They’re trying to pull me down.”

  

“They’re trying to make you stay.  That’s how they sing.”

  

The arms sank again, the last few brushing against her knees like reluctant children before disappearing into the soil.  The red light faded, leaving her and Larry alone with the dark again.

  

Mitzy wiped the spear tip clean on the hem of her skirt.  The smear glowed faintly for a moment, then dimmed.

  

“Larry?” she whispered.

  

“Yes, Princess?”

  

“Are they… gone?”

  

He hovered close, voice smaller than she’d ever heard it.  “No.  They’re just waiting for the refrain.”

# Chapter 2 — Larry’s Bargain
## Part 1 — Larry's Mockery
The path narrowed to a cough of light between walls slick with dew.  Mitzy’s shoes made no sound on the dirt—too soft, like stepping on fur.  Larry drifted ahead, wings whispering, a moving blot in the green gloom.

  

“You’re quiet, Princess,” he called back.  “Thinking’s dangerous here.  The Maze can smell it.”

  

Mitzy tightened her grip on the spear.  “Stop calling me that.”

  

“What—Princess?” he asked, feigning shock.  “You don’t like it?  You seem the type.  You’ve got that whole chin-up thing.  Regal denial.  Classic princess move.”

  

“I’m not one.”

  

“Fine.  Not-a-Princess then.  Rolls off the tongue.  You should get it monogrammed.”

He dipped low enough that his shadow skated across her knuckles.  “Where’s June these days, anyway?  Still stealing your toys?  Still stealing your thunder?”

  

The words struck harder than thorns.  Mitzy kept walking.  “She’s lost,” she said.  “I’m finding her.”

  

Larry snorted, a small explosion of dust.  “Lost, huh.  That’s one way to put it.  Some sisters go missing.  Others get misplaced on purpose.”

  

“Shut up.”

  

He laughed softly.  “Touched a nerve.”

  

“I said shut up!”

  

Her shout hit the hedges like a stone in water.  Ripples ran through the leaves, and the whole corridor shivered.  A faint humming started somewhere deep inside the green, a heartbeat not hers.

  

Larry twirled above her head, pleased.  “See?  The Maze likes honesty.  Don’t worry—it only bites the liars.”

  

Mitzy clenched her jaw until her teeth ached.  “You don’t know anything about me.”

  

“Know enough,” he said, and suddenly he wasn’t joking.  “You think being the big sister makes you the hero.  It doesn’t.  It just gives you the sharper knife.”

  

She stopped walking.  “What did you say?”

  

Larry landed on a branch at eye level, wings closing like two black hands.  “Don’t look at me like that.  I’m just repeating what it tells me.”

  

“The Maze?”

  

He nodded.  “It remembers things.  Little things.  Who tripped who.  Who whispered what.  Who wished the other would just… disappear.”

  

Mitzy’s stomach turned cold.  “That’s a lie.”

  

“Then the Maze won’t mind hearing it again.”

  

He fluttered higher, out of reach.  “Come on, Princess-Not.  Keep up.  The walls move faster when you sulk.”
---

## Part 2 — First Hints of Jealousy

Mitzy followed because there was nowhere else to go.

The Maze pinched tighter, hedges closing like the pages of a book being read too fast.  A few thin beams of light speared through, green-edged and restless.

  

Larry floated backward in front of her, flying the way dust dances.  “Tell me about June,” he said, casual as a yawn.  “Was she the good one?”

  

“She’s—” Mitzy stopped.  The word wouldn’t shape right.  “She’s just June.”

  

“Ah,” Larry said, drawing out the sound like a violin string.  “_Just_ June.  The Maze loves that word.  It always comes before the bite.”

  

Mitzy glared at him.  “You’re trying to scare me.”

  

“Of course I am.  If I don’t, you’ll get sloppy and die.  Fear’s like caffeine here.”  He fluttered to her shoulder and clung to the fabric of her sleeve.  His feet were lighter than thought, but his voice pressed heavy in her ear.  “So, tell me.  Did you ever wish she’d stayed gone?  Even for a minute?”

  

Mitzy’s throat locked.  “No.”

  

Larry chuckled, wings brushing her cheek.  “The Maze says otherwise.”

  

She knocked him off with the back of her hand, harder than she meant to.  He spun once, caught himself midair, and looked almost delighted.

  

“There she is,” he said.  “A spark of truth at last.”

  

Mitzy’s breath came hot.  “I didn’t mean it.  She—she always—”

  

“—took what was yours?” he finished for her.  “Attention.  Toys.  Maybe love?”

  

Mitzy jabbed the spear’s butt into the ground.  The dirt shivered underfoot, rippling outward like water.  The hedges sighed, bending toward her.

  

Larry’s tone softened, just a little.  “Careful, kid.  The Maze hears tone better than words.”

  

“What’s that mean?”

  

“Means if you keep talking like that, you’ll end up sounding like me.”

  

He turned midair, his wings catching a sickly flash of light, and drifted deeper into the tunnel.  “Come on.  Goblins don’t wait forever.”

  

Mitzy stayed where she was, the spear trembling in her hands.  The ground still moved beneath her boots, slow and pulsing, like the Maze was breathing through her anger.

When she finally stepped forward, the walls whispered her name — soft, imitating Larry’s voice.

  

_Mitzy.  Mitzy.  Mitzy._

  

She walked faster.


---

## Part 3 — The Walls Respond

The corridor kept narrowing until Mitzy could feel the brush of leaves against her sleeves.  They whispered when she moved—tiny wet sounds, like lips tasting rain.

She tried to ignore it, but the hedges were breathing again.  She could _hear_ the rhythm if she matched her steps to it.

  

Breathe in.

Step.

Breathe out.

Step.

  

A leaf grazed her wrist and left a damp mark, the shape of a hand too small to be her own.

  

“Larry,” she called.  Her voice sounded thick, stuck in syrup.

No answer—just the faint clatter of wings somewhere ahead.

  

The spear weighed heavier now.  When she shifted it to her other hand, the ground beneath her feet rippled again, faint but deliberate.  The Maze was awake.

  

She stopped.  “I said—Larry!”

  

The whispering hushed.  A moment later, a thousand whispers answered all at once.  Her name again, layered and folding:

_Mitzy.  Mitzy.  Mitzy._

  

Each echo leaned closer until she couldn’t tell where they were coming from—above, behind, inside her.  The sound pressed against her skin like invisible hands.

She swung the spear in front of her, slicing air.  The voices broke into laughter.

  

“Not funny!” she yelled.

  

“Oh, I think it’s hilarious,” said Larry, gliding back from the dark.  His voice carried a grin she could hear.  “You’re finally in conversation with the place.”

  

Mitzy glared at him.  “Make it stop.”

  

“Can’t.  You started it.”

  

“What did I do?”

  

“You thought too loud.”

  

“That’s stupid.”

  

“Yep.”  Larry perched on a branch and folded his wings.  “Welcome to stupid country.”

  

The laughter of the Maze thinned to a giggle, then to breathing again.  Mitzy’s shoulders loosened, just barely.

  

“It talks like you,” she said.

  

Larry preened.  “Maybe I talk like it.”

  

She stared at him.  “That supposed to help?”

  

“Not particularly.”

  

Mitzy rolled her eyes, though the motion felt brittle.  “You’re the worst guide ever.”

  

“Funny thing about that,” Larry said.  “Guides don’t have to like where they’re going.”

  

He nodded ahead.  “Come on, Princess.  The Maze won’t wait forever.  And neither will the Goblin.”

  

Mitzy tightened her grip on the spear and stepped after him, but now every leaf she brushed against whispered her name as she passed, slow and pleased.

  

_Mitzy.  Mitzy.  Mitzy._

  

Each repetition sounded a little more like June.

---

## Part 4 — The Bargain Struck

The tunnel widened again without warning, opening into a shallow bowl of light.  Vines hung like ribs from the hedges, dripping pale sap that smoked when it hit the ground.  The smell was sugar and rust.

  

Larry coasted down until he floated just in front of her face.  “Breathe easy, Princess.  This is a rest stop.”

  

“I don’t need to rest.”

  

“Everyone needs to rest.  Some just don’t wake up afterward.”  He grinned.  “Kidding.  Mostly.”

  

Mitzy planted the spear in the dirt and sat.  The earth was warm.  She wiped sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand.  “You said there’s a Goblin.”

  

“There’s always a Goblin,” Larry said.  “Maze’s way of giving people something to blame.”

  

“What is it?”

  

“Depends who you ask.  Sometimes it’s teeth.  Sometimes it’s regret with claws.”

  

Mitzy frowned.  “You’re not helping.”

  

“I’m trying,” he said, tone softening for the first time.  “The Maze keeps its monsters custom-made.  But the rules stay simple:  find it, kill it, and maybe—_maybe_—you walk out with your heart still where you left it.”

  

“And June?”

  

“Ah, June.”  Larry’s wings beat once, stirring the sweet air.  “She’s in here somewhere.  Or something wearing her shape is.  Either way, you’ll meet her at the end.”

  

Mitzy’s throat tightened.  “How do you know?”

  

“Because the Maze told me.”

  

“That’s a lie.”

  

He tilted his head.  “Then we’ll find out which of us it likes better.”

  

She looked down at the spear.  The ivy carved along its length seemed to pulse, faintly breathing with her.  “If I find the Goblin and kill it, June goes home?”

  

Larry nodded.  “That’s the bargain.”

  

“And if I don’t?”

  

“Then you stay.  Maze needs someone to keep the candles lit.”

  

Mitzy rose.  “Fine.”  She lifted the spear.  “I’ll find it.”

  

Larry laughed, quiet and pleased.  “Good girl.”

  

“Don’t call me that.”

  

“Fine.  Good killer.”

  

She glared.  “Shut up.”

  

But he only twirled upward into the canopy, black wings slicing the light.  “Clock’s ticking, Princess-Not.  Let’s go earn that hour.”

  

The whisper came again from the hedges as she stepped forward:

_Mitzy.  Mitzy.  Mitzy._

Now it sounded almost like applause.

# Chapter 3 — The First Bending
## Part 1 — Circles

_Echo:_ _Mitzy. Mitzy. Mitzy._ The whisper followed like polite clapping that wouldn’t stop.

  

The sound rode her shoulders as she walked, soft as moth wings, patient as rain. Larry drifted ahead, a soot-flake that refused to land. The corridor looked ordinary at first—dirt floor, boxwood walls sweating green—but the ordinary kept rearranging itself when she blinked, like a picture someone couldn’t decide how to hang.

  

Mitzy stepped over a fallen twig with a split end like a snake’s tongue. Ten paces later she stepped over the same twig again. She recognized the muddy crescent of her own boot print beside it, already drying at the edges.

  

“Larry,” she said.

  

“Mmm?” He didn’t look back.

  

“We were here.”

  

“Every minute,” he said lightly. “You’re just catching up.”

  

She scowled at his back and kept going. Left bend, short straight, shallow dip where the dirt held a darker seam. She counted—one, two, three—turned right, and met the twig for the third time. The Maze pretended it had never seen her before, and the pretence made her teeth ache.

  

“Stop it,” she told the path.

  

It stopped. That is, it paused just long enough for her to wonder if stopping meant winning, and then it offered the same shallow dip with a little extra tilt, as if the Maze had cocked its head.

  

Mitzy set the butt of the spear on the ground, hard. The shock went up her arms the way laughter sometimes does when you’re not supposed to laugh. Birds were singing far above, the same tune as before, but the notes fell in a new order, and that made the song feel wrong.

  

“Tell me it’s a trick,” she said. “Say there’s a mirror. A loop. Say something that makes sense.”

  

Larry angled back toward her in a lazy figure-eight. “All mazes are loops. This one just likes to brag about it.”

  

“That isn’t helpful.”

  

“Helps me,” he said.

  

Mitzy crouched and touched the mud. Her earlier boot print fit her toes like a mold. A line dragged through the dirt nearby—long, shallow, a mark she didn’t remember making. She traced it to a scuffed place where something heavy had turned. For a breath she could see it: a girl her size pulling an iron post from the ground, the blade kissing air, the weight dragging a scar.

  

“Was that me?” she whispered.

  

Larry hovered lower until his shadow crowned her head. “If you don’t like the answer, pick a better question.”

  

She stood. The corridor ahead was the same corridor ahead. She hated it for acting clever. “Fine,” she said to the hedge. “Let’s see how clever.”

  

She took the left bend and kept her eyes on the seam where wall met floor. She counted the breaths between the birds’ falling notes. She dragged the spearpoint just enough to leave a bright line along the dirt—thin, shining, proof. At the shallow dip she tilted the blade and carved an X. When the path turned right, she didn’t. She pushed into the leaves instead, not touching—she remembered the sign—but close enough to feel their cold breath on her arms.

  

The hedge hissed, offended. She eased back onto the corridor before it could decide what to do about her. Ten paces. The twig. The boot print. The X she carved, waiting like a smirk.

  

Mitzy’s throat tightened. “No.”

  

The Maze purred. It wasn’t a sound so much as a pleased loosening under her feet, as if the ground had smiled.

  

Larry clicked his tongue. “Princess-Not, meet your own orbit. Your orbit, meet the Princess.”

  

“I’m not orbiting,” she said, but the word came out thinner than she wanted. She set off again, faster. The corridor obliged, unspooling like ribbon, happy to be chased.

  

Left bend, dip, right bend, twig, X. Left bend, dip, right bend, twig, X. Mitzy’s breath came faster. The hedges leaned in like old women eager for gossip. She tried a new game—backwards steps, eyes closed for three heartbeats, point the spear at the exact center of her sternum and pivot left on the heel. When she opened her eyes, the twig waited, tongue split and laughing.

  

“Larry.” It was a warning this time, and a plea.

  

He gave a small, approving hum. “Now you’re speaking its language.”

  

“I’m speaking _angry_.”

  

“Same dialect.”

  

Mitzy planted the spear, chest heaving. The applause-whisper of her name had thinned to a steady murmur, the way a crowd sounds when it thinks you’re about to perform.

  

She looked up. The coin of sky still hung there, pale and careless. Something about that calm edge above made the corridor’s sameness feel like mockery.

  

“I’m not your joke,” she said to the Maze. “Find someone else.”

  

The leaves rustled, pleased that she’d said anything at all. The path ahead brightened by a hair, as if the Maze had leaned back to get a better look at her.

  

Mitzy wiped her palms on her skirt and set the spear across her shoulders, the way she’d seen men carry tools when they wanted to show they weren’t tired. She took one more step and felt the unseen circle tilt underfoot, just slightly, like a plate being slid from a table without the glasses falling.

  

“Did you feel that?” she asked.

  

Larry’s wings slowed, the air around him quivering like heat over stone. “Oh, it felt you,” he said. “Keep going.”

  

Mitzy did. The twig stayed where it was. The X did not. Somewhere between one breath and the next, the X had gone faint, as if the Maze were swallowing the line she’d drawn into its tongue.

  

She swallowed too, because her mouth had gone dry. “If I’m the loop, then I can unloop.”

  

“That’s the spirit,” Larry said. “All you have to do is stop being you.”

  

Mitzy stared at the bend that waited like a suggestion. “How hard can that be,” she said, and took it.

---

## Part 2 — Pressure

The bend didn’t open into new ground.

It curved inward, tighter, like something had inhaled and forgotten how to exhale.

  

The air thickened with the smell of sap and heat. Each breath scratched her throat.

Leaves brushed her arms; their undersides were wet and cool, and when they touched her skin, she felt a faint pulse—tiny heartbeats that didn’t belong to her.

  

Mitzy stopped. “It’s closer.”

  

Larry landed on the spear haft, wings half-open. “No, Princess. You’re bigger. The Maze doesn’t like that.”

  

“I’m not bigger.”

  

“You think louder, same thing.”

  

She turned in a circle. The corridor was now a narrow green throat, the walls bowing toward her like they wanted to whisper something directly into her bones.

She raised the spear. The blade caught a trickle of light and gleamed—a fragile thing pretending to be brave.

  

“Back up,” she said. “Give me room.”

  

The hedges didn’t.

They breathed.

  

The sound wasn’t wind. It was the slow draw of lungs, the creak of branches bending inward.

Mitzy could see the leaves tremble, the stems straining toward her face like reaching fingers.

  

“Stop it!” she shouted.

  

The Maze sighed in answer.

And moved.

  

A long shudder ran through the corridor. The walls pressed closer until she could feel their damp chill against her shoulders. A branch snagged a thread of her hair and pulled.

  

Larry hovered above her head, circling once. “Told you not to think so loud.”

  

“I’m _not_ thinking!” she snapped.

  

“Ah. There’s your problem—you’re feeling instead.”

  

“Then make it stop!”

  

“Can’t,” he said. “You started the dance.”

  

She swung the spear sideways. The tip brushed the leaves but didn’t touch them—she remembered the warning—but even that nearness made the Maze twitch.

The sound it made wasn’t pain, exactly. More like surprise.

Mitzy took another step back and her heel sank into the mud. It sucked at her boot like a mouth.

  

“Larry!”

  

“I’m here,” he said, though his voice came from behind her now. “Don’t panic.”

  

The mud climbed her ankle. The walls breathed again, closer, closer still.

  

Mitzy fought for a deep breath and said through her teeth, “I’m not scared.”

  

The Maze’s pulse quickened.

Leaves quivered, roots flexed beneath the dirt.

  

“Say that again,” Larry whispered.

  

“I’m not—”

  

The ground lurched.

A sound tore through the air, part groan, part laugh.  The hedges bent back, then forward again, snapping into a new shape so fast she stumbled.

When she looked up, the corridor was different.

The sky above had vanished.  The path now spiraled downward, smooth and damp, lit from beneath by a green glow that throbbed with her pulse.

  

Mitzy swallowed hard. “What did it just do?”

  

Larry landed lightly on her shoulder. His voice was soft now, stripped of its usual mocking edge.

“It bent,” he said. “You taught it how.”

  

Mitzy looked around—the twisted passage, the slick green light, the living air that knew her name.

Her whisper barely made it past her lips.

“Then what’s it going to do next?”

  

Larry didn’t answer.

  

He just nodded toward the spiral.

“Depends on what you’re about to feel.”

---

## Part 3 — The Spiral

The spiral coiled ahead like a shell turned inside out.

Its walls were smoother than before—no leaves now, only glistening skin the color of new moss. Light pulsed under the surface, a rhythm that didn’t match her heartbeat but wanted to.

  

Mitzy stepped onto the slope. The air was thicker here, heavier, as if she’d walked underwater without noticing. Each breath tasted like mint and copper.

  

Larry followed, wings brushing her cheek. “Slow down. Mazes hate impatience.”

  

“I want out.”

  

“Everyone does. It’s what keeps them walking.”

  

Mitzy took another step. The floor flexed beneath her boots, soft as wet paper. She lifted her foot and saw the faint print it left behind glowing briefly before fading. She imagined she could hear the Maze sigh in satisfaction, like it had been waiting for her to leave her mark.

  

The tunnel tightened. She had to angle the spear sideways to keep moving.

Something about the curve made her dizzy; it wasn’t just turning downward—it was turning **around her**, folding her in its geometry.

She felt the world bend and realized it wasn’t just the path. It was her.

  

Her thoughts kept doubling back. Every time she tried to picture June’s face, it slipped into her own.

The two faces twisted together until she couldn’t tell whose memory she was holding.

She stopped walking and pressed her forehead against the spear’s cold shaft.

  

“Larry,” she whispered. “I can’t remember her voice.”

  

He hovered in front of her, wings flickering faint blue in the half-light.

“Memory’s just another wall, Princess. Push too hard and you flatten what’s behind it.”

  

“But if I forget her—”

  

“You won’t,” he said, and for once the sarcasm fell away. “The Maze remembers for you.”

  

She looked up. “That’s supposed to help?”

  

“No,” he said. “It’s supposed to scare you into walking.”

  

Mitzy kept moving. The spiral steepened, each curve tighter than the last.

The glow under the floor thickened to a heartbeat, slow and patient.

It felt like walking across the inside of a giant lung. The air moved with her steps.

  

At the curve’s next turn, she saw motion ahead—her own silhouette, seconds delayed, rounding the bend before her.

  

“Larry?”

  

“Yes, Princess.”

  

“Is that… me?”

  

The butterfly tilted. “Depends which of you asks first.”

  

Her shadow turned to face her.

Mitzy froze.

  

The shape smiled—a thin, knowing grin she didn’t recognize—and mouthed something she couldn’t hear.

  

The walls leaned closer, eager to listen.

  

Mitzy’s spear trembled in her hands. “It’s saying something.”

  

“Don’t answer,” Larry said quickly.

  

But she already had.

  

“I can’t hear you,” Mitzy whispered.

  

Her shadow blinked, and its eyes opened into light.

---

## Part 4 — The Lesson

Her shadow blinked again, light pouring from the sockets like water through cracks.

The glow sloshed across the spiral walls, staining them bright green, until Mitzy could see herself—_herself_—standing just ahead, as solid as breath in cold air.

  

Same clothes. Same spear. Same dirt smudge on the chin.

But the other girl’s eyes glowed steady where Mitzy’s trembled.

  

“Hello?” Mitzy managed.

  

The copy tilted her head. “Hello.”

It sounded right and wrong at once—her own voice turned inside out, scraped clean of fear.

  

Larry’s voice dropped low behind her. “Princess. Step back.”

  

Mitzy didn’t move.

The copy smiled. “It bends when you breathe,” she said. “When you think too loud. When you try not to feel.”

  

“Who are you?”

  

“You know,” the copy said. “You made me when you needed someone to hate.”

  

Mitzy gripped the spear. “I don’t hate anyone.”

  

The spiral shivered.  The air around her warped; roots pushed through the walls, slick and trembling, weaving a new pattern.

  

The copy’s grin widened. “You hate me,” she said, and her voice thickened with joy. “That’s enough.”

  

“Larry,” Mitzy whispered. “Tell me it’s lying.”

  

“It doesn’t know how,” Larry said. “Only how to echo.”

  

The copy stepped closer. The Maze folded with her, shrinking the space between them. Their spears crossed, tip to tip, metal humming.

  

“Put it down,” Mitzy said.

  

“You first.”

  

They moved at the same time, circling.

Each shift of Mitzy’s feet was mirrored perfectly, the spiral tightening around them until it felt like they were dancing inside a heartbeat.

  

“You’re not real,” Mitzy said again, but the words broke halfway through.

  

“Then why do I bleed when you say that?”

  

The Maze answered before Mitzy could: a low groan, followed by the deep crack of earth splitting.  The spiral tilted, spilling her sideways into her own reflection.

For one heartbeat they were the same—skin against skin, breath matched, anger and fear indistinguishable.

  

Then it was gone.

The other Mitzy dissolved into light that sank through the floor, leaving only her own voice echoing back, thinner now, almost tired.

  

_You needed someone to hate._

  

The floor steadied.  Larry dropped to her shoulder, his weight lighter than usual.

  

“Well,” he said softly, “now it knows your taste.”

  

Mitzy wiped her face with the back of her hand. It came away damp and green. “What does that mean?”

  

“It means,” Larry said, “the Maze has learned a new shape.”

  

She looked down. The walls were breathing again, slow and deep. Each exhale bent the path outward, widening it, as if the Maze were stretching after a long nap.

  

“What shape?”

  

Larry’s voice held something like pity. “Yours.”
---

## Part 5 — The Exit That Isn’t

By the time they found another clearing, the light had turned gray. Ahead lay an archway draped in vines, the closest thing to an exit she’d seen. Beyond it was white light—daylight, maybe.

Mitzy started toward it.

Larry darted in front of her. “Don’t.”

“Why not?”

“Because it’s never that easy.”

She took another step. The air near the arch shimmered. Within it, she saw June again, smiling, hand outstretched. “Come on, Mitz,” said the illusion. “We can go home.”

Mitzy hesitated. “Larry—”

“It’s bait,” he said.

“But what if—”

“Then she’ll still be there after you don’t touch it.”

Mitzy swallowed hard. The longing in June’s voice hurt. “I can’t tell what’s real anymore.”

Larry landed on the spear, his voice low. “That’s the point.”

Mitzy turned away from the arch. As soon as she did, it vanished, leaving only another wall of boxwood.

Larry said nothing. Neither did she.

They walked on until the path faded into darkness.

---

## Part 6 — The First Night

When she finally stopped, she was too tired to cry. She lay on the ground, clutching the Iron Ivy across her chest like a lifeline. The Maze breathed around her, soft and slow.

Larry perched on a branch above. “You did well,” he said quietly.

“I don’t feel like I did.”

“That’s how you know you’re still human.”

She looked up at him, eyes heavy. “Do you ever sleep?”

“Someone has to keep watch.”

“Against what?”

He didn’t answer. Instead, he began to hum—a low, strange melody that seemed to come from the air itself. It wasn’t comforting, exactly, but it was steady, and it filled the spaces where fear might have fit.

Mitzy closed her eyes.

The Maze bent closer, listening.

# Act I — The Maze Awakens

*And as quickly begun, it was finished.  
White magic. My little sister. Gone.*



## Part 2 — Larry's Entrance

The butterfly flexes its wings once, twice. Each flick fans the smell of scorched paper. Its body is velvet-dark, striped faintly with dust. Mitzy goes cross-eyed trying to see it. Its feelers brush her nose and she nearly sneezes.

  

“Hey-ho, princess,” it says.

  

The words tickle through her skin more than her ear. Mitzy flinches backward so hard she smacks the hedge with her shoulder. The leaves prickle—too hot, too sharp. She jerks forward again, hugging her arms to her chest.

  

The butterfly lifts away, fluttering in a careless loop.

  

“Wh-what?” she stammers.

  

“You heard me.” The voice is smoke-thick, too deep for something so small. It circles once and then hovers just above her eye line, wings folding and unfolding as though it is bored already. “Hey-ho, princess.”

  

Mitzy licks her lips. Her tongue tastes of dirt. “I’m… not a princess.”

  

The butterfly dips as if shrugging. “Course you’re not. That’s why it’s funny.”

  

Her heartbeat is trying to dig its way out of her throat. She lifts one hand, palm out, the way she’s seen grownups calm dogs. “Butterflies don’t talk.”

  

The insect yawns—actually yawns—and it sounds like her Uncle Bart hacking through pipe smoke. “Sure we do. Just most of you don’t bother listening.”

  

Mitzy stares. Her mouth wants to say _this is a dream,_ but the hedge-thorns pressing into her shoulder still sting, and the damp dirt still coats her knee. This isn’t dream-soft.

  

The butterfly drifts closer until its antennae are a whisker from her nose. “What’s your name then, Not-a-Princess?”

  

She hugs her arms tighter. “Mitzy.”

  

“Mitzy.” It tastes the word like soup, then coughs. “Hnh. That’ll do. You can call me Larry.”

  

Mitzy blinks. “Larry? That’s not a butterfly name.”

  

“Better than ‘Toots,’” Larry says, and rubs his front legs together with a dry rasp that makes her scalp crawl.

  

Mitzy swats at him. He dodges neatly, laughing as he corkscrews back up into the green light.

  

Her voice comes sharper than she intends: “Why are you talking to me?”

  

Larry hovers, wings twitching. “Because you’re lost, princess. And because you’re about to find something sharp.”

  

Mitzy frowns. “Something sharp?”

  

Larry just grins—if butterflies can grin—and darts toward the corridor’s bend. “Come on. It’s waiting.”

---

## Part 3 — The Iron Ivy

Larry darts ahead, a quick streak of soot against the green.

Mitzy follows because there’s nothing else to follow—the Maze gives only one direction at a time. The air thickens, humid and mint-bitter. When she tries to breathe through her mouth it tastes like pennies and leaves.

  

“Keep up,” Larry calls. “It hates laggers.”

  

“It?” she pants.

  

“The Maze,” he says, like that should be obvious.

  

The corridor bends again, and sunlight leaks through in a single golden stripe, thin as a sword edge.  At its center juts an iron post, half-buried, its head worked with curling vines that mimic the hedges themselves.

  

Mitzy slows.  The metal sweats dew, or maybe something that only looks like it.  Her reflection slides along its dark length—eyes wide, skin ghost-pale, hair full of leaf bits.

  

Larry lands atop it and drums his forelegs. _Ping ping._

“Pretty, huh? Been waiting for you.”

  

Mitzy wipes her palms on her skirt. “For me?”

  

He nods toward the base where the earth splits slightly. “Grab hold.”

  

She hesitates.  The air hums, faint and electric, and the post trembles once as if eager.

  

“Go on,” Larry says, voice suddenly low. “It won’t bite. Yet.”

  

Mitzy wraps both hands around the shaft. The metal is cold enough to burn. She braces one foot, pulls, and the ground gives with a wet pop. The post slides free—a spear, longer than she is tall, ending in a squared ivy-leaf blade dark with age.

  

The weight settles into her arms like it remembers her.

  

Larry whistles. “Well look at that. Princess gets her wand.”

  

“It’s not a wand,” she mutters, testing the balance. The point gleams once in the stripe of sun.  She feels a small thrill—fear’s thinner cousin—run up her spine.

  

“That’s the spirit,” Larry says. “Every maze loves a weapon. Makes the ending tidy.”

  

Mitzy frowns. “What ending?”

  

But he only laughs, a dry fluttering sound that rattles through the hedges.

---

## Part 4 -- The Warning

Mitzy plants the spear in the dirt and leans on it, breath huffing through her teeth. The air here feels heavier, syrup-thick with green. When she glances down, she notices a small placard hanging from the post’s hollow socket—something she hadn’t seen while pulling it free.

  

The sign swings lazily on two rusted chains.  Words are carved into it, not cleanly but gouged, as if by claws or a knife used too many times.  The letters shimmer for a heartbeat, then settle into sense.

  

**YOU HAVE ONE HOUR.**

**DON’T TOUCH THE WALLS.**

  

Mitzy frowns. “One hour for what?”

  

Larry flits closer, his wings clapping faintly in the damp air. “For it to decide what to do with you.”

  

“That’s not funny.”

  

“Wasn’t a joke.”

  

She presses her lips together. The sign creaks once and goes still, as though waiting for her to read it again.

  

“Don’t touch the walls,” she repeats. “What happens if I do?”

  

“Try it and find out,” Larry says, landing lightly on the top edge of the spear. “You’ll learn fast.”

  

Mitzy glares up at him. “You’re awful.”

  

“True,” he says cheerfully. “But useful. Keep me alive and maybe I’ll keep you the same.”

  

She ignores him and stares down the nearest corridor, where the hedges bow toward each other like two tall old ladies whispering. The light beyond them is dimmer, tinged green-black.

  

June’s face swims up in her memory—eyes bright with some secret, cheeks full of crumbs from the last piece of toast. The thought tightens her throat.

  

“I’m coming for you,” she whispers.

  

The Maze answers with a sigh. It could be wind. It could be breathing.

  

Mitzy lifts the spear, sets her shoulders, and steps into the shadowed corridor. The sign behind her twists on its chain and clinks softly, like a clock marking the first second gone.

---

# Chapter 2

# Chapter 2 — Larry’s Bargain
## Part 1 — Larry's Mockery
The path narrowed to a cough of light between walls slick with dew.  Mitzy’s shoes made no sound on the dirt—too soft, like stepping on fur.  Larry drifted ahead, wings whispering, a moving blot in the green gloom.

  

“You’re quiet, Princess,” he called back.  “Thinking’s dangerous here.  The Maze can smell it.”

  

Mitzy tightened her grip on the spear.  “Stop calling me that.”

  

“What—Princess?” he asked, feigning shock.  “You don’t like it?  You seem the type.  You’ve got that whole chin-up thing.  Regal denial.  Classic princess move.”

  

“I’m not one.”

  

“Fine.  Not-a-Princess then.  Rolls off the tongue.  You should get it monogrammed.”

He dipped low enough that his shadow skated across her knuckles.  “Where’s June these days, anyway?  Still stealing your toys?  Still stealing your thunder?”

  

The words struck harder than thorns.  Mitzy kept walking.  “She’s lost,” she said.  “I’m finding her.”

  

Larry snorted, a small explosion of dust.  “Lost, huh.  That’s one way to put it.  Some sisters go missing.  Others get misplaced on purpose.”

  

“Shut up.”

  

He laughed softly.  “Touched a nerve.”

  

“I said shut up!”

  

Her shout hit the hedges like a stone in water.  Ripples ran through the leaves, and the whole corridor shivered.  A faint humming started somewhere deep inside the green, a heartbeat not hers.

  

Larry twirled above her head, pleased.  “See?  The Maze likes honesty.  Don’t worry—it only bites the liars.”

  

Mitzy clenched her jaw until her teeth ached.  “You don’t know anything about me.”

  

“Know enough,” he said, and suddenly he wasn’t joking.  “You think being the big sister makes you the hero.  It doesn’t.  It just gives you the sharper knife.”

  

She stopped walking.  “What did you say?”

  

Larry landed on a branch at eye level, wings closing like two black hands.  “Don’t look at me like that.  I’m just repeating what it tells me.”

  

“The Maze?”

  

He nodded.  “It remembers things.  Little things.  Who tripped who.  Who whispered what.  Who wished the other would just… disappear.”

  

Mitzy’s stomach turned cold.  “That’s a lie.”

  

“Then the Maze won’t mind hearing it again.”

  

He fluttered higher, out of reach.  “Come on, Princess-Not.  Keep up.  The walls move faster when you sulk.”


## Part 3 — The Walls Respond

The corridor kept narrowing until Mitzy could feel the brush of leaves against her sleeves.  They whispered when she moved—tiny wet sounds, like lips tasting rain.

She tried to ignore it, but the hedges were breathing again.  She could _hear_ the rhythm if she matched her steps to it.

  

Breathe in.

Step.

Breathe out.

Step.

  

A leaf grazed her wrist and left a damp mark, the shape of a hand too small to be her own.

  

“Larry,” she called.  Her voice sounded thick, stuck in syrup.

No answer—just the faint clatter of wings somewhere ahead.

  

The spear weighed heavier now.  When she shifted it to her other hand, the ground beneath her feet rippled again, faint but deliberate.  The Maze was awake.

  

She stopped.  “I said—Larry!”

  

The whispering hushed.  A moment later, a thousand whispers answered all at once.  Her name again, layered and folding:

_Mitzy.  Mitzy.  Mitzy._

  

Each echo leaned closer until she couldn’t tell where they were coming from—above, behind, inside her.  The sound pressed against her skin like invisible hands.

She swung the spear in front of her, slicing air.  The voices broke into laughter.

  

“Not funny!” she yelled.

  

“Oh, I think it’s hilarious,” said Larry, gliding back from the dark.  His voice carried a grin she could hear.  “You’re finally in conversation with the place.”

  

Mitzy glared at him.  “Make it stop.”

  

“Can’t.  You started it.”

  

“What did I do?”

  

“You thought too loud.”

  

“That’s stupid.”

  

“Yep.”  Larry perched on a branch and folded his wings.  “Welcome to stupid country.”

  

The laughter of the Maze thinned to a giggle, then to breathing again.  Mitzy’s shoulders loosened, just barely.

  

“It talks like you,” she said.

  

Larry preened.  “Maybe I talk like it.”

  

She stared at him.  “That supposed to help?”

  

“Not particularly.”

  

Mitzy rolled her eyes, though the motion felt brittle.  “You’re the worst guide ever.”

  

“Funny thing about that,” Larry said.  “Guides don’t have to like where they’re going.”

  

He nodded ahead.  “Come on, Princess.  The Maze won’t wait forever.  And neither will the Goblin.”

  

Mitzy tightened her grip on the spear and stepped after him, but now every leaf she brushed against whispered her name as she passed, slow and pleased.

  

_Mitzy.  Mitzy.  Mitzy._

  

Each repetition sounded a little more like June.

---

## Part 4 — The Bargain Struck

The tunnel widened again without warning, opening into a shallow bowl of light.  Vines hung like ribs from the hedges, dripping pale sap that smoked when it hit the ground.  The smell was sugar and rust.

  

Larry coasted down until he floated just in front of her face.  “Breathe easy, Princess.  This is a rest stop.”

  

“I don’t need to rest.”

  

“Everyone needs to rest.  Some just don’t wake up afterward.”  He grinned.  “Kidding.  Mostly.”

  

Mitzy planted the spear in the dirt and sat.  The earth was warm.  She wiped sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand.  “You said there’s a Goblin.”

  

“There’s always a Goblin,” Larry said.  “Maze’s way of giving people something to blame.”

  

“What is it?”

  

“Depends who you ask.  Sometimes it’s teeth.  Sometimes it’s regret with claws.”

  

Mitzy frowned.  “You’re not helping.”

  

“I’m trying,” he said, tone softening for the first time.  “The Maze keeps its monsters custom-made.  But the rules stay simple:  find it, kill it, and maybe—_maybe_—you walk out with your heart still where you left it.”

  

“And June?”

  

“Ah, June.”  Larry’s wings beat once, stirring the sweet air.  “She’s in here somewhere.  Or something wearing her shape is.  Either way, you’ll meet her at the end.”

  

Mitzy’s throat tightened.  “How do you know?”

  

“Because the Maze told me.”

  

“That’s a lie.”

  

He tilted his head.  “Then we’ll find out which of us it likes better.”

  

She looked down at the spear.  The ivy carved along its length seemed to pulse, faintly breathing with her.  “If I find the Goblin and kill it, June goes home?”

  

Larry nodded.  “That’s the bargain.”

  

“And if I don’t?”

  

“Then you stay.  Maze needs someone to keep the candles lit.”

  

Mitzy rose.  “Fine.”  She lifted the spear.  “I’ll find it.”

  

Larry laughed, quiet and pleased.  “Good girl.”

  

“Don’t call me that.”

  

“Fine.  Good killer.”

  

She glared.  “Shut up.”

  

But he only twirled upward into the canopy, black wings slicing the light.  “Clock’s ticking, Princess-Not.  Let’s go earn that hour.”

  

The whisper came again from the hedges as she stepped forward:

_Mitzy.  Mitzy.  Mitzy._

Now it sounded almost like applause.

---

# Chapter 3

# Chapter 3 — The First Bending
## Part 1 — Circles

_Echo:_ _Mitzy. Mitzy. Mitzy._ The whisper followed like polite clapping that wouldn’t stop.

  

The sound rode her shoulders as she walked, soft as moth wings, patient as rain. Larry drifted ahead, a soot-flake that refused to land. The corridor looked ordinary at first—dirt floor, boxwood walls sweating green—but the ordinary kept rearranging itself when she blinked, like a picture someone couldn’t decide how to hang.

  

Mitzy stepped over a fallen twig with a split end like a snake’s tongue. Ten paces later she stepped over the same twig again. She recognized the muddy crescent of her own boot print beside it, already drying at the edges.

  

“Larry,” she said.

  

“Mmm?” He didn’t look back.

  

“We were here.”

  

“Every minute,” he said lightly. “You’re just catching up.”

  

She scowled at his back and kept going. Left bend, short straight, shallow dip where the dirt held a darker seam. She counted—one, two, three—turned right, and met the twig for the third time. The Maze pretended it had never seen her before, and the pretence made her teeth ache.

  

“Stop it,” she told the path.

  

It stopped. That is, it paused just long enough for her to wonder if stopping meant winning, and then it offered the same shallow dip with a little extra tilt, as if the Maze had cocked its head.

  

Mitzy set the butt of the spear on the ground, hard. The shock went up her arms the way laughter sometimes does when you’re not supposed to laugh. Birds were singing far above, the same tune as before, but the notes fell in a new order, and that made the song feel wrong.

  

“Tell me it’s a trick,” she said. “Say there’s a mirror. A loop. Say something that makes sense.”

  

Larry angled back toward her in a lazy figure-eight. “All mazes are loops. This one just likes to brag about it.”

  

“That isn’t helpful.”

  

“Helps me,” he said.

  

Mitzy crouched and touched the mud. Her earlier boot print fit her toes like a mold. A line dragged through the dirt nearby—long, shallow, a mark she didn’t remember making. She traced it to a scuffed place where something heavy had turned. For a breath she could see it: a girl her size pulling an iron post from the ground, the blade kissing air, the weight dragging a scar.

  

“Was that me?” she whispered.

  

Larry hovered lower until his shadow crowned her head. “If you don’t like the answer, pick a better question.”

  

She stood. The corridor ahead was the same corridor ahead. She hated it for acting clever. “Fine,” she said to the hedge. “Let’s see how clever.”

  

She took the left bend and kept her eyes on the seam where wall met floor. She counted the breaths between the birds’ falling notes. She dragged the spearpoint just enough to leave a bright line along the dirt—thin, shining, proof. At the shallow dip she tilted the blade and carved an X. When the path turned right, she didn’t. She pushed into the leaves instead, not touching—she remembered the sign—but close enough to feel their cold breath on her arms.

  

The hedge hissed, offended. She eased back onto the corridor before it could decide what to do about her. Ten paces. The twig. The boot print. The X she carved, waiting like a smirk.

  

Mitzy’s throat tightened. “No.”

  

The Maze purred. It wasn’t a sound so much as a pleased loosening under her feet, as if the ground had smiled.

  

Larry clicked his tongue. “Princess-Not, meet your own orbit. Your orbit, meet the Princess.”

  

“I’m not orbiting,” she said, but the word came out thinner than she wanted. She set off again, faster. The corridor obliged, unspooling like ribbon, happy to be chased.

  

Left bend, dip, right bend, twig, X. Left bend, dip, right bend, twig, X. Mitzy’s breath came faster. The hedges leaned in like old women eager for gossip. She tried a new game—backwards steps, eyes closed for three heartbeats, point the spear at the exact center of her sternum and pivot left on the heel. When she opened her eyes, the twig waited, tongue split and laughing.

  

“Larry.” It was a warning this time, and a plea.

  

He gave a small, approving hum. “Now you’re speaking its language.”

  

“I’m speaking _angry_.”

  

“Same dialect.”

  

Mitzy planted the spear, chest heaving. The applause-whisper of her name had thinned to a steady murmur, the way a crowd sounds when it thinks you’re about to perform.

  

She looked up. The coin of sky still hung there, pale and careless. Something about that calm edge above made the corridor’s sameness feel like mockery.

  

“I’m not your joke,” she said to the Maze. “Find someone else.”

  

The leaves rustled, pleased that she’d said anything at all. The path ahead brightened by a hair, as if the Maze had leaned back to get a better look at her.

  

Mitzy wiped her palms on her skirt and set the spear across her shoulders, the way she’d seen men carry tools when they wanted to show they weren’t tired. She took one more step and felt the unseen circle tilt underfoot, just slightly, like a plate being slid from a table without the glasses falling.

  

“Did you feel that?” she asked.

  

Larry’s wings slowed, the air around him quivering like heat over stone. “Oh, it felt you,” he said. “Keep going.”

  

Mitzy did. The twig stayed where it was. The X did not. Somewhere between one breath and the next, the X had gone faint, as if the Maze were swallowing the line she’d drawn into its tongue.

  

She swallowed too, because her mouth had gone dry. “If I’m the loop, then I can unloop.”

  

“That’s the spirit,” Larry said. “All you have to do is stop being you.”

  

Mitzy stared at the bend that waited like a suggestion. “How hard can that be,” she said, and took it.



## Part 3 — The Spiral

The spiral coiled ahead like a shell turned inside out.

Its walls were smoother than before—no leaves now, only glistening skin the color of new moss. Light pulsed under the surface, a rhythm that didn’t match her heartbeat but wanted to.

  

Mitzy stepped onto the slope. The air was thicker here, heavier, as if she’d walked underwater without noticing. Each breath tasted like mint and copper.

  

Larry followed, wings brushing her cheek. “Slow down. Mazes hate impatience.”

  

“I want out.”

  

“Everyone does. It’s what keeps them walking.”

  

Mitzy took another step. The floor flexed beneath her boots, soft as wet paper. She lifted her foot and saw the faint print it left behind glowing briefly before fading. She imagined she could hear the Maze sigh in satisfaction, like it had been waiting for her to leave her mark.

  

The tunnel tightened. She had to angle the spear sideways to keep moving.

Something about the curve made her dizzy; it wasn’t just turning downward—it was turning **around her**, folding her in its geometry.

She felt the world bend and realized it wasn’t just the path. It was her.

  

Her thoughts kept doubling back. Every time she tried to picture June’s face, it slipped into her own.

The two faces twisted together until she couldn’t tell whose memory she was holding.

She stopped walking and pressed her forehead against the spear’s cold shaft.

  

“Larry,” she whispered. “I can’t remember her voice.”

  

He hovered in front of her, wings flickering faint blue in the half-light.

“Memory’s just another wall, Princess. Push too hard and you flatten what’s behind it.”

  

“But if I forget her—”

  

“You won’t,” he said, and for once the sarcasm fell away. “The Maze remembers for you.”

  

She looked up. “That’s supposed to help?”

  

“No,” he said. “It’s supposed to scare you into walking.”

  

Mitzy kept moving. The spiral steepened, each curve tighter than the last.

The glow under the floor thickened to a heartbeat, slow and patient.

It felt like walking across the inside of a giant lung. The air moved with her steps.

  

At the curve’s next turn, she saw motion ahead—her own silhouette, seconds delayed, rounding the bend before her.

  

“Larry?”

  

“Yes, Princess.”

  

“Is that… me?”

  

The butterfly tilted. “Depends which of you asks first.”

  

Her shadow turned to face her.

Mitzy froze.

  

The shape smiled—a thin, knowing grin she didn’t recognize—and mouthed something she couldn’t hear.

  

The walls leaned closer, eager to listen.

  

Mitzy’s spear trembled in her hands. “It’s saying something.”

  

“Don’t answer,” Larry said quickly.

  

But she already had.

  

“I can’t hear you,” Mitzy whispered.

  

Her shadow blinked, and its eyes opened into light.

---

## Part 4 — The Lesson

Her shadow blinked again, light pouring from the sockets like water through cracks.

The glow sloshed across the spiral walls, staining them bright green, until Mitzy could see herself—_herself_—standing just ahead, as solid as breath in cold air.

  

Same clothes. Same spear. Same dirt smudge on the chin.

But the other girl’s eyes glowed steady where Mitzy’s trembled.

  

“Hello?” Mitzy managed.

  

The copy tilted her head. “Hello.”

It sounded right and wrong at once—her own voice turned inside out, scraped clean of fear.

  

Larry’s voice dropped low behind her. “Princess. Step back.”

  

Mitzy didn’t move.

The copy smiled. “It bends when you breathe,” she said. “When you think too loud. When you try not to feel.”

  

“Who are you?”

  

“You know,” the copy said. “You made me when you needed someone to hate.”

  

Mitzy gripped the spear. “I don’t hate anyone.”

  

The spiral shivered.  The air around her warped; roots pushed through the walls, slick and trembling, weaving a new pattern.

  

The copy’s grin widened. “You hate me,” she said, and her voice thickened with joy. “That’s enough.”

  

“Larry,” Mitzy whispered. “Tell me it’s lying.”

  

“It doesn’t know how,” Larry said. “Only how to echo.”

  

The copy stepped closer. The Maze folded with her, shrinking the space between them. Their spears crossed, tip to tip, metal humming.

  

“Put it down,” Mitzy said.

  

“You first.”

  

They moved at the same time, circling.

Each shift of Mitzy’s feet was mirrored perfectly, the spiral tightening around them until it felt like they were dancing inside a heartbeat.

  

“You’re not real,” Mitzy said again, but the words broke halfway through.

  

“Then why do I bleed when you say that?”

  

The Maze answered before Mitzy could: a low groan, followed by the deep crack of earth splitting.  The spiral tilted, spilling her sideways into her own reflection.

For one heartbeat they were the same—skin against skin, breath matched, anger and fear indistinguishable.

  

Then it was gone.

The other Mitzy dissolved into light that sank through the floor, leaving only her own voice echoing back, thinner now, almost tired.

  

_You needed someone to hate._

  

The floor steadied.  Larry dropped to her shoulder, his weight lighter than usual.

  

“Well,” he said softly, “now it knows your taste.”

  

Mitzy wiped her face with the back of her hand. It came away damp and green. “What does that mean?”

  

“It means,” Larry said, “the Maze has learned a new shape.”

  

She looked down. The walls were breathing again, slow and deep. Each exhale bent the path outward, widening it, as if the Maze were stretching after a long nap.

  

“What shape?”

  

Larry’s voice held something like pity. “Yours.”
---

## Part 5 — The Exit That Isn’t

By the time they found another clearing, the light had turned gray. Ahead lay an archway draped in vines, the closest thing to an exit she’d seen. Beyond it was white light—daylight, maybe.

Mitzy started toward it.

Larry darted in front of her. “Don’t.”

“Why not?”

“Because it’s never that easy.”

She took another step. The air near the arch shimmered. Within it, she saw June again, smiling, hand outstretched. “Come on, Mitz,” said the illusion. “We can go home.”

Mitzy hesitated. “Larry—”

“It’s bait,” he said.

“But what if—”

“Then she’ll still be there after you don’t touch it.”

Mitzy swallowed hard. The longing in June’s voice hurt. “I can’t tell what’s real anymore.”

Larry landed on the spear, his voice low. “That’s the point.”

Mitzy turned away from the arch. As soon as she did, it vanished, leaving only another wall of boxwood.

Larry said nothing. Neither did she.

They walked on until the path faded into darkness.

---

## Part 6 — The First Night

When she finally stopped, she was too tired to cry. She lay on the ground, clutching the Iron Ivy across her chest like a lifeline. The Maze breathed around her, soft and slow.

Larry perched on a branch above. “You did well,” he said quietly.

“I don’t feel like I did.”

“That’s how you know you’re still human.”

She looked up at him, eyes heavy. “Do you ever sleep?”

“Someone has to keep watch.”

“Against what?”

He didn’t answer. Instead, he began to hum—a low, strange melody that seemed to come from the air itself. It wasn’t comforting, exactly, but it was steady, and it filled the spaces where fear might have fit.

Mitzy closed her eyes.

The Maze bent closer, listening.

# Chapter 4

# Act II — Mirrors and Memory

# Chapter 4 — The Garden of Mirrors
## Part 1 — The Clearing

“The next mistake,” Larry said.

  

The words followed them around the bend and into light. The corridor loosened, hedges sighing apart until the Maze opened its mouth wider than before. Mitzy stepped through first, spear balanced against her shoulder, and the air changed—cooler, rinsed clean, full of a brittle shine that made her eyes ache.

  

Leaves tiled the clearing like scales, thousands of them, each one slick and bright enough to catch a face. Sun broke through in narrow blades and scattered across the ivy, turning the whole place into a bowl of green glass. When she moved, a hundred Mitzys moved with her, small and uncertain and armed.

  

“Don’t touch,” Larry said, settling to hover at her cheek. “It’s hungry for fingerprints.”

  

Mitzy swallowed. “They’re just leaves.”

  

“Everything’s ‘just’ something,” he murmured. “Until it isn’t.”

  

She edged forward. The earth underfoot felt tight and springy, like a drumhead. Her reflections came closer—eyes too wide, mouth too thin, a smear of dirt at her jaw she could not wipe off because it lived in the leaf, not on her skin. She raised the spear a little and every Mitzy lifted hers, a forest of points aimed at a girl in the middle.

  

“Stop that,” she told herself, and the copies froze mid-breath, as if waiting to find out who got to be the real one.

  

Larry drifted higher, his shadow hopping from leaf to leaf. “This is where the Maze checks your homework.”

  

“I didn’t bring any,” she said, but softly, because the clearing felt like a church that had forgotten what it worshipped.

  

The nearest leaves shivered. Faces blurred, sharpened. One Mitzy looked older—chin up, eyes cold. Another smaller—baby fat in the cheeks, a milk tooth missing. A third turned her head in a way Mitzy hadn’t moved yet and smiled a mean little smile she didn’t recognize as hers.

  

Mitzy’s hands went damp on the shaft of the spear. “Make it stop.”

  

“You make it,” Larry said. “It only shows what you bring.”

  

She shifted her weight. The drumhead ground gave a mild complaint, a low creak like a door thinking about opening. She glanced down. Between the ivy’s glossy panes, the dark soil winked—then closed again as the leaves overlapped, careful and neat, hiding whatever looked back from underneath.

  

“June?” Mitzy tried, just to see. Her voice broke into the shine and scattered. A small face flickered on a dozen leaves at once—round, quick, gone.

  

She took a breath that felt too sharp for her lungs. “I saw her.”

  

“Did you?” Larry asked. “Or did she see you?”

  

Mitzy didn’t answer. She stepped into the center of the clearing where the light was brightest, turned slowly, and watched the crowded girl she was, had been, might be, gather itself around her like a ring of witnesses. The spear’s tip nudged a leaf; her reflection’s point met it from the other side with a tiny, perfect kiss. The sound it made was not metal on glass but something wetter, nearer to bone.

  

“Don’t,” Larry said again, but less sure this time.

  

Mitzy kept turning until the reflections doubled and the doubleness made her dizzy. Somewhere in that spinning, one of the Mitzys tilted her head like a question and lagged a heartbeat out of time.

  

Mitzy stopped. So did they. The late one didn’t. She kept smiling that not-quite-her smile and lifted her spear a fraction higher than all the rest.




## Part 3 — Shattering

Mitzy swung.

The spear cut a bright arc through the clearing, slicing light instead of air. For one clean heartbeat nothing happened—then every leaf screamed.

Not loud. Not noise. More like glass remembering it used to be sand.

The reflection nearest her burst first: colors folded inward, a mouth swallowing itself. The next followed, then another, until the whole glade shattered in ripples, each leaf turning from mirror to something wet and red-brown at the edges.

Mitzy stumbled back, the spear still humming. The smell hit next—green sap and iron, like the time she’d skinned her knee and cried because June hadn’t.

Larry hovered just beyond the wreckage, his wings slow and deliberate. “Feel better?” he asked.

“No.”

“Then why does the Maze?”

She looked around. The clearing had changed shape. The walls stood straighter now, breathing easier. The crushed leaves on the ground pulsed faintly, drinking up the light that leaked through the canopy.

“It wanted you to do that,” Larry said. “You fed it a memory. First taste is always the hardest.”

Mitzy wiped her mouth with the back of her hand. “They were me.”

“Bits of you. Echoes. Every Maze keeps souvenirs.”

“I heard them talk,” she said. “They knew things I never said.”

Larry gave a soft, humorless laugh. “Everybody’s thoughts are loud in here. You’re lucky it hasn’t started singing them back.”

She tightened her grip on the spear. “It’s not true. I never wanted her gone.”

The butterfly tilted in the air, half smile, half shadow. “Good. Keep saying it. The Maze loves a good denial—builds whole wings out of them.”

Mitzy’s knees gave a small, traitorous shake. She jabbed the spear butt into the dirt to steady herself. “What now?”

“Now?” Larry said. “You walk before the glass grows back. Or it’ll start making new faces to fill the cracks.”

She hesitated at the edge of the ruined clearing, eyes on the shards that used to be leaves. They reflected nothing anymore—just dark, wet soil below. Somewhere in that dark, a faint giggle rose and fell.

Mitzy didn’t wait to hear if it was hers.

She ran.

---

## Part 4 — Exit

The path ahead had no edges anymore—just a faint seam of trampled leaves guiding her out. Behind, the clearing stitched itself shut, vines twisting over the ruin with a slow, greedy sound. The mirrored leaves re-formed as she watched, already smoothing their surfaces, already learning a better way to reflect.

Larry glided beside her, quiet for once. His wings made small, exhausted sighs.

“Did I break it?” Mitzy asked.

“Nothing breaks here,” he said. “It only remembers what broke you.”

The spear felt heavier. Sap dried on the blade, leaving a dull, dark bloom. She wiped it on her skirt and the cloth came away streaked green and brown. Her stomach turned.

“I didn’t mean—”

“Sure you did.” Larry’s tone wasn’t cruel; it was simply matter-of-fact. “That’s what makes it work.”

They walked until the light changed from bright sick-green to dim gold. The air cooled. The hum in the walls faded to the slow heartbeat of something sated.

Mitzy stopped and looked back one last time. The clearing was gone—only a ripple of darker hedge where it had been. For a moment she thought she saw faces again, small and pale, pressed into the leaves like fossils. When she blinked, they were gone.

Larry brushed her ear with a wingtip. “Next time, Princess, maybe try talking to yourself before you start stabbing.”

“I didn’t stab me,” she said.

“Of course not,” he said softly. “You never do.”

She glared at him, but he had already risen toward the canopy, a black spark vanishing into gold light.

Mitzy turned forward. The corridor ahead bent in three directions at once. She chose the middle because it looked least certain and began to walk, the Maze whispering faintly after her, each syllable trying out her name in a different voice.

Mitzy. Mitzy. Mitzy.

---

# Chapter 5

# Chapter 5 — The Sister’s Room
## Part 1 — The Door That Shouldn't Be

The corridor pinched, then widened again so suddenly that Mitzy had to blink against the light.

It wasn’t green this time. It was _yellow_ — pale, dusty, the colour of late afternoon coming through curtains.

  

The air smelled wrong for the Maze: detergent, soap bubbles, the faint sugar of oatmeal cookies burned around the edges.

She stopped walking.

  

Ahead, the hedges flattened into a wall not of leaves but of painted wood — white, with a doorknob shaped like a glass marble she half-remembered from somewhere that used to be safe.

  

Larry perched on her shoulder. “Oh,” he said quietly. “That trick again.”

  

Mitzy’s throat closed around the words. “That’s— That’s _my house._”

  

“Is it?” Larry asked. “Or does the Maze just like your taste in décor?”

  

She reached for the knob before she could think better of it. The glass marble under her fingers was cool and solid. When she turned it, the door swung inward on the smell of dust and the sound of wind chimes that shouldn’t exist in a hedge.

  

Inside was her room.

Not a copy. Not a memory. _Her_ room.

Pink lamp shade. Crooked poster. The stuffed rabbit with the missing ear sitting exactly where she’d left it two summers ago.

Even the crack in the windowpane had the same spider-shape she’d traced a hundred times when she couldn’t sleep.

  

Mitzy stood in the doorway, heart hammering. “This isn’t real.”

  

Larry stayed in the threshold, wings folded. “That depends who you ask. Memory’s the Maze’s favorite building material.”

  

The rabbit fell over by itself.



## Part 3 — The Voice in the Closet

Mitzy froze.

The voice wasn’t exactly June’s—it was thinner, hollowed out, as if spoken through a seashell.

Her fingers tightened on the spear shaft until her knuckles ached.

  

“I didn’t,” she said. “You ran. I tried to—”

  

“You didn’t look,” the voice interrupted, still soft, but close enough that it vibrated through the air.

The hanging clothes swayed gently, brushing against one another like leaves in a windless forest.

  

Mitzy took a step closer. The scent of strawberry shampoo hit harder now, layered with something else: damp earth, the smell of the Maze beneath all the soap and memory.

She pushed one sleeve aside. Then another. The closet’s dark deepened.

  

“June?”

  

“Why did you wish it?”

  

Mitzy’s mouth went dry. “Wish what?”

  

“To be alone.”

  

“I didn’t.”

  

“You did,” the voice said. “You said it under your breath, the night I broke your toy horse. You said you wished I’d never—”

  

“Shut up!” Mitzy yelled, thrusting the spear into the closet.

  

The metal hit nothing at first, then caught on something soft.  A sound like exhaling.  The darkness folded inward.

All at once the closet emptied—no clothes, no air, no voice—just a long hollow that smelled like turned soil.

  

Mitzy staggered back, heart pounding.

Behind her, Larry said, very quietly, “You’re not supposed to answer it, Princess. The Maze loves when you answer.”

  

“I didn’t know what else to do.”

  

“Not knowing is safer.”

  

The rabbit rolled across the floor and stopped at her boot, its one glass eye staring up at her.

Mitzy looked down. The fur around its mouth was wet.

  

She wanted to ask what that meant, but Larry had turned away. He was watching the window.

Beyond the glass, the world had changed: no sky now, just hedge pressing against the pane, leaves flat and glistening like skin.

  

Mitzy whispered, “Where’s the door?”

  

Larry didn’t look back. “It left when you came in.”

  

The bed creaked.

Mitzy turned, slowly.

  

Someone was sitting there—small, cross-legged, hair tangled, head bowed.

  

It was June. Or something wearing her face.

---

## Part 4 — The False Sister

June raised her head.

Her eyes were wrong.

Not in color—they were the same gray-green—but in how still they were.  June’s eyes had always darted, hungry for what came next.  These didn’t blink at all.

  

“Hi, Mitzy,” she said.  The voice came clean and warm, exactly as it should, except for the small gap between each word—as if something else had to translate before speaking.

“I missed you.”

  

Mitzy’s throat squeezed tight. “June?”

  

The girl on the bed smiled.  “Don’t sound so surprised.  You came back for me.”

She swung her feet once, the heels tapping the bedframe like a ticking clock.

  

Mitzy’s eyes darted to the spear resting against her leg.  “You’re not real.”

  

June’s smile thinned.  “Neither are you, not anymore.  You’ve been gone a long time.”

  

“I was looking,” Mitzy said.

  

“For me?  Or for what you lost?”

  

Mitzy took a step back.  “Stop it.”

  

Larry flitted between them, circling the false June in cautious loops.  “Careful, Princess.  Some reflections climb out of their mirrors.”

  

June’s gaze snapped toward him.  “You talk too much.”

The air crackled.  Larry dropped half an inch, wings stuttering.  He managed a small laugh, but it was thin.  “Oh, she’s learning tricks now.  That’s adorable.”

  

Mitzy couldn’t look away from her sister.

June looked the same in every detail, down to the chipped nail polish, but the air around her pulsed faintly—as if she were being projected through water.

  

“Why are you here?” Mitzy asked.

  

June tilted her head.  “You brought me.  You always bring me.  The Maze just holds the door.”

She leaned forward, voice dropping low.  “I remember what you said that night.”

  

Mitzy’s stomach flipped.  “No.”

  

“You told Mom it was my fault you lost the rabbit.  That you hated me.  That you wished I’d—”

  

“Stop!”

  

June’s body blurred, flickering between ages—the wide-eyed toddler, the tooth-gap child, the sullen shadow she’d grown into.  “Why?  You like stories.  This one’s yours.”

  

Mitzy lunged forward and grabbed her by the shoulders.  Her hands met something cold and slick.  The shape collapsed under her fingers like melting wax, leaving only the smell of earth and strawberry shampoo.

  

Larry darted close, pulling her back by the hem of her shirt.  “Lesson learned, Princess-Not?”

  

Mitzy stared at the empty bed.  The blanket was wet, dark with a stain that hadn’t been there a heartbeat ago.

Her voice came out thin.  “She’s gone again.”

  

Larry’s tone was almost gentle.  “For now.  But ghosts travel fast here.”

  

Mitzy turned to the window.  The hedge pressed closer against the glass, and in its surface, a single reflection watched her—June’s face, smiling from inside the leaves.



---

# Chapter 6

# Chapter 6 — The Chorus of Sisters
## Part 1 — Whispers in the Hedges

Mitzy left the room and didn’t look back.

There was no door anymore, only hedge—fresh, new, and wet-looking, as though the Maze had just grown over her memory to keep it warm.

The path ahead stretched in two directions that couldn’t possibly meet.  She picked one because it felt less sure of itself.

  

Larry floated ahead of her again, small, dark, quiet.  His silence felt heavier than his jokes ever had.

  

The corridor wound downward, the ground turning spongy.  The smell of dirt thickened, and the walls began to hum—a faint, tuneless vibration, like someone singing through a wall in another house.

  

Mitzy slowed.  “What’s that?”

  

Larry tilted his wings, listening.  “The Maze humming to itself.”

  

“It knows songs?”

  

“Only the ones it’s eaten.”

  

The humming grew louder as they walked.  Not one voice—hundreds.  Whispers running under one another until the words tangled.  At first she thought it was leaves moving in wind, but there was no wind here, and some of the whispers sounded like laughter, some like crying, some like hers.

  

She stopped.  “Larry… what is it?”

  

He didn’t answer right away.  Then, “The alumni association.”

  

She frowned.  “What’s that?”

  

“All the ones who came before.  The Maze doesn’t let good material go to waste.”

  

The whispers shifted as if hearing him.  A few rose above the rest, brief and desperate:

_“Find her.”_

_“Don’t turn around.”_

_“He’s still hungry.”_

  

Mitzy pressed her hands to her ears.  The sound didn’t stop.  It pressed through skin, humming behind her teeth.

  

“I can’t—make them—stop!”

  

“Can’t stop a choir, Princess,” Larry said.  “Best you can do is change the tune.”

  

“How?”

  

“Walk louder.”

  

She started forward, faster.  The voices swelled with her steps, harmonizing, matching her rhythm like a heartbeat under her own.  Some sounded her age.  Some sounded like mothers.  Some were no age at all.

  

When she passed a gap in the hedge, she caught glimpses between the leaves—shapes like faces, pale and still, lips moving in unison.  Eyes closed.  Or gone.

  

One of them looked almost like her.

  

Mitzy stumbled.  “Larry, they—”

  

“Keep walking.”

  

“I think they know me.”

  

“They _are_ you,” he said softly.  “Or close enough for the Maze to confuse the difference.”

  

The whisper nearest her ear sighed her name in chorus—_Mitzy-Mitzy-Mitzy_—each syllable overlapping the next until it turned into breathing again.

  

She didn’t run this time.  She just kept moving, slower, careful, eyes on Larry’s flicker of black ahead of her.



## Part 3 — The Relic

The ground levelled into a hollow slick with rainwater that had never seen sky.  The reflection on its surface was pale and wrong, a picture of leaves bending the wrong direction.

  

Mitzy stepped around it carefully.  Her boot touched something hard just beneath the skin of mud.  She crouched, scraping at it with her fingertips until she uncovered a shape.

  

A small, iron pendant.

Twisted into the rough outline of two girls hand-in-hand.

  

She wiped it clean on her sleeve. The iron smelled faintly of salt and old blood.

The figures’ faces were gone, worn flat.

But around the edge someone had carved words small as pin scratches:

**WE WALK TOGETHER UNTIL ONE STOPS.**

  

Larry drifted low, his wings stirring the puddle into circles.

“Souvenir?”

  

“It’s theirs,” she said.

  

“Yours now.”

  

Mitzy shook her head. “It feels… wrong.”

  

“Everything worth keeping does,” Larry said. “That’s how the Maze remembers who tried.”

  

She looked closer at the pendant.

A faint red shimmer pulsed through the grooves of the metal, fading in and out with her heartbeat.  When she turned it over, the back bore a second phrase:

**GOBLIN’S MARK.**

  

Her stomach dropped. “Larry… this isn’t just a trinket.”

  

He didn’t answer at first.  Then he said, “No.  It’s a contract.”

  

“A what?”

  

“Some sisters made deals.  Some didn’t.  Guess which kind still have voices.”

  

Mitzy held the pendant at arm’s length. “It belongs to one of them. I can’t keep it.”

  

“Sure you can.  You picked it up.”

  

“I don’t want it.”

  

“You think that matters?”

  

The puddle at her feet quivered.  A single bubble rose and popped.

For a moment, beneath the surface, she saw another hand—smaller than hers, reaching toward the pendant with a motion exactly matching her own.

  

She flung it down.

The pendant sank soundlessly into the water, the light dying with it.

  

Larry sighed.  “That was unwise.”

  

“Why?”

  

“Now it knows your name.”

  

The puddle darkened until it was just shadow.  From its center came a murmur, thin and low:

_Mitzy…_

  

Larry’s voice sharpened.  “Walk away.”

  

She ran.  The whisper followed, a ripple that moved under the path itself, echoing each of her footsteps like a heartbeat chasing her own.

---

## Part 4 — The Names in the Dark

The path dipped again, swallowing what little light the Maze pretended to have.

Mitzy’s breath came shallow, clouding the air in front of her even though it wasn’t cold.  The darkness had weight here.  Each step pressed through it like wading into tar.

  

Behind her, the puddle’s voice faded, but new ones rose to replace it.

Not whispers this time—**names**, spoken in careful rhythm, one after another.

She recognized none of them at first.  Then one hit her gut like a stone.

  

“June.”

  

Mitzy stopped dead.

  

The air hummed; the walls glowed faintly with veins of green light running under the leaves.  In that light, the roots and branches weren’t roots or branches anymore but **arms**, hundreds of them, reaching from inside the Maze.

Each hand held a pendant like the one she’d found.  Each pendant pulsed red, the rhythm steady, heartbeat slow and patient.

  

Larry came to rest on her shoulder.  “Don’t listen.”

  

“She said my sister’s name.”

  

“They all do eventually.”

  

“But—what if she’s—”

  

“She’s not.”

  

He said it quickly. Too quickly.

  

The arms stirred.  Some reached higher, their fingers curling in invitation.

Mitzy stepped back, but the whisper followed, breaking from the unison into overlapping pleas.

  

_Don’t stop._

_We walked too far._

_He’s still hungry._

_Finish what we couldn’t._

  

Larry hissed.  “Keep walking, Princess.  The dead get chatty when they smell company.”

  

Mitzy took one step backward.  The ground flexed.  Hands burst from the soil around her boots, thin and bark-skinned, clutching at her ankles.  She gasped and struck down with the spear.

The blade cut through one wrist.  Sap—no, blood—splattered warm against her shins.

  

The severed hand clung to the spear for a heartbeat longer before dropping.  The voice that had said _June_ screamed once and went silent.

  

Larry’s tone dropped to a near whisper.  “Now they know you bite.”

  

Mitzy trembled.  “They’re trying to pull me down.”

  

“They’re trying to make you stay.  That’s how they sing.”

  

The arms sank again, the last few brushing against her knees like reluctant children before disappearing into the soil.  The red light faded, leaving her and Larry alone with the dark again.

  

Mitzy wiped the spear tip clean on the hem of her skirt.  The smear glowed faintly for a moment, then dimmed.

  

“Larry?” she whispered.

  

“Yes, Princess?”

  

“Are they… gone?”

  

He hovered close, voice smaller than she’d ever heard it.  “No.  They’re just waiting for the refrain.”

# Chapter 7

# Act III — The Feast

# Chapter 7 — The Feast of the Goblin
## Part 1 — The Scent of Smoke

The air changed before the path did.

It grew heavy with sweetness, the kind that clings to the back of your throat until you can’t tell if you’re breathing or swallowing it. The green smell of leaves faded; what replaced it was roasted, faintly burnt—like sugar caramelizing, or hair.

Mitzy slowed. “What’s that smell?”

Larry didn’t answer right away. He was circling low, the tip of one wing grazing the dirt as if he were tasting the ground. When he spoke, it wasn’t with a joke. “Smoke,” he said. “And meat.”

She looked at him. “There’s a fire?”

“Or a kitchen,” he said. “Mazes love kitchens.”

“That’s not funny.”

“I’m not trying to be.”

The corridor sloped downward, each step sinking a little deeper. The light changed too—less green, more gold, flickering like candlelight through water. The hum that had haunted every other part of the Maze was gone now, replaced by silence so thick it seemed to press against her ears.

Mitzy tightened her grip on the spear. “Where’s it taking us?”

Larry gave a soft, distracted hum. “Smell it long enough, you’ll see.”

The gold light thickened into smoke that moved without wind. It curled around Mitzy’s ankles, tracing lazy patterns as she walked. Beneath it, the ground was warm.

Then she saw footprints—two sets, pressed deep into the dirt. One small. One smaller.

Her stomach twisted. “Larry,” she said. “These are hers.”

“Maybe.”

“They are. I remember her shoes—yellow soles. Look.”

The smaller prints glowed faintly, just for a heartbeat, as if answering her. The warmth underfoot pulsed brighter, and the smell of cooking grew stronger.

Mitzy’s voice dropped. “What’s it cooking?”

“Something that used to be lost,” Larry said quietly.

The corridor widened ahead, spilling light like an invitation. The smoke gathered thicker there, rising and falling with the sound of slow, wet breathing.

Mitzy glanced at Larry. “Is that—”

“The Goblin?” He twitched his wings once, uneasy. “If you have to ask, you’re close.”

She swallowed. “Then I’ll find June first.”

Larry’s eyes caught the gold light, glinting like coins half-buried in dirt. “Maybe she’s already found you.”



## Part 3 — The Invitation

June’s knife caught the gold light and turned it white. She held it the way a child holds a crayon—tight, but unsure what to draw.

Mitzy couldn’t breathe. Every inch of her screamed *run*, but her boots felt nailed to the ground.

The Goblin’s hand moved, pale and jointed too many times, tracing lazy circles over the table. “You should be proud,” it said. “Few make it this far still shaped like themselves.”

Mitzy’s voice came out hoarse. “What do you want?”

The Goblin’s smile flickered wider. “Want? *Want* is such a human word. I offer.”

Larry darted between them, his wings a dark blur. “Don’t listen, Princess. Every offer here has teeth.”

The Goblin ignored him. “You walked my paths. You bent my walls. You’ve earned what the others only begged for: a seat at my table, a taste of what you lost.”

“I don’t—”

“Don’t you?” it said. “You want her back.”

The Goblin gestured to June, who tilted her head, still smiling that clean, empty smile. “She’s right here. Memory made flesh. The Maze remembers what you can’t hold. All you need to do is eat.”

Mitzy’s eyes dropped to the table. The food looked real enough—roasted meat, the crusted edge of bread, a cup filled with something that smelled like apples and iron. Her stomach twisted, confused.

Larry’s voice came fast now. “Princess, don’t touch it.”

“I’m not going to,” she snapped.

The Goblin leaned closer. Its face was smooth, too smooth, but its smile moved like something alive under the surface. “Refusal tastes better,” it murmured.

“Why her?” Mitzy whispered.

“Because you dreamed her hungry,” it said. “Because you needed someone smaller than you to save.”

June’s fork scraped her plate—an awful, high sound that made Mitzy’s teeth hurt. “Sit with me,” June said. “I saved your place.”

Mitzy shook her head. “You’re not real.”

June’s face twitched—just once—and for the first time, she looked scared. “I know,” she said softly. “But if you leave me, I stop being even that.”

The Goblin’s laugh rustled through the Maze like dry leaves. “Every feast needs mercy,” it said. “Go on, girl. Show her yours.”

Mitzy’s hands shook. She lifted the spear, pointing it at the table. “You’re lying.”

“Always,” said the Goblin. “But lies are the closest truth to wanting.”

The Maze around them pulsed, the gold light deepening to red. Roots crept from the walls, curling around the table legs like vines around prey.

Larry whispered, almost pleading now. “Decide fast, Princess. The room’s getting hungry.”

Mitzy met June’s eyes—those mirrored eyes—and whispered, “I’m not eating.”

The Goblin tilted its head, amused. “Then you’ll be eaten remembering her.”

---

## Part 4 — The Turning of the Table

The Goblin clapped once.

It didn’t sound like skin meeting skin. It sounded like two stones grinding together underwater.

The table shuddered. Every plate trembled, every cup spilled. The air filled with the smell of smoke and rot and something too sweet to be kind.

Mitzy stepped back, dragging June with her, but the Maze leaned forward. The hedges pressed in, leaves unfolding like mouths, each whispering the same word in different tones.

*Eat.  
Eat.  
Eat.*

The roasted meats on the table split open. Not flesh—*faces*. Eyes blinked from the crust of bread, lips gasped through the apple skins. The voices came thin and layered, singing the same terrible note of hunger.

June screamed. The sound was small and real and human, and it almost undid Mitzy right there.

Larry swooped low, shouting, “Don’t look, Princess! It’s only showing you what you want to save!”

But Mitzy *did* look. And saw her own reflection in every dish—dozens of Mitzys, each older, smaller, angrier, kinder—each frozen in the act of reaching for someone they loved.

“What is this?” she cried.

The Goblin rose. Its body unrolled like paper soaked in water, limbs too many, joints too few. When it spoke, the sound came from every mouth on the table, every whisper in the wall, every echo of her name she’d ever left behind.

“This,” it said, “is remembering. The Maze eats what you can’t hold.”

Mitzy dragged June behind her. “You can’t have her.”

“She’s already given,” said the Goblin. “All that’s left is the flavor you add.”

The walls swayed; the air tasted of metal. The spear in Mitzy’s hands hummed—an iron note that cut through the noise like lightning splitting sky. Larry hissed, “Whatever you do, do it *now*.”

Mitzy raised the spear high and drove it through the table. The wood screamed. Light burst from the crack—a flood of white so bright it erased everything for a heartbeat.

When her vision cleared, the table was gone. The food, the plates, the Goblin—*gone*.

Only June remained, sitting on the floor, trembling. Her eyes were hers again.

“Mitzy,” she whispered.

Mitzy ran to her, kneeling, taking her by the shoulders. “We have to move. Now.”

But June’s gaze wasn’t on her. She was looking past Mitzy, at the floor where the spear had pierced it.

The ground there pulsed faintly, still glowing at the edges of the wound. A voice rose from that light—soft, familiar, and tired.

*You taught it how to bend.*

Mitzy’s stomach turned to ice.

Larry hovered above them, silent. Even he looked afraid.

The whisper came again, everywhere at once.

*Now it bends for you.*

---

## Part 5 — The Escape That Isn’t

Mitzy pulled June to her feet. “Run.”

June didn’t argue. They bolted, the Maze parting just enough for them to believe it wanted them gone.

The corridors blurred past—tunnels of root and gold light, walls breathing faster than lungs should. The ground flexed beneath them, each step sinking and rising as if the Maze was moving with their pace.

Behind them, the voice of the Goblin rode the air like distant thunder: *You wanted her safe. Now she is. Inside you.*

Mitzy gritted her teeth and ran harder. “Ignore it. It’s just noise.”

Larry kept pace, a streak of shadow beside them. “Princess, it’s never *just* noise.”

The walls pulsed, responding to her heartbeat. When she turned left, the corridor stretched that way; when she flinched from a flicker of light, the hedge recoiled. The Maze wasn’t chasing anymore. It was *following.*

June stumbled, dragging Mitzy down with her. They hit the dirt. The walls leaned in like curious faces.

Mitzy rolled onto her knees, clutching her sister. “It’s okay. It’s okay, I’ve got you.”

June’s voice was small. “It listens to you.”

“No. It’s—”

“It *moves* when you tell it to.”

Mitzy froze. The leaves nearest her quivered, waiting. She felt it then—the thin hum of the Maze’s pulse, tuned perfectly to her own. She didn’t move, didn’t breathe. The air around her waited too.

Larry landed between them, wings low. “You see it now, don’t you?”

“Make it stop.”

He laughed softly, almost sorry. “You can’t unteach what you’ve taught. You showed it how to listen.”

The hedge to her right rustled, then peeled open like a curtain. Beyond it, she saw flashes of daylight—the first real light she’d seen in forever.

June gasped. “Home!”

Mitzy grabbed her wrist. “Wait—”

June wrenched free, bolting toward the opening. Mitzy lunged after her.

The light flared brighter—and vanished.

Where the exit had been, there was only more hedge, still dripping with golden sap. The Maze had closed its mouth.

Mitzy turned on Larry, shaking. “It’s playing with us.”

“It’s learning affection,” he said softly. “You taught it mercy. Now it wants to keep you.”

“I don’t want to stay!”

The walls leaned closer, almost tender.

Larry’s voice dropped to a whisper. “That’s what they all said right before it loved them back.”

Mitzy pressed her palms to the dirt, breath shaking. “If it listens, then it can *hear* me.”

“Princess—”

She shouted at the Maze. “Let her go!”

The ground pulsed once. The wall behind June shivered. Then, without sound, the Maze obeyed. A seam opened. June stumbled through it—and was gone.

The seam sealed shut again before Mitzy could follow.

“June!” she screamed.

No answer.

The air stilled. Larry’s wings barely moved. “Congratulations,” he said quietly. “You’re the Maze now.”

# Chapter 8

# Act IV — The Unmaking

# Chapter 8 — The Girl Who Stayed
## Part 1 — Afterlight

Silence settled like dust after rain.

For the first time since waking in the Maze, Mitzy couldn’t hear breathing—hers, the Maze’s, or anyone else’s. Even Larry was quiet, wings folded, perched on the end of her spear like a tiny flag at half-mast.

The air hung heavy with the scent of earth and smoke. The gold light that had soaked everything before was gone; what replaced it was dim, greenish—like light filtered through skin.

“Larry?” she whispered.

He tilted his head but didn’t answer.

The quiet pressed harder, shaping itself around her words until she felt them come back, muffled, as if the Maze were trying to repeat them under its breath.

“June’s out,” she said. “It let her go.”

Larry fluttered once. “It did what you told it to.”

“She’s safe.”

“That’s one definition.”

Mitzy turned in a slow circle. The corridor behind her was gone. Ahead stretched a single straight path, no bends, no mirrors, no choice. The walls were smooth now—no leaves, no roots—only pale, living bark. Every so often it twitched.

She touched it with the tip of her spear. The wall shivered like skin meeting cold metal. The vibration ran down the shaft, into her arm, through her chest. For a heartbeat, the Maze’s pulse matched her own.

“Larry,” she said quietly. “I think I can feel it breathing again.”

He didn’t move. “You don’t *feel* it, Princess. You *are* it.”

Her stomach dropped. “That’s not funny.”

“No,” Larry said, “it isn’t.”

The wall behind her flexed. She turned and saw the faint outline of a hand pushing out from the bark—small fingers, the shape of her own. Then another. Then dozens. The corridor filled with faint impressions, all reaching toward her, all *hers.*

“Make them stop,” she whispered.

“I can’t,” Larry said. “They’re memories. You’re blooming.”

The hands faded, leaving smooth bark again. The Maze sighed—soft, contented, alive.

Mitzy gripped her spear. “Then I’ll find a way to un-bloom.”

Larry finally met her gaze. His eyes were dark, reflective, carrying the faintest trace of sorrow. “If you un-bloom,” he said, “there’ll be nothing left to grow from.”

Mitzy lifted the spear and pointed it at her chest. “Then maybe that’s the point.”

The Maze shivered. The floor under her feet trembled once, like a heart skipping a beat. From somewhere deep in the roots below came a voice—soft, exhausted, and unmistakably her own.

*Don’t. We just learned how to live.*



## Part 3 — The Root and the Wing

At first there was only light.

Not bright—just vast. A light with no edges, the kind that erases the idea of corners. It poured through the split bark, running in veins along the floor, threading through the roots that had once been walls.

Mitzy felt it in her chest, a spreading warmth that was almost pain. Every heartbeat went somewhere else—to the trees, the air, the earth. It wasn’t leaving her; it was dividing.

Larry’s body trembled in her hand. His wings looked thin enough to see through. The glow that had filled the Maze now came from him, not the walls.

Mitzy blinked through tears. “You—You’re dying.”

He laughed softly. “Not dying. Dispersing. Butterflies never die, Princess. They just remember different shapes.”

“I don’t understand.”

“That’s the closest anyone gets to understanding.”

She looked around. The walls were gone now. In their place stretched a vast, open grove—trees made of the same pale bark, roots glimmering with green light. The air smelled of rain and something clean, like the moment after lightning.

“It’s beautiful,” she said.

“It’s you,” Larry murmured. “The Maze without the hunger.”

Her breath caught. “Then I—”

“Yes,” he said. “You unmade it. Or remade it. Hard to tell which from this side.”

She looked down at him, his body dimming with each word. “And you?”

Larry tilted his head, his voice fading to a whisper. “I’m what’s left when the story finishes talking.”

The air shimmered; a single black wing detached from him, rising like smoke. The rest followed until he was gone, just a faint trail of ash and light that spun once, twice, and scattered into the canopy.

Mitzy stood alone.

The spear lay at her feet. When she picked it up, it felt lighter—less like a weapon, more like a branch waiting to grow.

Somewhere far above, she thought she heard birds again. Not the false, mirrored kind—the real ones.

The ground under her boots was still breathing, but slower now. Gentle. Alive, not hungry.

She closed her eyes. “If you’re still listening,” she said to the air, “let her stay free.”

The grove exhaled, and the whisper came back:

*She already is. You were the one who stayed.*

Mitzy’s knees gave way. She sank to the earth, the new roots cradling her as if they had always known her shape. Her breath came slow, steady, then matched the rhythm of the world around her.

For the first time, the Maze didn’t echo her name. It whispered it softly, like a prayer.

# Chapter 9

# Chapter 9 — The Return Path
## Part 1 — The Quiet Outside

The first thing June noticed was the wind.

Real wind. Cold, uneven, carrying salt and birdsong and the smell of grass after rain.

She lay on her back at the edge of a field that sloped toward a gray-green sea. The sky above her was the color of worn tin, streaked with white. A gull traced lazy circles high overhead.

For a long time she didn’t move. Her hands were dirty. Her shoes—yellow soles, scuffed—were damp with dew. When she finally sat up, her head spun; the horizon seemed too wide.

The Maze was gone. Behind her, where the boxwoods should have been, there was only a ring of bare earth, roots curling inward like fingers that had just let go.

June stood. Her voice came out small. “Mitzy?”

No answer.

The sea murmured below the cliffs. The air tasted clean and cruelly ordinary.

She looked down at her hands again. Under the grime, faint green veins glimmered in her wrists, like threads catching the light for an instant before fading. When she touched them, they pulsed once—soft, like the heartbeat of something sleeping.

June bit her lip. “You promised,” she whispered to no one.

The wind shifted, carrying a smell she hadn’t noticed at first—sweet, metallic, almost like honey burning in the back of a pan. Her stomach turned. “No. No, we’re out. We’re done.”

A shadow flickered across her feet. She looked down. A single black butterfly settled on her shoelace.

Its wings were frayed, edges dusted with silver, but its body gleamed faintly green in the middle—like moss under glass.

June crouched. “Larry?”

The butterfly tilted its wings once, as if nodding. Then it lifted off, circling her head twice before drifting toward the tree line inland.

June hesitated. Then followed.



## Part 3 — The Promise Kept

June leaned against the hollow tree, breath trembling between laughter and sobs. “I don’t understand,” she said. “If you’re here, if you *are* this… can’t you come back?”

The voice that was Mitzy breathed through the bark and soil, quiet as wind in tall grass.

*I tried once. It’s how the wound started. The Maze was made of wanting. When I stopped wanting, it stopped needing to feed.*

June pressed her forehead against the tree. “That’s not fair.”

*No,* said the voice, *but it’s peace.*

The butterfly had come to rest in the hollow now, its wings closing like hands in prayer. The light inside it dimmed, then steadied, pulsing with the same rhythm as the tree, as the ground, as June’s heart.

“You said you’d always look after me.”

*I am.*

“This isn’t the same.”

*It’s better,* said Mitzy. *Now you don’t have to be afraid of losing me. I’m everywhere you stand.*

June wanted to argue. She wanted to break the trunk open and drag her sister home by the wrist if she had to. But the grove was breathing with her, matching her heartbeat perfectly, and the air smelled like summer again—the real kind, not the Maze’s imitation.

She whispered, “What do I do now?”

*Live,* Mitzy said simply. *And if you remember me, remember me kindly. The Maze can grow again if you feed it grief.*

June wiped her face. “And you? You’ll sleep?”

*No. I’ll listen. The world needs someone to listen.*

The butterfly lifted from the hollow and circled June once before settling in her hair. Its wings brushed her ear—a touch so soft it felt like breath.

June closed her eyes. “Goodbye, Mitz.”

The pulse slowed. The glow inside the tree faded to a calm, steady green. The forest sighed—a long, content exhale—and went still.

June stood for a while, hand on the trunk, feeling its warmth soak into her skin. When she finally turned away, the roots shifted behind her, weaving into the soil until the hollow was gone, replaced by an ordinary tree with rough bark and shadows that didn’t move.

She stepped back into the field. The sea glittered beyond, gray and endless.

As she walked toward it, the butterfly rose into the sky and vanished into the light.

---

# Chapter 10

# Epilogue — White Magic (Reprise)
## Part 1 — The New Beginning

_Echo:_ The butterfly rose into the sky and vanished into the light.

  

Morning keeps the afterglow of that moment—thin gold on wet grass, a breeze that smells like the first peel of an orange. June stands at the edge of the field where the boxwoods used to wall off the world. There’s no hedge now, only a wide ring of ground that refuses to grow in straight lines. Dew beads along bent stems, gathering and letting go, gathering and letting go, the way a sleeping chest rises and settles.

  

She listens. Real wind moves here, loose and uneven, not the held breath the Maze used to keep. A dog barks twice far off; a truck backfires on the road. Ordinary sounds. But under them—quieter than a clock in another room—there’s a rhythm that doesn’t belong to traffic or dogs or June. It’s in the dirt. It’s in the weeds. It’s in the small hollow of her wrist when she presses two fingers there and counts, and feels the world counting back.

  

“Hey,” she says softly, testing the air. It isn’t a prayer and isn’t not one. “I came early.”

  

Nothing answers out loud. The field answers in movement. A patch of clover leans, then rights itself. A line of ants changes direction and then remembers its old path. June steps forward, slow, the way you step into a remembered room after a long time gone.

  

She walks the perimeter the way she always does now, a slow circle that steals the cold from her hands and puts it in the hem of her sleeves. At the northeast edge stands the new tree—the first that took root after the Maze unknotted itself. It’s taller than she is, taller than the fence behind it, not yet grown into anything a botanist could name. The bark looks ordinary until the light hits it slantwise. Then a faint green filigree climbs the trunk in threads, winks once, and hides.

  

June lays her palm there. The bark is cool at first, then warmer, then warmer still—like a hand meeting hers from the other side. “Still listening?” she whispers.

  

A leaf stirs with no help from wind. The warmth steadies against her skin.

  

“Good.” She lets herself lean her forehead to the trunk. A little of the night’s ache leaves her. “I brought that math test you would’ve made fun of,” she says, voice barely a breath. “You would’ve said the story problems were lies and the numbers were smug.”

  

The tree does not laugh. But the ground near the roots gives a small, contented sigh, the way a house settles when everyone has fallen asleep.

  

June takes the folded paper from her pocket and smooths it against the bark. Red pen circles flash, then dull under shadow. She holds it there until the page warms and the crease in the middle relaxes. When she pulls it back, a faint print of green dust clings to the corner where her name is written. A smudge, nothing more. She brushes it with her thumb and decides not to.

  

Beyond the tree, the field opens toward low sun. A pair of starlings lift, cross, and drop again. Somewhere a mower starts. The world remembers how to be itself.

  

June presses her palm to the trunk one last time. “I’ll come back after school,” she says. “Tell me if the ants get anywhere interesting.”

  

The bark cools, but it doesn’t let go. It holds the last of her warmth the way skin holds a touch after the hand is gone.

  

She steps back. The green filigree vanishes. The tree is only a tree again.

  

June turns for the path. Halfway across the field she stops and looks behind her, making sure the trunk still knows the shape of her hand. It does. The place where she stood is damp, darkening into a print the size of her foot. Dew gathers at its edges, then lets go.



## Part 3 - The Passing On

The light slips lower, amber deepening toward rose.

The mower has gone silent, the hum of it left hanging in her ears like a phantom limb.

June gathers her things, slinging her bag over one shoulder.  She takes the long way home, the path that skirts the field before cutting toward the village road.

  

Halfway along, she sees him: a boy, maybe five, crouched by the ditch.

He’s talking to the air.  Or so it looks until she notices the black flicker near his knee.

  

She slows.  “Hey,” she calls gently.  “You’ll scare it.”

  

The boy looks up, solemn.  “It’s not scared,” he says.  “It told me a joke.”

  

June kneels beside him.  The butterfly perches on his outstretched finger.

Same black wings, same faint silver edge, same impossible green glow in the middle.

Her throat tightens.

  

“What kind of joke?” she asks.

  

The boy grins, missing a front tooth.  “It said, ‘Don’t touch the walls.’ Then it laughed.”

  

June laughs too, though the sound catches in her chest.  “That’s a good one.”

  

The butterfly lifts off, circling both of them once, twice, then drifts toward the field.

The boy watches, eyes wide.  “It wants me to follow.”

  

“Maybe just to the edge,” June says.  “Butterflies don’t like being crowded.”

  

He nods and runs after it, his small shoes flashing in the fading light.

The butterfly leads him to the tree—_her_ tree—where it lands for a moment on the lowest branch before rising again, higher and higher, until it disappears against the sun.

  

The boy stares a long time, then waves.  “Bye-bye!” he shouts.

  

June stands behind him, quiet, her smile soft and tired and full.

“Yeah,” she says.  “Bye-bye.”

  

The boy turns.  “Do you think it’ll come back?”

  

June looks at the field—the grass, the tree, the earth breathing slow and steady under the dusk.

She nods.  “It always does.”

  

They walk toward the road together, shadows long and twin.

Behind them, the wind stirs the clover.

The field exhales once—an old, contented sigh—and the sound folds itself into evening.

# Act III — The Feast

# Chapter 7 — The Feast of the Goblin
## Part 1 — The Scent of Smoke

The air changed before the path did.

It grew heavy with sweetness, the kind that clings to the back of your throat until you can’t tell if you’re breathing or swallowing it. The green smell of leaves faded; what replaced it was roasted, faintly burnt—like sugar caramelizing, or hair.

Mitzy slowed. “What’s that smell?”

Larry didn’t answer right away. He was circling low, the tip of one wing grazing the dirt as if he were tasting the ground. When he spoke, it wasn’t with a joke. “Smoke,” he said. “And meat.”

She looked at him. “There’s a fire?”

“Or a kitchen,” he said. “Mazes love kitchens.”

“That’s not funny.”

“I’m not trying to be.”

The corridor sloped downward, each step sinking a little deeper. The light changed too—less green, more gold, flickering like candlelight through water. The hum that had haunted every other part of the Maze was gone now, replaced by silence so thick it seemed to press against her ears.

Mitzy tightened her grip on the spear. “Where’s it taking us?”

Larry gave a soft, distracted hum. “Smell it long enough, you’ll see.”

The gold light thickened into smoke that moved without wind. It curled around Mitzy’s ankles, tracing lazy patterns as she walked. Beneath it, the ground was warm.

Then she saw footprints—two sets, pressed deep into the dirt. One small. One smaller.

Her stomach twisted. “Larry,” she said. “These are hers.”

“Maybe.”

“They are. I remember her shoes—yellow soles. Look.”

The smaller prints glowed faintly, just for a heartbeat, as if answering her. The warmth underfoot pulsed brighter, and the smell of cooking grew stronger.

Mitzy’s voice dropped. “What’s it cooking?”

“Something that used to be lost,” Larry said quietly.

The corridor widened ahead, spilling light like an invitation. The smoke gathered thicker there, rising and falling with the sound of slow, wet breathing.

Mitzy glanced at Larry. “Is that—”

“The Goblin?” He twitched his wings once, uneasy. “If you have to ask, you’re close.”

She swallowed. “Then I’ll find June first.”

Larry’s eyes caught the gold light, glinting like coins half-buried in dirt. “Maybe she’s already found you.”

---

## Part 2 — The Banquet Hall

The passage opened like a throat widening for breath. Mitzy stepped through and felt the world’s shape change. The air was hot, wet, and smelled of iron and honey.

They stood inside a circular clearing ringed with boxwood so tall the sky was gone again. The walls gleamed—polished from smoke—and in their reflection, the gold light rippled like fire on metal.

At the center sat a long wooden table. Its surface was scarred with burns and carvings that almost looked like words. Platters covered it, stacked high with food that shimmered too much to be real: meats that steamed without heat, apples that bled clear syrup, bread breathing as though it had lungs.

And at the head of the table sat June.

She was clean, too clean. Her hair was brushed flat, her dress white as candlewax. Her hands were folded on her lap. Her eyes—gray-green like Mitzy’s—shone with the same golden reflection as the food.

“June,” Mitzy whispered.

The girl turned her head, slow and precise, as though the motion were learned. Her smile was small and exact. “You made it.”

Mitzy’s chest tightened. “We have to go. Now.”

June looked past her, eyes tracking Larry as he circled overhead. “Larry can’t help you,” she said. “He never could. He just talks.”

Larry’s wings faltered mid-beat. “That’s—fair,” he admitted.

Mitzy moved closer to her sister. “June, listen to me. This isn’t real. It’s the Maze playing tricks again.”

“Tricks?” June’s smile widened, showing teeth too sharp for her mouth. “No. It’s supper.”

Mitzy froze. “What?”

A shadow detached itself from the far end of the table. It wasn’t a man, not quite. The shape was close enough to fool you until you looked too long. Its limbs were a little too long, its posture a little too still. When it breathed, the sound came from behind its ribs instead of through its mouth.

The Goblin’s eyes were black hollows, each holding a flicker of gold—like candles burned to their last inch. Its voice came low, soft, almost kind.

“She’s been waiting.”

Mitzy took a step back, spear raised. “Get away from her.”

The Goblin tilted its head, studying her. “Why?” it asked. “You brought her here.”

“I didn’t!”

The Goblin smiled—small, dry, familiar. Larry flinched.

“Don’t,” he said under his breath.

Mitzy’s stomach turned. “Larry… it sounds like—”

“Don’t *say* it,” Larry hissed. “Don’t give it a name.”

The Goblin’s grin widened. “Names are dinner, little one.”

It gestured toward the table. “Eat. You’ve earned your place.”

Mitzy tightened her grip on the spear. “Where’s my sister?”

The Goblin leaned forward. “Right there,” it said, and pointed to June.

June’s small hand slid across the table and picked up a knife that gleamed too bright. She smiled at Mitzy, her voice soft and wrong. “Hungry?”

---

## Part 3 — The Invitation

June’s knife caught the gold light and turned it white. She held it the way a child holds a crayon—tight, but unsure what to draw.

Mitzy couldn’t breathe. Every inch of her screamed *run*, but her boots felt nailed to the ground.

The Goblin’s hand moved, pale and jointed too many times, tracing lazy circles over the table. “You should be proud,” it said. “Few make it this far still shaped like themselves.”

Mitzy’s voice came out hoarse. “What do you want?”

The Goblin’s smile flickered wider. “Want? *Want* is such a human word. I offer.”

Larry darted between them, his wings a dark blur. “Don’t listen, Princess. Every offer here has teeth.”

The Goblin ignored him. “You walked my paths. You bent my walls. You’ve earned what the others only begged for: a seat at my table, a taste of what you lost.”

“I don’t—”

“Don’t you?” it said. “You want her back.”

The Goblin gestured to June, who tilted her head, still smiling that clean, empty smile. “She’s right here. Memory made flesh. The Maze remembers what you can’t hold. All you need to do is eat.”

Mitzy’s eyes dropped to the table. The food looked real enough—roasted meat, the crusted edge of bread, a cup filled with something that smelled like apples and iron. Her stomach twisted, confused.

Larry’s voice came fast now. “Princess, don’t touch it.”

“I’m not going to,” she snapped.

The Goblin leaned closer. Its face was smooth, too smooth, but its smile moved like something alive under the surface. “Refusal tastes better,” it murmured.

“Why her?” Mitzy whispered.

“Because you dreamed her hungry,” it said. “Because you needed someone smaller than you to save.”

June’s fork scraped her plate—an awful, high sound that made Mitzy’s teeth hurt. “Sit with me,” June said. “I saved your place.”

Mitzy shook her head. “You’re not real.”

June’s face twitched—just once—and for the first time, she looked scared. “I know,” she said softly. “But if you leave me, I stop being even that.”

The Goblin’s laugh rustled through the Maze like dry leaves. “Every feast needs mercy,” it said. “Go on, girl. Show her yours.”

Mitzy’s hands shook. She lifted the spear, pointing it at the table. “You’re lying.”

“Always,” said the Goblin. “But lies are the closest truth to wanting.”

The Maze around them pulsed, the gold light deepening to red. Roots crept from the walls, curling around the table legs like vines around prey.

Larry whispered, almost pleading now. “Decide fast, Princess. The room’s getting hungry.”

Mitzy met June’s eyes—those mirrored eyes—and whispered, “I’m not eating.”

The Goblin tilted its head, amused. “Then you’ll be eaten remembering her.”

---

## Part 4 — The Turning of the Table

The Goblin clapped once.

It didn’t sound like skin meeting skin. It sounded like two stones grinding together underwater.

The table shuddered. Every plate trembled, every cup spilled. The air filled with the smell of smoke and rot and something too sweet to be kind.

Mitzy stepped back, dragging June with her, but the Maze leaned forward. The hedges pressed in, leaves unfolding like mouths, each whispering the same word in different tones.

*Eat.  
Eat.  
Eat.*

The roasted meats on the table split open. Not flesh—*faces*. Eyes blinked from the crust of bread, lips gasped through the apple skins. The voices came thin and layered, singing the same terrible note of hunger.

June screamed. The sound was small and real and human, and it almost undid Mitzy right there.

Larry swooped low, shouting, “Don’t look, Princess! It’s only showing you what you want to save!”

But Mitzy *did* look. And saw her own reflection in every dish—dozens of Mitzys, each older, smaller, angrier, kinder—each frozen in the act of reaching for someone they loved.

“What is this?” she cried.

The Goblin rose. Its body unrolled like paper soaked in water, limbs too many, joints too few. When it spoke, the sound came from every mouth on the table, every whisper in the wall, every echo of her name she’d ever left behind.

“This,” it said, “is remembering. The Maze eats what you can’t hold.”

Mitzy dragged June behind her. “You can’t have her.”

“She’s already given,” said the Goblin. “All that’s left is the flavor you add.”

The walls swayed; the air tasted of metal. The spear in Mitzy’s hands hummed—an iron note that cut through the noise like lightning splitting sky. Larry hissed, “Whatever you do, do it *now*.”

Mitzy raised the spear high and drove it through the table. The wood screamed. Light burst from the crack—a flood of white so bright it erased everything for a heartbeat.

When her vision cleared, the table was gone. The food, the plates, the Goblin—*gone*.

Only June remained, sitting on the floor, trembling. Her eyes were hers again.

“Mitzy,” she whispered.

Mitzy ran to her, kneeling, taking her by the shoulders. “We have to move. Now.”

But June’s gaze wasn’t on her. She was looking past Mitzy, at the floor where the spear had pierced it.

The ground there pulsed faintly, still glowing at the edges of the wound. A voice rose from that light—soft, familiar, and tired.

*You taught it how to bend.*

Mitzy’s stomach turned to ice.

Larry hovered above them, silent. Even he looked afraid.

The whisper came again, everywhere at once.

*Now it bends for you.*

---

## Part 5 — The Escape That Isn’t

Mitzy pulled June to her feet. “Run.”

June didn’t argue. They bolted, the Maze parting just enough for them to believe it wanted them gone.

The corridors blurred past—tunnels of root and gold light, walls breathing faster than lungs should. The ground flexed beneath them, each step sinking and rising as if the Maze was moving with their pace.

Behind them, the voice of the Goblin rode the air like distant thunder: *You wanted her safe. Now she is. Inside you.*

Mitzy gritted her teeth and ran harder. “Ignore it. It’s just noise.”

Larry kept pace, a streak of shadow beside them. “Princess, it’s never *just* noise.”

The walls pulsed, responding to her heartbeat. When she turned left, the corridor stretched that way; when she flinched from a flicker of light, the hedge recoiled. The Maze wasn’t chasing anymore. It was *following.*

June stumbled, dragging Mitzy down with her. They hit the dirt. The walls leaned in like curious faces.

Mitzy rolled onto her knees, clutching her sister. “It’s okay. It’s okay, I’ve got you.”

June’s voice was small. “It listens to you.”

“No. It’s—”

“It *moves* when you tell it to.”

Mitzy froze. The leaves nearest her quivered, waiting. She felt it then—the thin hum of the Maze’s pulse, tuned perfectly to her own. She didn’t move, didn’t breathe. The air around her waited too.

Larry landed between them, wings low. “You see it now, don’t you?”

“Make it stop.”

He laughed softly, almost sorry. “You can’t unteach what you’ve taught. You showed it how to listen.”

The hedge to her right rustled, then peeled open like a curtain. Beyond it, she saw flashes of daylight—the first real light she’d seen in forever.

June gasped. “Home!”

Mitzy grabbed her wrist. “Wait—”

June wrenched free, bolting toward the opening. Mitzy lunged after her.

The light flared brighter—and vanished.

Where the exit had been, there was only more hedge, still dripping with golden sap. The Maze had closed its mouth.

Mitzy turned on Larry, shaking. “It’s playing with us.”

“It’s learning affection,” he said softly. “You taught it mercy. Now it wants to keep you.”

“I don’t want to stay!”

The walls leaned closer, almost tender.

Larry’s voice dropped to a whisper. “That’s what they all said right before it loved them back.”

Mitzy pressed her palms to the dirt, breath shaking. “If it listens, then it can *hear* me.”

“Princess—”

She shouted at the Maze. “Let her go!”

The ground pulsed once. The wall behind June shivered. Then, without sound, the Maze obeyed. A seam opened. June stumbled through it—and was gone.

The seam sealed shut again before Mitzy could follow.

“June!” she screamed.

No answer.

The air stilled. Larry’s wings barely moved. “Congratulations,” he said quietly. “You’re the Maze now.”

# Act IV — The Unmaking

# Chapter 8 — The Girl Who Stayed
## Part 1 — Afterlight

Silence settled like dust after rain.

For the first time since waking in the Maze, Mitzy couldn’t hear breathing—hers, the Maze’s, or anyone else’s. Even Larry was quiet, wings folded, perched on the end of her spear like a tiny flag at half-mast.

The air hung heavy with the scent of earth and smoke. The gold light that had soaked everything before was gone; what replaced it was dim, greenish—like light filtered through skin.

“Larry?” she whispered.

He tilted his head but didn’t answer.

The quiet pressed harder, shaping itself around her words until she felt them come back, muffled, as if the Maze were trying to repeat them under its breath.

“June’s out,” she said. “It let her go.”

Larry fluttered once. “It did what you told it to.”

“She’s safe.”

“That’s one definition.”

Mitzy turned in a slow circle. The corridor behind her was gone. Ahead stretched a single straight path, no bends, no mirrors, no choice. The walls were smooth now—no leaves, no roots—only pale, living bark. Every so often it twitched.

She touched it with the tip of her spear. The wall shivered like skin meeting cold metal. The vibration ran down the shaft, into her arm, through her chest. For a heartbeat, the Maze’s pulse matched her own.

“Larry,” she said quietly. “I think I can feel it breathing again.”

He didn’t move. “You don’t *feel* it, Princess. You *are* it.”

Her stomach dropped. “That’s not funny.”

“No,” Larry said, “it isn’t.”

The wall behind her flexed. She turned and saw the faint outline of a hand pushing out from the bark—small fingers, the shape of her own. Then another. Then dozens. The corridor filled with faint impressions, all reaching toward her, all *hers.*

“Make them stop,” she whispered.

“I can’t,” Larry said. “They’re memories. You’re blooming.”

The hands faded, leaving smooth bark again. The Maze sighed—soft, contented, alive.

Mitzy gripped her spear. “Then I’ll find a way to un-bloom.”

Larry finally met her gaze. His eyes were dark, reflective, carrying the faintest trace of sorrow. “If you un-bloom,” he said, “there’ll be nothing left to grow from.”

Mitzy lifted the spear and pointed it at her chest. “Then maybe that’s the point.”

The Maze shivered. The floor under her feet trembled once, like a heart skipping a beat. From somewhere deep in the roots below came a voice—soft, exhausted, and unmistakably her own.

*Don’t. We just learned how to live.*

---

## Part 2 — The Butterfly’s Choice

The air between them thickened. The smell of mint and iron returned—every scent the Maze had ever used to trick her, now faint, nostalgic, almost tender.

Mitzy stood still, spear point pressed to her sternum. Her hand didn’t shake. “Do it,” she said. “If I’m the Maze, then killing me ends it.”

Larry didn’t answer right away. He fluttered from the spear to her shoulder, his weight almost nothing. When he spoke, his voice had lost its rasp and its humor. “I’ve seen hundreds make that promise,” he said. “Every one of them thought they were different.”

“I am,” Mitzy said.

He gave a quiet, sad laugh. “That’s what they all said too.”

She turned her head toward him, eyes wet but steady. “Please, Larry. Don’t let it keep me.”

He looked past her, at the walls, which pulsed faintly with green light. The Maze had gone still—not retreating, not closing in—just watching. Every root and vein hummed softly, like a question.

“I can’t,” he said finally.

“Yes, you can. You said you were my guide.”

“I said I talk. I never said I save.”

Mitzy closed her eyes. “Then why follow me at all?”

“Because I wanted to see if you’d do what the others couldn’t.”

Her grip on the spear tightened. “And what’s that?”

“Stop fighting long enough to love something you hate.”

The Maze shuddered. The corridor flickered with light like breath catching in a throat.

Mitzy opened her eyes again, tired now. “Then you’ve seen it. You’ve seen enough.” She pressed the spear harder against her chest. “Do it.”

Larry landed on the spear haft. The Maze’s pulse quickened. The bark along the walls began to split, thin seams opening like eyelids. From each came a whisper:

*Don’t break what’s finally whole.*

Larry looked up at her face, and for a long moment, he didn’t look like a butterfly at all—he looked like a shadow caught between shapes. When he spoke, his voice was different—older, gentler, more human than insect.

“If I kill you,” he said, “the Maze dies. If I don’t, you stop being you. So which is mercy, Princess?”

Mitzy exhaled, slow. “You decide.”

The Maze trembled, leaves fluttering though there was no wind. The pulse grew louder, deeper, filling the air until it was hard to tell if it came from the walls or her own ribs.

Larry rose, wings spreading wide. The air around him shimmered—black turning to blue, then white. His voice echoed in every direction at once.

“I was made to talk,” he said. “But I can still sing.”

He sang.

It wasn’t a melody, not really—just a vibration that tore through the air like a note struck on both sides of silence. The walls convulsed. The bark split wider. Light poured out, green turning to silver.

Mitzy cried out. The spear fell from her hands. The Maze’s pulse broke rhythm—then stilled.

Larry’s glow dimmed. He drifted down, landing on her open palm. He looked smaller than ever, fragile, translucent.

Mitzy whispered, “Did it work?”

He didn’t answer.

The silence came back, but it wasn’t empty now. It was listening for something that hadn’t happened yet.

---

## Part 3 — The Root and the Wing

At first there was only light.

Not bright—just vast. A light with no edges, the kind that erases the idea of corners. It poured through the split bark, running in veins along the floor, threading through the roots that had once been walls.

Mitzy felt it in her chest, a spreading warmth that was almost pain. Every heartbeat went somewhere else—to the trees, the air, the earth. It wasn’t leaving her; it was dividing.

Larry’s body trembled in her hand. His wings looked thin enough to see through. The glow that had filled the Maze now came from him, not the walls.

Mitzy blinked through tears. “You—You’re dying.”

He laughed softly. “Not dying. Dispersing. Butterflies never die, Princess. They just remember different shapes.”

“I don’t understand.”

“That’s the closest anyone gets to understanding.”

She looked around. The walls were gone now. In their place stretched a vast, open grove—trees made of the same pale bark, roots glimmering with green light. The air smelled of rain and something clean, like the moment after lightning.

“It’s beautiful,” she said.

“It’s you,” Larry murmured. “The Maze without the hunger.”

Her breath caught. “Then I—”

“Yes,” he said. “You unmade it. Or remade it. Hard to tell which from this side.”

She looked down at him, his body dimming with each word. “And you?”

Larry tilted his head, his voice fading to a whisper. “I’m what’s left when the story finishes talking.”

The air shimmered; a single black wing detached from him, rising like smoke. The rest followed until he was gone, just a faint trail of ash and light that spun once, twice, and scattered into the canopy.

Mitzy stood alone.

The spear lay at her feet. When she picked it up, it felt lighter—less like a weapon, more like a branch waiting to grow.

Somewhere far above, she thought she heard birds again. Not the false, mirrored kind—the real ones.

The ground under her boots was still breathing, but slower now. Gentle. Alive, not hungry.

She closed her eyes. “If you’re still listening,” she said to the air, “let her stay free.”

The grove exhaled, and the whisper came back:

*She already is. You were the one who stayed.*

Mitzy’s knees gave way. She sank to the earth, the new roots cradling her as if they had always known her shape. Her breath came slow, steady, then matched the rhythm of the world around her.

For the first time, the Maze didn’t echo her name. It whispered it softly, like a prayer.

# Chapter 9 — The Return Path
## Part 1 — The Quiet Outside

The first thing June noticed was the wind.

Real wind. Cold, uneven, carrying salt and birdsong and the smell of grass after rain.

She lay on her back at the edge of a field that sloped toward a gray-green sea. The sky above her was the color of worn tin, streaked with white. A gull traced lazy circles high overhead.

For a long time she didn’t move. Her hands were dirty. Her shoes—yellow soles, scuffed—were damp with dew. When she finally sat up, her head spun; the horizon seemed too wide.

The Maze was gone. Behind her, where the boxwoods should have been, there was only a ring of bare earth, roots curling inward like fingers that had just let go.

June stood. Her voice came out small. “Mitzy?”

No answer.

The sea murmured below the cliffs. The air tasted clean and cruelly ordinary.

She looked down at her hands again. Under the grime, faint green veins glimmered in her wrists, like threads catching the light for an instant before fading. When she touched them, they pulsed once—soft, like the heartbeat of something sleeping.

June bit her lip. “You promised,” she whispered to no one.

The wind shifted, carrying a smell she hadn’t noticed at first—sweet, metallic, almost like honey burning in the back of a pan. Her stomach turned. “No. No, we’re out. We’re done.”

A shadow flickered across her feet. She looked down. A single black butterfly settled on her shoelace.

Its wings were frayed, edges dusted with silver, but its body gleamed faintly green in the middle—like moss under glass.

June crouched. “Larry?”

The butterfly tilted its wings once, as if nodding. Then it lifted off, circling her head twice before drifting toward the tree line inland.

June hesitated. Then followed.

---

## Part 2 — The Hollow Tree

The path down from the cliffs was easy at first—soft earth, wild grass, stones warm from the morning sun. The butterfly never hurried. It stayed just ahead, gliding low, sometimes vanishing between blades of grass only to reappear further up the hill.

June’s legs ached by the time she reached the tree line. The air changed again—cooler, still, thick with the smell of soil and sap.

The butterfly dipped between the trees, and she followed.

It wasn’t a forest she recognized. The trunks were too pale, their bark smooth as skin, no leaves overhead—only long, thin threads of green light hanging like vines. Each thread pulsed faintly, slow and even, like breathing.

“Mitzy?” June whispered.

The grove listened.

A few of the threads brightened in response, their glow washing the air with soft green. She reached out and touched one. It was warm, and it hummed faintly beneath her fingers.

The butterfly landed on her wrist. Its wings were almost translucent now, the veins tracing out a shape she half recognized—the Maze’s pattern, the one she’d traced on the kitchen table when they’d tried to map it from memory.

“Why bring me here?” she asked.

The butterfly didn’t move.

June looked past it, deeper into the grove. At the center stood a tree wider than the others, hollowed from within. Its bark gleamed faintly silver in the filtered light. Something pulsed inside it—a slow, steady rhythm.

She walked toward it. The closer she got, the stronger the hum became. Not menacing—just *familiar.*

When she touched the trunk, the pulse aligned with hers. And in that rhythm, she heard a voice—not loud, not spoken, but felt, the way a memory feels when it surprises you.

*Little sister.*

June’s throat closed. “Mitzy?”

The light within the hollow flickered once, then steadied. The pulse quickened.

*You found the way out,* the voice said. *Good.*

June pressed her palm harder to the bark. “Where are you? I can’t see you.”

*Everywhere.*

June stepped back. The butterfly left her wrist and flew into the hollow. Its wings caught the light, scattering it in patterns like ripples on water.

“Are you… the Maze now?”

The voice hesitated—then came softer, almost human again.

*No. The Maze was the wound. I’m what healed.*

June’s eyes filled. “You promised you’d come home.”

*I did,* said the voice. *You’re standing in me.*

---

## Part 3 — The Promise Kept

June leaned against the hollow tree, breath trembling between laughter and sobs. “I don’t understand,” she said. “If you’re here, if you *are* this… can’t you come back?”

The voice that was Mitzy breathed through the bark and soil, quiet as wind in tall grass.

*I tried once. It’s how the wound started. The Maze was made of wanting. When I stopped wanting, it stopped needing to feed.*

June pressed her forehead against the tree. “That’s not fair.”

*No,* said the voice, *but it’s peace.*

The butterfly had come to rest in the hollow now, its wings closing like hands in prayer. The light inside it dimmed, then steadied, pulsing with the same rhythm as the tree, as the ground, as June’s heart.

“You said you’d always look after me.”

*I am.*

“This isn’t the same.”

*It’s better,* said Mitzy. *Now you don’t have to be afraid of losing me. I’m everywhere you stand.*

June wanted to argue. She wanted to break the trunk open and drag her sister home by the wrist if she had to. But the grove was breathing with her, matching her heartbeat perfectly, and the air smelled like summer again—the real kind, not the Maze’s imitation.

She whispered, “What do I do now?”

*Live,* Mitzy said simply. *And if you remember me, remember me kindly. The Maze can grow again if you feed it grief.*

June wiped her face. “And you? You’ll sleep?”

*No. I’ll listen. The world needs someone to listen.*

The butterfly lifted from the hollow and circled June once before settling in her hair. Its wings brushed her ear—a touch so soft it felt like breath.

June closed her eyes. “Goodbye, Mitz.”

The pulse slowed. The glow inside the tree faded to a calm, steady green. The forest sighed—a long, content exhale—and went still.

June stood for a while, hand on the trunk, feeling its warmth soak into her skin. When she finally turned away, the roots shifted behind her, weaving into the soil until the hollow was gone, replaced by an ordinary tree with rough bark and shadows that didn’t move.

She stepped back into the field. The sea glittered beyond, gray and endless.

As she walked toward it, the butterfly rose into the sky and vanished into the light.
