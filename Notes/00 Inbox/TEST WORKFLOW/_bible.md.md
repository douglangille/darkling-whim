# _bible.md — Story Bible (sample)

## @Maggie
- Watchmaker and horologist; late 30s–early 40s; precise, quietly stubborn.
- Activist applying “time drift” interventions (small, deniable disruptions).
- Core tensions: trust vs secrecy; loyalty to community over institutions.
- Tells when stressed: rubs thumb over brass ring; switches to clipped sentences.

## @Richard
- RCMP computer-forensics consultant; pattern-spotter; empathetic skeptic.
- Conflicted friendship with Maggie; values truth over protocol when stakes are human.
- Carries a scar on left wrist (old lab accident); hates ticking clocks.

## @Workshop
- Lunenburg side-street shop; oil, brass, pine dust; bay window; workbench with hidden compartment under the third drawer.
- Ambient noises: gulls, distant foghorn, street chatter; clock chorus at the hour.
- Security: camera dome (dummy), pressure catch on back door, floorboard squeaks near lathe.

## @Harbourfront
- Halifax boardwalk at dusk; tourist buskers; wind shifts bring diesel + salt.
- Old pilings, new glass; surveillance poles every 60 m; ferry horn on the quarter-hour.
- Useful cover: sea-shanty crowd, kiosks, slatted benches for stashing envelopes.

## @Clocktower
- 19th-century municipal tower; access via maintenance stairs behind library stacks.
- Regulator uses a Graham escapement; pendulum drift ±2s/day without compensation.
- Blind camera arc on north parapet between lightning rod and bell housing.

## @TechRules
- “Time drift” = interventions must be minimally detectable; if contradiction arises, choose the *least* conspicuous branch.
- Rule of three touches: any target system gets at most three manipulations before mandatory cool-down.
- Leave a reversible path: any physical alteration must be removable within 120 seconds.

## @Tone
- Grounded, near-future Nova Scotia; competence over spectacle; humor is dry, not slapstick.
- Sensory anchors: marine weather, wood, metal, old stone vs new glass.

## @Scene11Brief
- Maggie recalibrates a balky resonator in the workshop; Richard arrives early with questions about a flagged data trail.
- The fix partially works; the regulator still drifts, exposing hidden protest hardware.
- Stakes: trust wobble; decision to stash evidence before Richard notices.

## @Scene12Brief
- Harbourfront handoff at dusk; a courier fails to appear; busker crowd complicates visibility.
- Maggie improvises a decoy envelope; Richard spots a surveillance unit triangulating.
- Stakes: whether to abort or risk a soft handoff under a camera blind spot.

## @Scene13Brief
- Night entry to the clocktower to reset the bell timing before a protest.
- Unexpected maintenance crew arrives early; power blip forces a manual wind.
- Stakes: complete the reset without tripping the elevator camera cycle.
