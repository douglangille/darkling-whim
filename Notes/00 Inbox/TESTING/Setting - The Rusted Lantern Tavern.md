# The Rusted Lantern Tavern

A low-ceilinged seaside tavern in the port district of Greyharbor.
- **Smell:** Brine, woodsmoke, and overpoured ale.
- **Sounds:** Lute in the corner, gulls outside, low rumble of gossip.
- **Lighting:** Dim, mostly from the namesake lantern hung above the bar.
- **Patrons:** Sailors, dockworkers, and the occasional hooded stranger.
- **Notable Detail:** The lantern never goes out — rumor says it’s filled with ghostlight.
