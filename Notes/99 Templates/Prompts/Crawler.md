I'm going to provide you with a starting URL. Your task is to browse that initial URL and then follow all internal links (links that remain on the same domain) found on that page, going one level deep.

Once you have visited all these internal pages, create a comprehensive summary of the key information, themes, and functionalities presented across all the collected pages within that domain.

Crucially, remember this collected information as the primary context for all my subsequent questions in this conversation. Do not refer to external information unless explicitly instructed.
