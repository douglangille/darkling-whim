The butterfly flexes its wings once, twice. Each flick fans the smell of scorched paper. Its body is velvet-dark, striped faintly with dust. Mitzy goes cross-eyed trying to see it. Its feelers brush her nose and she nearly sneezes.

“Hey-ho, princess,” it says.

The words tickle through her skin more than her ear. Mitzy flinches backward so hard she smacks the hedge with her shoulder. The leaves prickle—too hot, too sharp. She jerks forward again, hugging her arms to her chest.

The butterfly lifts away, fluttering in a careless loop.

“Wh-what?” she stammers.

“You heard me.” The voice is smoke-thick, too deep for something so small. It circles once and then hovers just above her eye line, wings folding and unfolding as though it is bored already. “Hey-ho, princess.”

Mitzy licks her lips. Her tongue tastes of dirt. “I’m… not a princess.”

  

The butterfly dips as if shrugging. “Course you’re not. That’s why it’s funny.”

  

Her heartbeat is trying to dig its way out of her throat. She lifts one hand, palm out, the way she’s seen grownups calm dogs. “Butterflies don’t talk.”

  

The insect yawns—actually yawns—and it sounds like her Uncle Bart hacking through pipe smoke. “Sure we do. Just most of you don’t bother listening.”

  

Mitzy stares. Her mouth wants to say _this is a dream,_ but the hedge-thorns pressing into her shoulder still sting, and the damp dirt still coats her knee. This isn’t dream-soft.

  

The butterfly drifts closer until its antennae are a whisker from her nose. “What’s your name then, Not-a-Princess?”

  

She hugs her arms tighter. “Mitzy.”

  

“Mitzy.” It tastes the word like soup, then coughs. “Hnh. That’ll do. You can call me Larry.”

  

Mitzy blinks. “Larry? That’s not a butterfly name.”

  

“Better than ‘Toots,’” Larry says, and rubs his front legs together with a dry rasp that makes her scalp crawl.

  

Mitzy swats at him. He dodges neatly, laughing as he corkscrews back up into the green light.

  

Her voice comes sharper than she intends: “Why are you talking to me?”

  

Larry hovers, wings twitching. “Because you’re lost, princess. And because you’re about to find something sharp.”

  

Mitzy frowns. “Something sharp?”

  

Larry just grins—if butterflies can grin—and darts toward the corridor’s bend. “Come on. It’s waiting.”
