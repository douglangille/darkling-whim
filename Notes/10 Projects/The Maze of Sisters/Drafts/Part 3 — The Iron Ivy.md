Larry darts ahead, a quick streak of soot against the green.

Mitzy follows because there’s nothing else to follow—the Maze gives only one direction at a time. The air thickens, humid and mint-bitter. When she tries to breathe through her mouth it tastes like pennies and leaves.

  

“Keep up,” Larry calls. “It hates laggers.”

  

“It?” she pants.

  

“The Maze,” he says, like that should be obvious.

  

The corridor bends again, and sunlight leaks through in a single golden stripe, thin as a sword edge.  At its center juts an iron post, half-buried, its head worked with curling vines that mimic the hedges themselves.

  

Mitzy slows.  The metal sweats dew, or maybe something that only looks like it.  Her reflection slides along its dark length—eyes wide, skin ghost-pale, hair full of leaf bits.

  

Larry lands atop it and drums his forelegs. _Ping ping._

“Pretty, huh? Been waiting for you.”

  

Mitzy wipes her palms on her skirt. “For me?”

  

He nods toward the base where the earth splits slightly. “Grab hold.”

  

She hesitates.  The air hums, faint and electric, and the post trembles once as if eager.

  

“Go on,” Larry says, voice suddenly low. “It won’t bite. Yet.”

  

Mitzy wraps both hands around the shaft. The metal is cold enough to burn. She braces one foot, pulls, and the ground gives with a wet pop. The post slides free—a spear, longer than she is tall, ending in a squared ivy-leaf blade dark with age.

  

The weight settles into her arms like it remembers her.

  

Larry whistles. “Well look at that. Princess gets her wand.”

  

“It’s not a wand,” she mutters, testing the balance. The point gleams once in the stripe of sun.  She feels a small thrill—fear’s thinner cousin—run up her spine.

  

“That’s the spirit,” Larry says. “Every maze loves a weapon. Makes the ending tidy.”

  

Mitzy frowns. “What ending?”

  

But he only laughs, a dry fluttering sound that rattles through the hedges.
