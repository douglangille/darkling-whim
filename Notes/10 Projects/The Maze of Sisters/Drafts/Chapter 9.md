# Chapter 9 — The Return Path
## Part 1 — The Quiet Outside

The first thing June noticed was the wind.

Real wind. Cold, uneven, carrying salt and birdsong and the smell of grass after rain.

She lay on her back at the edge of a field that sloped toward a gray-green sea. The sky above her was the color of worn tin, streaked with white. A gull traced lazy circles high overhead.

For a long time she didn’t move. Her hands were dirty. Her shoes—yellow soles, scuffed—were damp with dew. When she finally sat up, her head spun; the horizon seemed too wide.

The Maze was gone. Behind her, where the boxwoods should have been, there was only a ring of bare earth, roots curling inward like fingers that had just let go.

June stood. Her voice came out small. “Mitzy?”

No answer.

The sea murmured below the cliffs. The air tasted clean and cruelly ordinary.

She looked down at her hands again. Under the grime, faint green veins glimmered in her wrists, like threads catching the light for an instant before fading. When she touched them, they pulsed once—soft, like the heartbeat of something sleeping.

June bit her lip. “You promised,” she whispered to no one.

The wind shifted, carrying a smell she hadn’t noticed at first—sweet, metallic, almost like honey burning in the back of a pan. Her stomach turned. “No. No, we’re out. We’re done.”

A shadow flickered across her feet. She looked down. A single black butterfly settled on her shoelace.

Its wings were frayed, edges dusted with silver, but its body gleamed faintly green in the middle—like moss under glass.

June crouched. “Larry?”

The butterfly tilted its wings once, as if nodding. Then it lifted off, circling her head twice before drifting toward the tree line inland.

June hesitated. Then followed.

## Part 2 — The Hollow Tree

The path down from the cliffs was easy at first—soft earth, wild grass, stones warm from the morning sun. The butterfly never hurried. It stayed just ahead, gliding low, sometimes vanishing between blades of grass only to reappear further up the hill.

June’s legs ached by the time she reached the tree line. The air changed again—cooler, still, thick with the smell of soil and sap.

The butterfly dipped between the trees, and she followed.

It wasn’t a forest she recognized. The trunks were too pale, their bark smooth as skin, no leaves overhead—only long, thin threads of green light hanging like vines. Each thread pulsed faintly, slow and even, like breathing.

“Mitzy?” June whispered.

The grove listened.

A few of the threads brightened in response, their glow washing the air with soft green. She reached out and touched one. It was warm, and it hummed faintly beneath her fingers.

The butterfly landed on her wrist. Its wings were almost translucent now, the veins tracing out a shape she half recognized—the Maze’s pattern, the one she’d traced on the kitchen table when they’d tried to map it from memory.

“Why bring me here?” she asked.

The butterfly didn’t move.

June looked past it, deeper into the grove. At the center stood a tree wider than the others, hollowed from within. Its bark gleamed faintly silver in the filtered light. Something pulsed inside it—a slow, steady rhythm.

She walked toward it. The closer she got, the stronger the hum became. Not menacing—just *familiar.*

When she touched the trunk, the pulse aligned with hers. And in that rhythm, she heard a voice—not loud, not spoken, but felt, the way a memory feels when it surprises you.

*Little sister.*

June’s throat closed. “Mitzy?”

The light within the hollow flickered once, then steadied. The pulse quickened.

*You found the way out,* the voice said. *Good.*

June pressed her palm harder to the bark. “Where are you? I can’t see you.”

*Everywhere.*

June stepped back. The butterfly left her wrist and flew into the hollow. Its wings caught the light, scattering it in patterns like ripples on water.

“Are you… the Maze now?”

The voice hesitated—then came softer, almost human again.

*No. The Maze was the wound. I’m what healed.*

June’s eyes filled. “You promised you’d come home.”

*I did,* said the voice. *You’re standing in me.*

## Part 3 — The Promise Kept

June leaned against the hollow tree, breath trembling between laughter and sobs. “I don’t understand,” she said. “If you’re here, if you *are* this… can’t you come back?”

The voice that was Mitzy breathed through the bark and soil, quiet as wind in tall grass.

*I tried once. It’s how the wound started. The Maze was made of wanting. When I stopped wanting, it stopped needing to feed.*

June pressed her forehead against the tree. “That’s not fair.”

*No,* said the voice, *but it’s peace.*

The butterfly had come to rest in the hollow now, its wings closing like hands in prayer. The light inside it dimmed, then steadied, pulsing with the same rhythm as the tree, as the ground, as June’s heart.

“You said you’d always look after me.”

*I am.*

“This isn’t the same.”

*It’s better,* said Mitzy. *Now you don’t have to be afraid of losing me. I’m everywhere you stand.*

June wanted to argue. She wanted to break the trunk open and drag her sister home by the wrist if she had to. But the grove was breathing with her, matching her heartbeat perfectly, and the air smelled like summer again—the real kind, not the Maze’s imitation.

She whispered, “What do I do now?”

*Live,* Mitzy said simply. *And if you remember me, remember me kindly. The Maze can grow again if you feed it grief.*

June wiped her face. “And you? You’ll sleep?”

*No. I’ll listen. The world needs someone to listen.*

The butterfly lifted from the hollow and circled June once before settling in her hair. Its wings brushed her ear—a touch so soft it felt like breath.

June closed her eyes. “Goodbye, Mitz.”

The pulse slowed. The glow inside the tree faded to a calm, steady green. The forest sighed—a long, content exhale—and went still.

June stood for a while, hand on the trunk, feeling its warmth soak into her skin. When she finally turned away, the roots shifted behind her, weaving into the soil until the hollow was gone, replaced by an ordinary tree with rough bark and shadows that didn’t move.

She stepped back into the field. The sea glittered beyond, gray and endless.

As she walked toward it, the butterfly rose into the sky and vanished into the light.
