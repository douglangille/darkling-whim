# Chapter 6 — The Chorus of Sisters
## Part 1 — Whispers in the Hedges

Mitzy left the room and didn’t look back.

There was no door anymore, only hedge—fresh, new, and wet-looking, as though the Maze had just grown over her memory to keep it warm.

The path ahead stretched in two directions that couldn’t possibly meet.  She picked one because it felt less sure of itself.

  

Larry floated ahead of her again, small, dark, quiet.  His silence felt heavier than his jokes ever had.

  

The corridor wound downward, the ground turning spongy.  The smell of dirt thickened, and the walls began to hum—a faint, tuneless vibration, like someone singing through a wall in another house.

  

Mitzy slowed.  “What’s that?”

  

Larry tilted his wings, listening.  “The Maze humming to itself.”

  

“It knows songs?”

  

“Only the ones it’s eaten.”

  

The humming grew louder as they walked.  Not one voice—hundreds.  Whispers running under one another until the words tangled.  At first she thought it was leaves moving in wind, but there was no wind here, and some of the whispers sounded like laughter, some like crying, some like hers.

  

She stopped.  “Larry… what is it?”

  

He didn’t answer right away.  Then, “The alumni association.”

  

She frowned.  “What’s that?”

  

“All the ones who came before.  The Maze doesn’t let good material go to waste.”

  

The whispers shifted as if hearing him.  A few rose above the rest, brief and desperate:

_“Find her.”_

_“Don’t turn around.”_

_“He’s still hungry.”_

  

Mitzy pressed her hands to her ears.  The sound didn’t stop.  It pressed through skin, humming behind her teeth.

  

“I can’t—make them—stop!”

  

“Can’t stop a choir, Princess,” Larry said.  “Best you can do is change the tune.”

  

“How?”

  

“Walk louder.”

  

She started forward, faster.  The voices swelled with her steps, harmonizing, matching her rhythm like a heartbeat under her own.  Some sounded her age.  Some sounded like mothers.  Some were no age at all.

  

When she passed a gap in the hedge, she caught glimpses between the leaves—shapes like faces, pale and still, lips moving in unison.  Eyes closed.  Or gone.

  

One of them looked almost like her.

  

Mitzy stumbled.  “Larry, they—”

  

“Keep walking.”

  

“I think they know me.”

  

“They _are_ you,” he said softly.  “Or close enough for the Maze to confuse the difference.”

  

The whisper nearest her ear sighed her name in chorus—_Mitzy-Mitzy-Mitzy_—each syllable overlapping the next until it turned into breathing again.

  

She didn’t run this time.  She just kept moving, slower, careful, eyes on Larry’s flicker of black ahead of her.

## Part 2 — The Carvings

The path dipped lower, until her boots sank in dark mud that clung like hands.  The walls leaned closer; their bases were bare of leaves, showing the Maze’s roots—thick cords of wood knotted into shapes that almost looked deliberate.

  

Mitzy paused.  At first she thought she saw bugs glinting on the bark.  Then she leaned in.

  

Not bugs.  Letters.

  

Someone had carved words into the exposed wood.  Names.  Dozens of them, etched with desperate strokes: _Mara. Elsie. June. Annelise._

She stopped at the third and touched it, half disbelieving.  The grooves were still sticky, like sap that hadn’t finished bleeding.

  

Larry hovered over her shoulder.  “Don’t touch, Princess.”

  

“It’s her name.”

  

“They all are.”

  

Mitzy looked closer.  The letters spiraled deeper along the root until the writing folded into symbols she didn’t understand.  Circles.  Spirals.  Little crown-shapes repeated over and over.

“How many?” she whispered.

  

“Enough to make a choir.”

  

“Who carved them?”

  

“Whoever the Maze still let move their hands.”

  

She pulled her fingers back, heart stuttering.  “They were all sisters?”

  

“Every one.”

  

The next root bore scratches instead of letters—a pattern of short lines, the kind she’d used to count down days on a wall once, when she’d been grounded for hiding June’s doll.

She traced the final mark.  It cut deeper, crooked, ending in a splinter.

  

“Larry,” she said, “I think they were counting time.”

  

He didn’t answer.

  

The whispering from before returned, soft, wet, almost affectionate.  The carved names quivered as if the voices came from inside the wood itself.

  

_Come find us._

_Find her._

_Finish it._

  

Mitzy backed away.  The nearest name shone briefly before the bark healed over, swallowing the letters whole.

  

Larry said, “That’s the Maze for you—never sentimental.”

  

Mitzy gripped the spear until her hands stopped shaking.  “I don’t want to end up a name on a root.”

  

“Then make sure someone else does first,” Larry said lightly, and flew on.

  

She stared at the place where the names had been.  The bark was smooth now, but she could still feel the grooves beneath her skin, ghost-deep.  When she finally moved to follow, one word echoed in her head, not from the Maze, but her own thought trying to sound like courage:

  

_Survive._

## Part 3 — The Relic

The ground levelled into a hollow slick with rainwater that had never seen sky.  The reflection on its surface was pale and wrong, a picture of leaves bending the wrong direction.

  

Mitzy stepped around it carefully.  Her boot touched something hard just beneath the skin of mud.  She crouched, scraping at it with her fingertips until she uncovered a shape.

  

A small, iron pendant.

Twisted into the rough outline of two girls hand-in-hand.

  

She wiped it clean on her sleeve. The iron smelled faintly of salt and old blood.

The figures’ faces were gone, worn flat.

But around the edge someone had carved words small as pin scratches:

**WE WALK TOGETHER UNTIL ONE STOPS.**

  

Larry drifted low, his wings stirring the puddle into circles.

“Souvenir?”

  

“It’s theirs,” she said.

  

“Yours now.”

  

Mitzy shook her head. “It feels… wrong.”

  

“Everything worth keeping does,” Larry said. “That’s how the Maze remembers who tried.”

  

She looked closer at the pendant.

A faint red shimmer pulsed through the grooves of the metal, fading in and out with her heartbeat.  When she turned it over, the back bore a second phrase:

**GOBLIN’S MARK.**

  

Her stomach dropped. “Larry… this isn’t just a trinket.”

  

He didn’t answer at first.  Then he said, “No.  It’s a contract.”

  

“A what?”

  

“Some sisters made deals.  Some didn’t.  Guess which kind still have voices.”

  

Mitzy held the pendant at arm’s length. “It belongs to one of them. I can’t keep it.”

  

“Sure you can.  You picked it up.”

  

“I don’t want it.”

  

“You think that matters?”

  

The puddle at her feet quivered.  A single bubble rose and popped.

For a moment, beneath the surface, she saw another hand—smaller than hers, reaching toward the pendant with a motion exactly matching her own.

  

She flung it down.

The pendant sank soundlessly into the water, the light dying with it.

  

Larry sighed.  “That was unwise.”

  

“Why?”

  

“Now it knows your name.”

  

The puddle darkened until it was just shadow.  From its center came a murmur, thin and low:

_Mitzy…_

  

Larry’s voice sharpened.  “Walk away.”

  

She ran.  The whisper followed, a ripple that moved under the path itself, echoing each of her footsteps like a heartbeat chasing her own.

## Part 4 — The Names in the Dark

The path dipped again, swallowing what little light the Maze pretended to have.

Mitzy’s breath came shallow, clouding the air in front of her even though it wasn’t cold.  The darkness had weight here.  Each step pressed through it like wading into tar.

  

Behind her, the puddle’s voice faded, but new ones rose to replace it.

Not whispers this time—**names**, spoken in careful rhythm, one after another.

She recognized none of them at first.  Then one hit her gut like a stone.

  

“June.”

  

Mitzy stopped dead.

  

The air hummed; the walls glowed faintly with veins of green light running under the leaves.  In that light, the roots and branches weren’t roots or branches anymore but **arms**, hundreds of them, reaching from inside the Maze.

Each hand held a pendant like the one she’d found.  Each pendant pulsed red, the rhythm steady, heartbeat slow and patient.

  

Larry came to rest on her shoulder.  “Don’t listen.”

  

“She said my sister’s name.”

  

“They all do eventually.”

  

“But—what if she’s—”

  

“She’s not.”

  

He said it quickly. Too quickly.

  

The arms stirred.  Some reached higher, their fingers curling in invitation.

Mitzy stepped back, but the whisper followed, breaking from the unison into overlapping pleas.

  

_Don’t stop._

_We walked too far._

_He’s still hungry._

_Finish what we couldn’t._

  

Larry hissed.  “Keep walking, Princess.  The dead get chatty when they smell company.”

  

Mitzy took one step backward.  The ground flexed.  Hands burst from the soil around her boots, thin and bark-skinned, clutching at her ankles.  She gasped and struck down with the spear.

The blade cut through one wrist.  Sap—no, blood—splattered warm against her shins.

  

The severed hand clung to the spear for a heartbeat longer before dropping.  The voice that had said _June_ screamed once and went silent.

  

Larry’s tone dropped to a near whisper.  “Now they know you bite.”

  

Mitzy trembled.  “They’re trying to pull me down.”

  

“They’re trying to make you stay.  That’s how they sing.”

  

The arms sank again, the last few brushing against her knees like reluctant children before disappearing into the soil.  The red light faded, leaving her and Larry alone with the dark again.

  

Mitzy wiped the spear tip clean on the hem of her skirt.  The smear glowed faintly for a moment, then dimmed.

  

“Larry?” she whispered.

  

“Yes, Princess?”

  

“Are they… gone?”

  

He hovered close, voice smaller than she’d ever heard it.  “No.  They’re just waiting for the refrain.”
