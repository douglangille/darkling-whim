Birdsong trickles down through leaves that knit the sky into tight green lace. 

Mitzy blinks. Her cheek is pressed to damp loam, her tongue is fur, and something sweet-rotten breathes from the hedges like old perfume left in a hot car. She pushes up to her elbows. Her knee slips in mud and plants a wet kiss on the ground.  

The hedges are wrong—too tall, too close, too neat in their wildness. Each leaf shines like it has opinions. Above, the canopy narrows to a coin of pale morning. She tests the air with a small, untrusting breath. The smell tastes like cut stems and penny-copper.

“My bed,” she says to the hedge, because there is no one else. The word comes out sandpaper-scratched. “My bed is… not here.”

She sits back on her heels and counts her fingers just to be sure they’ve all come along. Ten. Dirt moons under every nail. A mosquito whines near her ear; she flaps it away and the motion makes the world tilt for a second, a slow spin of leaf and light. When it steadies, her name blooms behind her eyes like someone wrote it there with a matchtip: Mitzy.

June, follows after, smaller.

She swallows hard. The swallow has edges.

The ground is littered with dry boxwood crumbs and a few pale berries like little teeth. She lifts one to sniff it and decides, solemnly, not to find out what it does. A narrow corridor runs left and right, hedge to hedge, floor of hard-packed dirt scored with faint grooves like something heavy was dragged along long ago and then again, later.

“Hello?” Her voice thins as it moves away from her, a ribbon pulled off a spool. The Maze eats it. No answer, just that water-bright birdsong somewhere too high to belong to this place.

A horsefly smacks the back of her neck. She slaps and misses. “Ow.” The sound is too loud; everything else is muffled, like the world is under a blanket and she isn’t.

She touches her hairline and finds a tender bump, a little mountain that wasn’t there yesterday—or maybe yesterday didn’t happen, maybe yesterday is folded up in somebody else’s drawer. She lowers her hand and stares at the smear of green where a leaf kissed her skin too hard.

“June?” she tries again, softer. The name seems braver when it’s small. She imagines her sister’s hand—warm, sticky from jam, always sticky—and her own hand not holding it.

Mitzy gets to her feet. The hedges make a throat around her and she is inside it. She takes one step. The leaves whisper against each other like they have secrets. She takes another step and the whispering stops, as if caught listening.

She tests the right-hand path with her toes and the dirt there is damp-cool, packed tight; the left-hand path breathes a faint, stale heat. She chooses the cooler air because it feels less like a mouth.

“Don’t be dumb,” she tells herself, and the hedges titter. She squares her shoulders and the tittering dies. Good.

A small hush falls, more serious than silence. Something moves in it—soft, deliberate, weightless.

A black butterfly drops out of the green like a burned petal and lands on Mitzy’s cheek, light as a lie.
