Mitzy plants the spear in the dirt and leans on it, breath huffing through her teeth. The air here feels heavier, syrup-thick with green. When she glances down, she notices a small placard hanging from the post’s hollow socket—something she hadn’t seen while pulling it free.

  

The sign swings lazily on two rusted chains.  Words are carved into it, not cleanly but gouged, as if by claws or a knife used too many times.  The letters shimmer for a heartbeat, then settle into sense.

  

**YOU HAVE ONE HOUR.**

**DON’T TOUCH THE WALLS.**

  

Mitzy frowns. “One hour for what?”

  

Larry flits closer, his wings clapping faintly in the damp air. “For it to decide what to do with you.”

  

“That’s not funny.”

  

“Wasn’t a joke.”

  

She presses her lips together. The sign creaks once and goes still, as though waiting for her to read it again.

  

“Don’t touch the walls,” she repeats. “What happens if I do?”

  

“Try it and find out,” Larry says, landing lightly on the top edge of the spear. “You’ll learn fast.”

  

Mitzy glares up at him. “You’re awful.”

  

“True,” he says cheerfully. “But useful. Keep me alive and maybe I’ll keep you the same.”

  

She ignores him and stares down the nearest corridor, where the hedges bow toward each other like two tall old ladies whispering. The light beyond them is dimmer, tinged green-black.

  

June’s face swims up in her memory—eyes bright with some secret, cheeks full of crumbs from the last piece of toast. The thought tightens her throat.

  

“I’m coming for you,” she whispers.

  

The Maze answers with a sigh. It could be wind. It could be breathing.

  

Mitzy lifts the spear, sets her shoulders, and steps into the shadowed corridor. The sign behind her twists on its chain and clinks softly, like a clock marking the first second gone.
