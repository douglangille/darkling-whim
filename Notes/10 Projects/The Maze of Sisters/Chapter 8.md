# Act IV — The Unmaking

# Chapter 8 — The Girl Who Stayed
## Part 1 — Afterlight

Silence settled like dust after rain.

For the first time since waking in the Maze, Mitzy couldn’t hear breathing—hers, the Maze’s, or anyone else’s. Even Larry was quiet, wings folded, perched on the end of her spear like a tiny flag at half-mast.

The air hung heavy with the scent of earth and smoke. The gold light that had soaked everything before was gone; what replaced it was dim, greenish—like light filtered through skin.

“Larry?” she whispered.

He tilted his head but didn’t answer.

The quiet pressed harder, shaping itself around her words until she felt them come back, muffled, as if the Maze were trying to repeat them under its breath.

“June’s out,” she said. “It let her go.”

Larry fluttered once. “It did what you told it to.”

“She’s safe.”

“That’s one definition.”

Mitzy turned in a slow circle. The corridor behind her was gone. Ahead stretched a single straight path, no bends, no mirrors, no choice. The walls were smooth now—no leaves, no roots—only pale, living bark. Every so often it twitched.

She touched it with the tip of her spear. The wall shivered like skin meeting cold metal. The vibration ran down the shaft, into her arm, through her chest. For a heartbeat, the Maze’s pulse matched her own.

“Larry,” she said quietly. “I think I can feel it breathing again.”

He didn’t move. “You don’t *feel* it, Princess. You *are* it.”

Her stomach dropped. “That’s not funny.”

“No,” Larry said, “it isn’t.”

The wall behind her flexed. She turned and saw the faint outline of a hand pushing out from the bark—small fingers, the shape of her own. Then another. Then dozens. The corridor filled with faint impressions, all reaching toward her, all *hers.*

“Make them stop,” she whispered.

“I can’t,” Larry said. “They’re memories. You’re blooming.”

The hands faded, leaving smooth bark again. The Maze sighed—soft, contented, alive.

Mitzy gripped her spear. “Then I’ll find a way to un-bloom.”

Larry finally met her gaze. His eyes were dark, reflective, carrying the faintest trace of sorrow. “If you un-bloom,” he said, “there’ll be nothing left to grow from.”

Mitzy lifted the spear and pointed it at her chest. “Then maybe that’s the point.”

The Maze shivered. The floor under her feet trembled once, like a heart skipping a beat. From somewhere deep in the roots below came a voice—soft, exhausted, and unmistakably her own.

*Don’t. We just learned how to live.*

## Part 2 — The Butterfly’s Choice

The air between them thickened. The smell of mint and iron returned—every scent the Maze had ever used to trick her, now faint, nostalgic, almost tender.

Mitzy stood still, spear point pressed to her sternum. Her hand didn’t shake. “Do it,” she said. “If I’m the Maze, then killing me ends it.”

Larry didn’t answer right away. He fluttered from the spear to her shoulder, his weight almost nothing. When he spoke, his voice had lost its rasp and its humor. “I’ve seen hundreds make that promise,” he said. “Every one of them thought they were different.”

“I am,” Mitzy said.

He gave a quiet, sad laugh. “That’s what they all said too.”

She turned her head toward him, eyes wet but steady. “Please, Larry. Don’t let it keep me.”

He looked past her, at the walls, which pulsed faintly with green light. The Maze had gone still—not retreating, not closing in—just watching. Every root and vein hummed softly, like a question.

“I can’t,” he said finally.

“Yes, you can. You said you were my guide.”

“I said I talk. I never said I save.”

Mitzy closed her eyes. “Then why follow me at all?”

“Because I wanted to see if you’d do what the others couldn’t.”

Her grip on the spear tightened. “And what’s that?”

“Stop fighting long enough to love something you hate.”

The Maze shuddered. The corridor flickered with light like breath catching in a throat.

Mitzy opened her eyes again, tired now. “Then you’ve seen it. You’ve seen enough.” She pressed the spear harder against her chest. “Do it.”

Larry landed on the spear haft. The Maze’s pulse quickened. The bark along the walls began to split, thin seams opening like eyelids. From each came a whisper:

*Don’t break what’s finally whole.*

Larry looked up at her face, and for a long moment, he didn’t look like a butterfly at all—he looked like a shadow caught between shapes. When he spoke, his voice was different—older, gentler, more human than insect.

“If I kill you,” he said, “the Maze dies. If I don’t, you stop being you. So which is mercy, Princess?”

Mitzy exhaled, slow. “You decide.”

The Maze trembled, leaves fluttering though there was no wind. The pulse grew louder, deeper, filling the air until it was hard to tell if it came from the walls or her own ribs.

Larry rose, wings spreading wide. The air around him shimmered—black turning to blue, then white. His voice echoed in every direction at once.

“I was made to talk,” he said. “But I can still sing.”

He sang.

It wasn’t a melody, not really—just a vibration that tore through the air like a note struck on both sides of silence. The walls convulsed. The bark split wider. Light poured out, green turning to silver.

Mitzy cried out. The spear fell from her hands. The Maze’s pulse broke rhythm—then stilled.

Larry’s glow dimmed. He drifted down, landing on her open palm. He looked smaller than ever, fragile, translucent.

Mitzy whispered, “Did it work?”

He didn’t answer.

The silence came back, but it wasn’t empty now. It was listening for something that hadn’t happened yet.

## Part 3 — The Root and the Wing

At first there was only light.

Not bright—just vast. A light with no edges, the kind that erases the idea of corners. It poured through the split bark, running in veins along the floor, threading through the roots that had once been walls.

Mitzy felt it in her chest, a spreading warmth that was almost pain. Every heartbeat went somewhere else—to the trees, the air, the earth. It wasn’t leaving her; it was dividing.

Larry’s body trembled in her hand. His wings looked thin enough to see through. The glow that had filled the Maze now came from him, not the walls.

Mitzy blinked through tears. “You—You’re dying.”

He laughed softly. “Not dying. Dispersing. Butterflies never die, Princess. They just remember different shapes.”

“I don’t understand.”

“That’s the closest anyone gets to understanding.”

She looked around. The walls were gone now. In their place stretched a vast, open grove—trees made of the same pale bark, roots glimmering with green light. The air smelled of rain and something clean, like the moment after lightning.

“It’s beautiful,” she said.

“It’s you,” Larry murmured. “The Maze without the hunger.”

Her breath caught. “Then I—”

“Yes,” he said. “You unmade it. Or remade it. Hard to tell which from this side.”

She looked down at him, his body dimming with each word. “And you?”

Larry tilted his head, his voice fading to a whisper. “I’m what’s left when the story finishes talking.”

The air shimmered; a single black wing detached from him, rising like smoke. The rest followed until he was gone, just a faint trail of ash and light that spun once, twice, and scattered into the canopy.

Mitzy stood alone.

The spear lay at her feet. When she picked it up, it felt lighter—less like a weapon, more like a branch waiting to grow.

Somewhere far above, she thought she heard birds again. Not the false, mirrored kind—the real ones.

The ground under her boots was still breathing, but slower now. Gentle. Alive, not hungry.

She closed her eyes. “If you’re still listening,” she said to the air, “let her stay free.”

The grove exhaled, and the whisper came back:

*She already is. You were the one who stayed.*

Mitzy’s knees gave way. She sank to the earth, the new roots cradling her as if they had always known her shape. Her breath came slow, steady, then matched the rhythm of the world around her.

For the first time, the Maze didn’t echo her name. It whispered it softly, like a prayer.
