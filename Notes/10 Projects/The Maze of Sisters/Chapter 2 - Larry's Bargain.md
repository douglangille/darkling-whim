## Part 1 — Larry's Mockery
The path narrowed to a cough of light between walls slick with dew.  Mitzy’s shoes made no sound on the dirt—too soft, like stepping on fur.  Larry drifted ahead, wings whispering, a moving blot in the green gloom.

  

“You’re quiet, Princess,” he called back.  “Thinking’s dangerous here.  The Maze can smell it.”

  

Mitzy tightened her grip on the spear.  “Stop calling me that.”

  

“What—Princess?” he asked, feigning shock.  “You don’t like it?  You seem the type.  You’ve got that whole chin-up thing.  Regal denial.  Classic princess move.”

  

“I’m not one.”

  

“Fine.  Not-a-Princess then.  Rolls off the tongue.  You should get it monogrammed.”

He dipped low enough that his shadow skated across her knuckles.  “Where’s June these days, anyway?  Still stealing your toys?  Still stealing your thunder?”

  

The words struck harder than thorns.  Mitzy kept walking.  “She’s lost,” she said.  “I’m finding her.”

  

Larry snorted, a small explosion of dust.  “Lost, huh.  That’s one way to put it.  Some sisters go missing.  Others get misplaced on purpose.”

  

“Shut up.”

  

He laughed softly.  “Touched a nerve.”

  

“I said shut up!”

  

Her shout hit the hedges like a stone in water.  Ripples ran through the leaves, and the whole corridor shivered.  A faint humming started somewhere deep inside the green, a heartbeat not hers.

  

Larry twirled above her head, pleased.  “See?  The Maze likes honesty.  Don’t worry—it only bites the liars.”

  

Mitzy clenched her jaw until her teeth ached.  “You don’t know anything about me.”

  

“Know enough,” he said, and suddenly he wasn’t joking.  “You think being the big sister makes you the hero.  It doesn’t.  It just gives you the sharper knife.”

  

She stopped walking.  “What did you say?”

  

Larry landed on a branch at eye level, wings closing like two black hands.  “Don’t look at me like that.  I’m just repeating what it tells me.”

  

“The Maze?”

  

He nodded.  “It remembers things.  Little things.  Who tripped who.  Who whispered what.  Who wished the other would just… disappear.”

  

Mitzy’s stomach turned cold.  “That’s a lie.”

  

“Then the Maze won’t mind hearing it again.”

  

He fluttered higher, out of reach.  “Come on, Princess-Not.  Keep up.  The walls move faster when you sulk.”

## Part 2 — First Hints of Jealousy

Mitzy followed because there was nowhere else to go.

The Maze pinched tighter, hedges closing like the pages of a book being read too fast.  A few thin beams of light speared through, green-edged and restless.

  

Larry floated backward in front of her, flying the way dust dances.  “Tell me about June,” he said, casual as a yawn.  “Was she the good one?”

  

“She’s—” Mitzy stopped.  The word wouldn’t shape right.  “She’s just June.”

  

“Ah,” Larry said, drawing out the sound like a violin string.  “_Just_ June.  The Maze loves that word.  It always comes before the bite.”

  

Mitzy glared at him.  “You’re trying to scare me.”

  

“Of course I am.  If I don’t, you’ll get sloppy and die.  Fear’s like caffeine here.”  He fluttered to her shoulder and clung to the fabric of her sleeve.  His feet were lighter than thought, but his voice pressed heavy in her ear.  “So, tell me.  Did you ever wish she’d stayed gone?  Even for a minute?”

  

Mitzy’s throat locked.  “No.”

  

Larry chuckled, wings brushing her cheek.  “The Maze says otherwise.”

  

She knocked him off with the back of her hand, harder than she meant to.  He spun once, caught himself midair, and looked almost delighted.

  

“There she is,” he said.  “A spark of truth at last.”

  

Mitzy’s breath came hot.  “I didn’t mean it.  She—she always—”

  

“—took what was yours?” he finished for her.  “Attention.  Toys.  Maybe love?”

  

Mitzy jabbed the spear’s butt into the ground.  The dirt shivered underfoot, rippling outward like water.  The hedges sighed, bending toward her.

  

Larry’s tone softened, just a little.  “Careful, kid.  The Maze hears tone better than words.”

  

“What’s that mean?”

  

“Means if you keep talking like that, you’ll end up sounding like me.”

  

He turned midair, his wings catching a sickly flash of light, and drifted deeper into the tunnel.  “Come on.  Goblins don’t wait forever.”

  

Mitzy stayed where she was, the spear trembling in her hands.  The ground still moved beneath her boots, slow and pulsing, like the Maze was breathing through her anger.

When she finally stepped forward, the walls whispered her name — soft, imitating Larry’s voice.

  

_Mitzy.  Mitzy.  Mitzy._

  

She walked faster.

## Part 3 — The Walls Respond

The corridor kept narrowing until Mitzy could feel the brush of leaves against her sleeves.  They whispered when she moved—tiny wet sounds, like lips tasting rain.

She tried to ignore it, but the hedges were breathing again.  She could _hear_ the rhythm if she matched her steps to it.

  

Breathe in.

Step.

Breathe out.

Step.

  

A leaf grazed her wrist and left a damp mark, the shape of a hand too small to be her own.

  

“Larry,” she called.  Her voice sounded thick, stuck in syrup.

No answer—just the faint clatter of wings somewhere ahead.

  

The spear weighed heavier now.  When she shifted it to her other hand, the ground beneath her feet rippled again, faint but deliberate.  The Maze was awake.

  

She stopped.  “I said—Larry!”

  

The whispering hushed.  A moment later, a thousand whispers answered all at once.  Her name again, layered and folding:

_Mitzy.  Mitzy.  Mitzy._

  

Each echo leaned closer until she couldn’t tell where they were coming from—above, behind, inside her.  The sound pressed against her skin like invisible hands.

She swung the spear in front of her, slicing air.  The voices broke into laughter.

  

“Not funny!” she yelled.

  

“Oh, I think it’s hilarious,” said Larry, gliding back from the dark.  His voice carried a grin she could hear.  “You’re finally in conversation with the place.”

  

Mitzy glared at him.  “Make it stop.”

  

“Can’t.  You started it.”

  

“What did I do?”

  

“You thought too loud.”

  

“That’s stupid.”

  

“Yep.”  Larry perched on a branch and folded his wings.  “Welcome to stupid country.”

  

The laughter of the Maze thinned to a giggle, then to breathing again.  Mitzy’s shoulders loosened, just barely.

  

“It talks like you,” she said.

  

Larry preened.  “Maybe I talk like it.”

  

She stared at him.  “That supposed to help?”

  

“Not particularly.”

  

Mitzy rolled her eyes, though the motion felt brittle.  “You’re the worst guide ever.”

  

“Funny thing about that,” Larry said.  “Guides don’t have to like where they’re going.”

  

He nodded ahead.  “Come on, Princess.  The Maze won’t wait forever.  And neither will the Goblin.”

  

Mitzy tightened her grip on the spear and stepped after him, but now every leaf she brushed against whispered her name as she passed, slow and pleased.

  

_Mitzy.  Mitzy.  Mitzy._

  

Each repetition sounded a little more like June.

## Part 4 — The Bargain Struck

The tunnel widened again without warning, opening into a shallow bowl of light.  Vines hung like ribs from the hedges, dripping pale sap that smoked when it hit the ground.  The smell was sugar and rust.

  

Larry coasted down until he floated just in front of her face.  “Breathe easy, Princess.  This is a rest stop.”

  

“I don’t need to rest.”

  

“Everyone needs to rest.  Some just don’t wake up afterward.”  He grinned.  “Kidding.  Mostly.”

  

Mitzy planted the spear in the dirt and sat.  The earth was warm.  She wiped sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand.  “You said there’s a Goblin.”

  

“There’s always a Goblin,” Larry said.  “Maze’s way of giving people something to blame.”

  

“What is it?”

  

“Depends who you ask.  Sometimes it’s teeth.  Sometimes it’s regret with claws.”

  

Mitzy frowned.  “You’re not helping.”

  

“I’m trying,” he said, tone softening for the first time.  “The Maze keeps its monsters custom-made.  But the rules stay simple:  find it, kill it, and maybe—_maybe_—you walk out with your heart still where you left it.”

  

“And June?”

  

“Ah, June.”  Larry’s wings beat once, stirring the sweet air.  “She’s in here somewhere.  Or something wearing her shape is.  Either way, you’ll meet her at the end.”

  

Mitzy’s throat tightened.  “How do you know?”

  

“Because the Maze told me.”

  

“That’s a lie.”

  

He tilted his head.  “Then we’ll find out which of us it likes better.”

  

She looked down at the spear.  The ivy carved along its length seemed to pulse, faintly breathing with her.  “If I find the Goblin and kill it, June goes home?”

  

Larry nodded.  “That’s the bargain.”

  

“And if I don’t?”

  

“Then you stay.  Maze needs someone to keep the candles lit.”

  

Mitzy rose.  “Fine.”  She lifted the spear.  “I’ll find it.”

  

Larry laughed, quiet and pleased.  “Good girl.”

  

“Don’t call me that.”

  

“Fine.  Good killer.”

  

She glared.  “Shut up.”

  

But he only twirled upward into the canopy, black wings slicing the light.  “Clock’s ticking, Princess-Not.  Let’s go earn that hour.”

  

The whisper came again from the hedges as she stepped forward:

_Mitzy.  Mitzy.  Mitzy._

Now it sounded almost like applause.
