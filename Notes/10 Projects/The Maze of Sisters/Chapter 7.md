# Act III — The Feast

# Chapter 7 — The Feast of the Goblin
## Part 1 — The Scent of Smoke

The air changed before the path did.

It grew heavy with sweetness, the kind that clings to the back of your throat until you can’t tell if you’re breathing or swallowing it. The green smell of leaves faded; what replaced it was roasted, faintly burnt—like sugar caramelizing, or hair.

Mitzy slowed. “What’s that smell?”

Larry didn’t answer right away. He was circling low, the tip of one wing grazing the dirt as if he were tasting the ground. When he spoke, it wasn’t with a joke. “Smoke,” he said. “And meat.”

She looked at him. “There’s a fire?”

“Or a kitchen,” he said. “Mazes love kitchens.”

“That’s not funny.”

“I’m not trying to be.”

The corridor sloped downward, each step sinking a little deeper. The light changed too—less green, more gold, flickering like candlelight through water. The hum that had haunted every other part of the Maze was gone now, replaced by silence so thick it seemed to press against her ears.

Mitzy tightened her grip on the spear. “Where’s it taking us?”

Larry gave a soft, distracted hum. “Smell it long enough, you’ll see.”

The gold light thickened into smoke that moved without wind. It curled around Mitzy’s ankles, tracing lazy patterns as she walked. Beneath it, the ground was warm.

Then she saw footprints—two sets, pressed deep into the dirt. One small. One smaller.

Her stomach twisted. “Larry,” she said. “These are hers.”

“Maybe.”

“They are. I remember her shoes—yellow soles. Look.”

The smaller prints glowed faintly, just for a heartbeat, as if answering her. The warmth underfoot pulsed brighter, and the smell of cooking grew stronger.

Mitzy’s voice dropped. “What’s it cooking?”

“Something that used to be lost,” Larry said quietly.

The corridor widened ahead, spilling light like an invitation. The smoke gathered thicker there, rising and falling with the sound of slow, wet breathing.

Mitzy glanced at Larry. “Is that—”

“The Goblin?” He twitched his wings once, uneasy. “If you have to ask, you’re close.”

She swallowed. “Then I’ll find June first.”

Larry’s eyes caught the gold light, glinting like coins half-buried in dirt. “Maybe she’s already found you.”

## Part 2 — The Banquet Hall

The passage opened like a throat widening for breath. Mitzy stepped through and felt the world’s shape change. The air was hot, wet, and smelled of iron and honey.

They stood inside a circular clearing ringed with boxwood so tall the sky was gone again. The walls gleamed—polished from smoke—and in their reflection, the gold light rippled like fire on metal.

At the center sat a long wooden table. Its surface was scarred with burns and carvings that almost looked like words. Platters covered it, stacked high with food that shimmered too much to be real: meats that steamed without heat, apples that bled clear syrup, bread breathing as though it had lungs.

And at the head of the table sat June.

She was clean, too clean. Her hair was brushed flat, her dress white as candlewax. Her hands were folded on her lap. Her eyes—gray-green like Mitzy’s—shone with the same golden reflection as the food.

“June,” Mitzy whispered.

The girl turned her head, slow and precise, as though the motion were learned. Her smile was small and exact. “You made it.”

Mitzy’s chest tightened. “We have to go. Now.”

June looked past her, eyes tracking Larry as he circled overhead. “Larry can’t help you,” she said. “He never could. He just talks.”

Larry’s wings faltered mid-beat. “That’s—fair,” he admitted.

Mitzy moved closer to her sister. “June, listen to me. This isn’t real. It’s the Maze playing tricks again.”

“Tricks?” June’s smile widened, showing teeth too sharp for her mouth. “No. It’s supper.”

Mitzy froze. “What?”

A shadow detached itself from the far end of the table. It wasn’t a man, not quite. The shape was close enough to fool you until you looked too long. Its limbs were a little too long, its posture a little too still. When it breathed, the sound came from behind its ribs instead of through its mouth.

The Goblin’s eyes were black hollows, each holding a flicker of gold—like candles burned to their last inch. Its voice came low, soft, almost kind.

“She’s been waiting.”

Mitzy took a step back, spear raised. “Get away from her.”

The Goblin tilted its head, studying her. “Why?” it asked. “You brought her here.”

“I didn’t!”

The Goblin smiled—small, dry, familiar. Larry flinched.

“Don’t,” he said under his breath.

Mitzy’s stomach turned. “Larry… it sounds like—”

“Don’t *say* it,” Larry hissed. “Don’t give it a name.”

The Goblin’s grin widened. “Names are dinner, little one.”

It gestured toward the table. “Eat. You’ve earned your place.”

Mitzy tightened her grip on the spear. “Where’s my sister?”

The Goblin leaned forward. “Right there,” it said, and pointed to June.

June’s small hand slid across the table and picked up a knife that gleamed too bright. She smiled at Mitzy, her voice soft and wrong. “Hungry?”

## Part 3 — The Invitation

June’s knife caught the gold light and turned it white. She held it the way a child holds a crayon—tight, but unsure what to draw.

Mitzy couldn’t breathe. Every inch of her screamed *run*, but her boots felt nailed to the ground.

The Goblin’s hand moved, pale and jointed too many times, tracing lazy circles over the table. “You should be proud,” it said. “Few make it this far still shaped like themselves.”

Mitzy’s voice came out hoarse. “What do you want?”

The Goblin’s smile flickered wider. “Want? *Want* is such a human word. I offer.”

Larry darted between them, his wings a dark blur. “Don’t listen, Princess. Every offer here has teeth.”

The Goblin ignored him. “You walked my paths. You bent my walls. You’ve earned what the others only begged for: a seat at my table, a taste of what you lost.”

“I don’t—”

“Don’t you?” it said. “You want her back.”

The Goblin gestured to June, who tilted her head, still smiling that clean, empty smile. “She’s right here. Memory made flesh. The Maze remembers what you can’t hold. All you need to do is eat.”

Mitzy’s eyes dropped to the table. The food looked real enough—roasted meat, the crusted edge of bread, a cup filled with something that smelled like apples and iron. Her stomach twisted, confused.

Larry’s voice came fast now. “Princess, don’t touch it.”

“I’m not going to,” she snapped.

The Goblin leaned closer. Its face was smooth, too smooth, but its smile moved like something alive under the surface. “Refusal tastes better,” it murmured.

“Why her?” Mitzy whispered.

“Because you dreamed her hungry,” it said. “Because you needed someone smaller than you to save.”

June’s fork scraped her plate—an awful, high sound that made Mitzy’s teeth hurt. “Sit with me,” June said. “I saved your place.”

Mitzy shook her head. “You’re not real.”

June’s face twitched—just once—and for the first time, she looked scared. “I know,” she said softly. “But if you leave me, I stop being even that.”

The Goblin’s laugh rustled through the Maze like dry leaves. “Every feast needs mercy,” it said. “Go on, girl. Show her yours.”

Mitzy’s hands shook. She lifted the spear, pointing it at the table. “You’re lying.”

“Always,” said the Goblin. “But lies are the closest truth to wanting.”

The Maze around them pulsed, the gold light deepening to red. Roots crept from the walls, curling around the table legs like vines around prey.

Larry whispered, almost pleading now. “Decide fast, Princess. The room’s getting hungry.”

Mitzy met June’s eyes—those mirrored eyes—and whispered, “I’m not eating.”

The Goblin tilted its head, amused. “Then you’ll be eaten remembering her.”

## Part 4 — The Turning of the Table

The Goblin clapped once.

It didn’t sound like skin meeting skin. It sounded like two stones grinding together underwater.

The table shuddered. Every plate trembled, every cup spilled. The air filled with the smell of smoke and rot and something too sweet to be kind.

Mitzy stepped back, dragging June with her, but the Maze leaned forward. The hedges pressed in, leaves unfolding like mouths, each whispering the same word in different tones.

*Eat.  
Eat.  
Eat.*

The roasted meats on the table split open. Not flesh—*faces*. Eyes blinked from the crust of bread, lips gasped through the apple skins. The voices came thin and layered, singing the same terrible note of hunger.

June screamed. The sound was small and real and human, and it almost undid Mitzy right there.

Larry swooped low, shouting, “Don’t look, Princess! It’s only showing you what you want to save!”

But Mitzy *did* look. And saw her own reflection in every dish—dozens of Mitzys, each older, smaller, angrier, kinder—each frozen in the act of reaching for someone they loved.

“What is this?” she cried.

The Goblin rose. Its body unrolled like paper soaked in water, limbs too many, joints too few. When it spoke, the sound came from every mouth on the table, every whisper in the wall, every echo of her name she’d ever left behind.

“This,” it said, “is remembering. The Maze eats what you can’t hold.”

Mitzy dragged June behind her. “You can’t have her.”

“She’s already given,” said the Goblin. “All that’s left is the flavor you add.”

The walls swayed; the air tasted of metal. The spear in Mitzy’s hands hummed—an iron note that cut through the noise like lightning splitting sky. Larry hissed, “Whatever you do, do it *now*.”

Mitzy raised the spear high and drove it through the table. The wood screamed. Light burst from the crack—a flood of white so bright it erased everything for a heartbeat.

When her vision cleared, the table was gone. The food, the plates, the Goblin—*gone*.

Only June remained, sitting on the floor, trembling. Her eyes were hers again.

“Mitzy,” she whispered.

Mitzy ran to her, kneeling, taking her by the shoulders. “We have to move. Now.”

But June’s gaze wasn’t on her. She was looking past Mitzy, at the floor where the spear had pierced it.

The ground there pulsed faintly, still glowing at the edges of the wound. A voice rose from that light—soft, familiar, and tired.

*You taught it how to bend.*

Mitzy’s stomach turned to ice.

Larry hovered above them, silent. Even he looked afraid.

The whisper came again, everywhere at once.

*Now it bends for you.*

## Part 5 — The Escape That Isn’t

Mitzy pulled June to her feet. “Run.”

June didn’t argue. They bolted, the Maze parting just enough for them to believe it wanted them gone.

The corridors blurred past—tunnels of root and gold light, walls breathing faster than lungs should. The ground flexed beneath them, each step sinking and rising as if the Maze was moving with their pace.

Behind them, the voice of the Goblin rode the air like distant thunder: *You wanted her safe. Now she is. Inside you.*

Mitzy gritted her teeth and ran harder. “Ignore it. It’s just noise.”

Larry kept pace, a streak of shadow beside them. “Princess, it’s never *just* noise.”

The walls pulsed, responding to her heartbeat. When she turned left, the corridor stretched that way; when she flinched from a flicker of light, the hedge recoiled. The Maze wasn’t chasing anymore. It was *following.*

June stumbled, dragging Mitzy down with her. They hit the dirt. The walls leaned in like curious faces.

Mitzy rolled onto her knees, clutching her sister. “It’s okay. It’s okay, I’ve got you.”

June’s voice was small. “It listens to you.”

“No. It’s—”

“It *moves* when you tell it to.”

Mitzy froze. The leaves nearest her quivered, waiting. She felt it then—the thin hum of the Maze’s pulse, tuned perfectly to her own. She didn’t move, didn’t breathe. The air around her waited too.

Larry landed between them, wings low. “You see it now, don’t you?”

“Make it stop.”

He laughed softly, almost sorry. “You can’t unteach what you’ve taught. You showed it how to listen.”

The hedge to her right rustled, then peeled open like a curtain. Beyond it, she saw flashes of daylight—the first real light she’d seen in forever.

June gasped. “Home!”

Mitzy grabbed her wrist. “Wait—”

June wrenched free, bolting toward the opening. Mitzy lunged after her.

The light flared brighter—and vanished.

Where the exit had been, there was only more hedge, still dripping with golden sap. The Maze had closed its mouth.

Mitzy turned on Larry, shaking. “It’s playing with us.”

“It’s learning affection,” he said softly. “You taught it mercy. Now it wants to keep you.”

“I don’t want to stay!”

The walls leaned closer, almost tender.

Larry’s voice dropped to a whisper. “That’s what they all said right before it loved them back.”

Mitzy pressed her palms to the dirt, breath shaking. “If it listens, then it can *hear* me.”

“Princess—”

She shouted at the Maze. “Let her go!”

The ground pulsed once. The wall behind June shivered. Then, without sound, the Maze obeyed. A seam opened. June stumbled through it—and was gone.

The seam sealed shut again before Mitzy could follow.

“June!” she screamed.

No answer.

The air stilled. Larry’s wings barely moved. “Congratulations,” he said quietly. “You’re the Maze now.”
