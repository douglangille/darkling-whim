# Chapter 3 — The First Bending
## Part 1 — Circles

_Echo:_ _Mitzy. Mitzy. Mitzy._ The whisper followed like polite clapping that wouldn’t stop.

  

The sound rode her shoulders as she walked, soft as moth wings, patient as rain. Larry drifted ahead, a soot-flake that refused to land. The corridor looked ordinary at first—dirt floor, boxwood walls sweating green—but the ordinary kept rearranging itself when she blinked, like a picture someone couldn’t decide how to hang.

  

Mitzy stepped over a fallen twig with a split end like a snake’s tongue. Ten paces later she stepped over the same twig again. She recognized the muddy crescent of her own boot print beside it, already drying at the edges.

  

“Larry,” she said.

  

“Mmm?” He didn’t look back.

  

“We were here.”

  

“Every minute,” he said lightly. “You’re just catching up.”

  

She scowled at his back and kept going. Left bend, short straight, shallow dip where the dirt held a darker seam. She counted—one, two, three—turned right, and met the twig for the third time. The Maze pretended it had never seen her before, and the pretence made her teeth ache.

  

“Stop it,” she told the path.

  

It stopped. That is, it paused just long enough for her to wonder if stopping meant winning, and then it offered the same shallow dip with a little extra tilt, as if the Maze had cocked its head.

  

Mitzy set the butt of the spear on the ground, hard. The shock went up her arms the way laughter sometimes does when you’re not supposed to laugh. Birds were singing far above, the same tune as before, but the notes fell in a new order, and that made the song feel wrong.

  

“Tell me it’s a trick,” she said. “Say there’s a mirror. A loop. Say something that makes sense.”

  

Larry angled back toward her in a lazy figure-eight. “All mazes are loops. This one just likes to brag about it.”

  

“That isn’t helpful.”

  

“Helps me,” he said.

  

Mitzy crouched and touched the mud. Her earlier boot print fit her toes like a mold. A line dragged through the dirt nearby—long, shallow, a mark she didn’t remember making. She traced it to a scuffed place where something heavy had turned. For a breath she could see it: a girl her size pulling an iron post from the ground, the blade kissing air, the weight dragging a scar.

  

“Was that me?” she whispered.

  

Larry hovered lower until his shadow crowned her head. “If you don’t like the answer, pick a better question.”

  

She stood. The corridor ahead was the same corridor ahead. She hated it for acting clever. “Fine,” she said to the hedge. “Let’s see how clever.”

  

She took the left bend and kept her eyes on the seam where wall met floor. She counted the breaths between the birds’ falling notes. She dragged the spearpoint just enough to leave a bright line along the dirt—thin, shining, proof. At the shallow dip she tilted the blade and carved an X. When the path turned right, she didn’t. She pushed into the leaves instead, not touching—she remembered the sign—but close enough to feel their cold breath on her arms.

  

The hedge hissed, offended. She eased back onto the corridor before it could decide what to do about her. Ten paces. The twig. The boot print. The X she carved, waiting like a smirk.

  

Mitzy’s throat tightened. “No.”

  

The Maze purred. It wasn’t a sound so much as a pleased loosening under her feet, as if the ground had smiled.

  

Larry clicked his tongue. “Princess-Not, meet your own orbit. Your orbit, meet the Princess.”

  

“I’m not orbiting,” she said, but the word came out thinner than she wanted. She set off again, faster. The corridor obliged, unspooling like ribbon, happy to be chased.

  

Left bend, dip, right bend, twig, X. Left bend, dip, right bend, twig, X. Mitzy’s breath came faster. The hedges leaned in like old women eager for gossip. She tried a new game—backwards steps, eyes closed for three heartbeats, point the spear at the exact center of her sternum and pivot left on the heel. When she opened her eyes, the twig waited, tongue split and laughing.

  

“Larry.” It was a warning this time, and a plea.

  

He gave a small, approving hum. “Now you’re speaking its language.”

  

“I’m speaking _angry_.”

  

“Same dialect.”

  

Mitzy planted the spear, chest heaving. The applause-whisper of her name had thinned to a steady murmur, the way a crowd sounds when it thinks you’re about to perform.

  

She looked up. The coin of sky still hung there, pale and careless. Something about that calm edge above made the corridor’s sameness feel like mockery.

  

“I’m not your joke,” she said to the Maze. “Find someone else.”

  

The leaves rustled, pleased that she’d said anything at all. The path ahead brightened by a hair, as if the Maze had leaned back to get a better look at her.

  

Mitzy wiped her palms on her skirt and set the spear across her shoulders, the way she’d seen men carry tools when they wanted to show they weren’t tired. She took one more step and felt the unseen circle tilt underfoot, just slightly, like a plate being slid from a table without the glasses falling.

  

“Did you feel that?” she asked.

  

Larry’s wings slowed, the air around him quivering like heat over stone. “Oh, it felt you,” he said. “Keep going.”

  

Mitzy did. The twig stayed where it was. The X did not. Somewhere between one breath and the next, the X had gone faint, as if the Maze were swallowing the line she’d drawn into its tongue.

  

She swallowed too, because her mouth had gone dry. “If I’m the loop, then I can unloop.”

  

“That’s the spirit,” Larry said. “All you have to do is stop being you.”

  

Mitzy stared at the bend that waited like a suggestion. “How hard can that be,” she said, and took it.

---

## Part 2 — Pressure

The bend didn’t open into new ground.

It curved inward, tighter, like something had inhaled and forgotten how to exhale.

  

The air thickened with the smell of sap and heat. Each breath scratched her throat.

Leaves brushed her arms; their undersides were wet and cool, and when they touched her skin, she felt a faint pulse—tiny heartbeats that didn’t belong to her.

  

Mitzy stopped. “It’s closer.”

  

Larry landed on the spear haft, wings half-open. “No, Princess. You’re bigger. The Maze doesn’t like that.”

  

“I’m not bigger.”

  

“You think louder, same thing.”

  

She turned in a circle. The corridor was now a narrow green throat, the walls bowing toward her like they wanted to whisper something directly into her bones.

She raised the spear. The blade caught a trickle of light and gleamed—a fragile thing pretending to be brave.

  

“Back up,” she said. “Give me room.”

  

The hedges didn’t.

They breathed.

  

The sound wasn’t wind. It was the slow draw of lungs, the creak of branches bending inward.

Mitzy could see the leaves tremble, the stems straining toward her face like reaching fingers.

  

“Stop it!” she shouted.

  

The Maze sighed in answer.

And moved.

  

A long shudder ran through the corridor. The walls pressed closer until she could feel their damp chill against her shoulders. A branch snagged a thread of her hair and pulled.

  

Larry hovered above her head, circling once. “Told you not to think so loud.”

  

“I’m _not_ thinking!” she snapped.

  

“Ah. There’s your problem—you’re feeling instead.”

  

“Then make it stop!”

  

“Can’t,” he said. “You started the dance.”

  

She swung the spear sideways. The tip brushed the leaves but didn’t touch them—she remembered the warning—but even that nearness made the Maze twitch.

The sound it made wasn’t pain, exactly. More like surprise.

Mitzy took another step back and her heel sank into the mud. It sucked at her boot like a mouth.

  

“Larry!”

  

“I’m here,” he said, though his voice came from behind her now. “Don’t panic.”

  

The mud climbed her ankle. The walls breathed again, closer, closer still.

  

Mitzy fought for a deep breath and said through her teeth, “I’m not scared.”

  

The Maze’s pulse quickened.

Leaves quivered, roots flexed beneath the dirt.

  

“Say that again,” Larry whispered.

  

“I’m not—”

  

The ground lurched.

A sound tore through the air, part groan, part laugh.  The hedges bent back, then forward again, snapping into a new shape so fast she stumbled.

When she looked up, the corridor was different.

The sky above had vanished.  The path now spiraled downward, smooth and damp, lit from beneath by a green glow that throbbed with her pulse.

  

Mitzy swallowed hard. “What did it just do?”

  

Larry landed lightly on her shoulder. His voice was soft now, stripped of its usual mocking edge.

“It bent,” he said. “You taught it how.”

  

Mitzy looked around—the twisted passage, the slick green light, the living air that knew her name.

Her whisper barely made it past her lips.

“Then what’s it going to do next?”

  

Larry didn’t answer.

  

He just nodded toward the spiral.

“Depends on what you’re about to feel.”

---

## Part 3 — The Spiral

The spiral coiled ahead like a shell turned inside out.

Its walls were smoother than before—no leaves now, only glistening skin the color of new moss. Light pulsed under the surface, a rhythm that didn’t match her heartbeat but wanted to.

  

Mitzy stepped onto the slope. The air was thicker here, heavier, as if she’d walked underwater without noticing. Each breath tasted like mint and copper.

  

Larry followed, wings brushing her cheek. “Slow down. Mazes hate impatience.”

  

“I want out.”

  

“Everyone does. It’s what keeps them walking.”

  

Mitzy took another step. The floor flexed beneath her boots, soft as wet paper. She lifted her foot and saw the faint print it left behind glowing briefly before fading. She imagined she could hear the Maze sigh in satisfaction, like it had been waiting for her to leave her mark.

  

The tunnel tightened. She had to angle the spear sideways to keep moving.

Something about the curve made her dizzy; it wasn’t just turning downward—it was turning **around her**, folding her in its geometry.

She felt the world bend and realized it wasn’t just the path. It was her.

  

Her thoughts kept doubling back. Every time she tried to picture June’s face, it slipped into her own.

The two faces twisted together until she couldn’t tell whose memory she was holding.

She stopped walking and pressed her forehead against the spear’s cold shaft.

  

“Larry,” she whispered. “I can’t remember her voice.”

  

He hovered in front of her, wings flickering faint blue in the half-light.

“Memory’s just another wall, Princess. Push too hard and you flatten what’s behind it.”

  

“But if I forget her—”

  

“You won’t,” he said, and for once the sarcasm fell away. “The Maze remembers for you.”

  

She looked up. “That’s supposed to help?”

  

“No,” he said. “It’s supposed to scare you into walking.”

  

Mitzy kept moving. The spiral steepened, each curve tighter than the last.

The glow under the floor thickened to a heartbeat, slow and patient.

It felt like walking across the inside of a giant lung. The air moved with her steps.

  

At the curve’s next turn, she saw motion ahead—her own silhouette, seconds delayed, rounding the bend before her.

  

“Larry?”

  

“Yes, Princess.”

  

“Is that… me?”

  

The butterfly tilted. “Depends which of you asks first.”

  

Her shadow turned to face her.

Mitzy froze.

  

The shape smiled—a thin, knowing grin she didn’t recognize—and mouthed something she couldn’t hear.

  

The walls leaned closer, eager to listen.

  

Mitzy’s spear trembled in her hands. “It’s saying something.”

  

“Don’t answer,” Larry said quickly.

  

But she already had.

  

“I can’t hear you,” Mitzy whispered.

  

Her shadow blinked, and its eyes opened into light.

---

## Part 4 — The Lesson

Her shadow blinked again, light pouring from the sockets like water through cracks.

The glow sloshed across the spiral walls, staining them bright green, until Mitzy could see herself—_herself_—standing just ahead, as solid as breath in cold air.

  

Same clothes. Same spear. Same dirt smudge on the chin.

But the other girl’s eyes glowed steady where Mitzy’s trembled.

  

“Hello?” Mitzy managed.

  

The copy tilted her head. “Hello.”

It sounded right and wrong at once—her own voice turned inside out, scraped clean of fear.

  

Larry’s voice dropped low behind her. “Princess. Step back.”

  

Mitzy didn’t move.

The copy smiled. “It bends when you breathe,” she said. “When you think too loud. When you try not to feel.”

  

“Who are you?”

  

“You know,” the copy said. “You made me when you needed someone to hate.”

  

Mitzy gripped the spear. “I don’t hate anyone.”

  

The spiral shivered.  The air around her warped; roots pushed through the walls, slick and trembling, weaving a new pattern.

  

The copy’s grin widened. “You hate me,” she said, and her voice thickened with joy. “That’s enough.”

  

“Larry,” Mitzy whispered. “Tell me it’s lying.”

  

“It doesn’t know how,” Larry said. “Only how to echo.”

  

The copy stepped closer. The Maze folded with her, shrinking the space between them. Their spears crossed, tip to tip, metal humming.

  

“Put it down,” Mitzy said.

  

“You first.”

  

They moved at the same time, circling.

Each shift of Mitzy’s feet was mirrored perfectly, the spiral tightening around them until it felt like they were dancing inside a heartbeat.

  

“You’re not real,” Mitzy said again, but the words broke halfway through.

  

“Then why do I bleed when you say that?”

  

The Maze answered before Mitzy could: a low groan, followed by the deep crack of earth splitting.  The spiral tilted, spilling her sideways into her own reflection.

For one heartbeat they were the same—skin against skin, breath matched, anger and fear indistinguishable.

  

Then it was gone.

The other Mitzy dissolved into light that sank through the floor, leaving only her own voice echoing back, thinner now, almost tired.

  

_You needed someone to hate._

  

The floor steadied.  Larry dropped to her shoulder, his weight lighter than usual.

  

“Well,” he said softly, “now it knows your taste.”

  

Mitzy wiped her face with the back of her hand. It came away damp and green. “What does that mean?”

  

“It means,” Larry said, “the Maze has learned a new shape.”

  

She looked down. The walls were breathing again, slow and deep. Each exhale bent the path outward, widening it, as if the Maze were stretching after a long nap.

  

“What shape?”

  

Larry’s voice held something like pity. “Yours.”
---

## Part 5 — The Exit That Isn’t

By the time they found another clearing, the light had turned gray. Ahead lay an archway draped in vines, the closest thing to an exit she’d seen. Beyond it was white light—daylight, maybe.

Mitzy started toward it.

Larry darted in front of her. “Don’t.”

“Why not?”

“Because it’s never that easy.”

She took another step. The air near the arch shimmered. Within it, she saw June again, smiling, hand outstretched. “Come on, Mitz,” said the illusion. “We can go home.”

Mitzy hesitated. “Larry—”

“It’s bait,” he said.

“But what if—”

“Then she’ll still be there after you don’t touch it.”

Mitzy swallowed hard. The longing in June’s voice hurt. “I can’t tell what’s real anymore.”

Larry landed on the spear, his voice low. “That’s the point.”

Mitzy turned away from the arch. As soon as she did, it vanished, leaving only another wall of boxwood.

Larry said nothing. Neither did she.

They walked on until the path faded into darkness.

---

## Part 6 — The First Night

When she finally stopped, she was too tired to cry. She lay on the ground, clutching the Iron Ivy across her chest like a lifeline. The Maze breathed around her, soft and slow.

Larry perched on a branch above. “You did well,” he said quietly.

“I don’t feel like I did.”

“That’s how you know you’re still human.”

She looked up at him, eyes heavy. “Do you ever sleep?”

“Someone has to keep watch.”

“Against what?”

He didn’t answer. Instead, he began to hum—a low, strange melody that seemed to come from the air itself. It wasn’t comforting, exactly, but it was steady, and it filled the spaces where fear might have fit.

Mitzy closed her eyes.

The Maze bent closer, listening.
