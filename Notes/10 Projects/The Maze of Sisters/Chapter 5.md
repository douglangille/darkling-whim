# Chapter 5 — The Sister’s Room
## Part 1 — The Door That Shouldn't Be

The corridor pinched, then widened again so suddenly that Mitzy had to blink against the light.

It wasn’t green this time. It was _yellow_ — pale, dusty, the colour of late afternoon coming through curtains.

  

The air smelled wrong for the Maze: detergent, soap bubbles, the faint sugar of oatmeal cookies burned around the edges.

She stopped walking.

  

Ahead, the hedges flattened into a wall not of leaves but of painted wood — white, with a doorknob shaped like a glass marble she half-remembered from somewhere that used to be safe.

  

Larry perched on her shoulder. “Oh,” he said quietly. “That trick again.”

  

Mitzy’s throat closed around the words. “That’s— That’s _my house._”

  

“Is it?” Larry asked. “Or does the Maze just like your taste in décor?”

  

She reached for the knob before she could think better of it. The glass marble under her fingers was cool and solid. When she turned it, the door swung inward on the smell of dust and the sound of wind chimes that shouldn’t exist in a hedge.

  

Inside was her room.

Not a copy. Not a memory. _Her_ room.

Pink lamp shade. Crooked poster. The stuffed rabbit with the missing ear sitting exactly where she’d left it two summers ago.

Even the crack in the windowpane had the same spider-shape she’d traced a hundred times when she couldn’t sleep.

  

Mitzy stood in the doorway, heart hammering. “This isn’t real.”

  

Larry stayed in the threshold, wings folded. “That depends who you ask. Memory’s the Maze’s favorite building material.”

  

The rabbit fell over by itself.

## Part 2 — The Ghost of June

  

The stuffed rabbit lay face-down on the carpet, one limp paw twitching in the small draft that came from nowhere.

Mitzy stared at it. She didn’t remember leaving the window open. She didn’t remember the Maze _having_ wind.

  

“June?” Her voice came out in the soft, singsong tone she used when they played hide-and-seek and she was pretending not to cheat.

  

No answer.

Just the sound of something light scraping along the desk—pencil, maybe—and the tick of the lamp chain moving back and forth though nobody had touched it.

  

She stepped inside. The carpet had that same worn spot by the bed where she’d paced the week June got sick. The smell of dust was stronger now, layered with something sweeter. Strawberry shampoo.

June’s shampoo.

  

Her chest hurt. She turned in a slow circle.  Everything looked right until she reached the dresser.

The top drawer was open.

  

Inside, neatly folded, were June’s clothes: the striped pajamas, the purple hoodie with the too-long sleeves.

And in the middle—folded like an offering—was one of June’s drawings. Two stick girls holding hands under a yellow sun.

The taller one wore a crown.

  

Mitzy touched the paper. The wax crayon bled onto her fingertip as if the picture were still wet.

  

Behind her, Larry cleared his throat.

“She’s been redecorating,” he said. “You should feel flattered.”

  

Mitzy turned on him. “Why are her things here? This is _my_ room.”

  

He landed on the bedpost, wings barely moving. “Because she’s still your mirror. The Maze likes keeping twins in tidy pairs.”

  

“She’s not my twin.”

  

“Close enough,” he said. “You both dream in the same shapes.”

  

Mitzy looked back at the drawing. The crown on her stick figure’s head glowed faintly, like sunlight remembered.

“Where is she, Larry?”

  

He tilted his head, the movement almost birdlike. “Depends. How much of her do you want to find?”

  

The air thickened; dust motes drifted slower.  The closet door clicked open on its own.

Inside hung a row of clothes—small, bright, too clean—and between them, in the dark, something breathed once, shallow and fast.

  

Mitzy raised the spear.

“June?”

  

A small voice answered from the closet.

“Why did you leave me?”

## Part 3 — The Voice in the Closet

Mitzy froze.

The voice wasn’t exactly June’s—it was thinner, hollowed out, as if spoken through a seashell.

Her fingers tightened on the spear shaft until her knuckles ached.

  

“I didn’t,” she said. “You ran. I tried to—”

  

“You didn’t look,” the voice interrupted, still soft, but close enough that it vibrated through the air.

The hanging clothes swayed gently, brushing against one another like leaves in a windless forest.

  

Mitzy took a step closer. The scent of strawberry shampoo hit harder now, layered with something else: damp earth, the smell of the Maze beneath all the soap and memory.

She pushed one sleeve aside. Then another. The closet’s dark deepened.

  

“June?”

  

“Why did you wish it?”

  

Mitzy’s mouth went dry. “Wish what?”

  

“To be alone.”

  

“I didn’t.”

  

“You did,” the voice said. “You said it under your breath, the night I broke your toy horse. You said you wished I’d never—”

  

“Shut up!” Mitzy yelled, thrusting the spear into the closet.

  

The metal hit nothing at first, then caught on something soft.  A sound like exhaling.  The darkness folded inward.

All at once the closet emptied—no clothes, no air, no voice—just a long hollow that smelled like turned soil.

  

Mitzy staggered back, heart pounding.

Behind her, Larry said, very quietly, “You’re not supposed to answer it, Princess. The Maze loves when you answer.”

  

“I didn’t know what else to do.”

  

“Not knowing is safer.”

  

The rabbit rolled across the floor and stopped at her boot, its one glass eye staring up at her.

Mitzy looked down. The fur around its mouth was wet.

  

She wanted to ask what that meant, but Larry had turned away. He was watching the window.

Beyond the glass, the world had changed: no sky now, just hedge pressing against the pane, leaves flat and glistening like skin.

  

Mitzy whispered, “Where’s the door?”

  

Larry didn’t look back. “It left when you came in.”

  

The bed creaked.

Mitzy turned, slowly.

  

Someone was sitting there—small, cross-legged, hair tangled, head bowed.

  

It was June. Or something wearing her face.

## Part 4 — The False Sister

June raised her head.

Her eyes were wrong.

Not in color—they were the same gray-green—but in how still they were.  June’s eyes had always darted, hungry for what came next.  These didn’t blink at all.

  

“Hi, Mitzy,” she said.  The voice came clean and warm, exactly as it should, except for the small gap between each word—as if something else had to translate before speaking.

“I missed you.”

  

Mitzy’s throat squeezed tight. “June?”

  

The girl on the bed smiled.  “Don’t sound so surprised.  You came back for me.”

She swung her feet once, the heels tapping the bedframe like a ticking clock.

  

Mitzy’s eyes darted to the spear resting against her leg.  “You’re not real.”

  

June’s smile thinned.  “Neither are you, not anymore.  You’ve been gone a long time.”

  

“I was looking,” Mitzy said.

  

“For me?  Or for what you lost?”

  

Mitzy took a step back.  “Stop it.”

  

Larry flitted between them, circling the false June in cautious loops.  “Careful, Princess.  Some reflections climb out of their mirrors.”

  

June’s gaze snapped toward him.  “You talk too much.”

The air crackled.  Larry dropped half an inch, wings stuttering.  He managed a small laugh, but it was thin.  “Oh, she’s learning tricks now.  That’s adorable.”

  

Mitzy couldn’t look away from her sister.

June looked the same in every detail, down to the chipped nail polish, but the air around her pulsed faintly—as if she were being projected through water.

  

“Why are you here?” Mitzy asked.

  

June tilted her head.  “You brought me.  You always bring me.  The Maze just holds the door.”

She leaned forward, voice dropping low.  “I remember what you said that night.”

  

Mitzy’s stomach flipped.  “No.”

  

“You told Mom it was my fault you lost the rabbit.  That you hated me.  That you wished I’d—”

  

“Stop!”

  

June’s body blurred, flickering between ages—the wide-eyed toddler, the tooth-gap child, the sullen shadow she’d grown into.  “Why?  You like stories.  This one’s yours.”

  

Mitzy lunged forward and grabbed her by the shoulders.  Her hands met something cold and slick.  The shape collapsed under her fingers like melting wax, leaving only the smell of earth and strawberry shampoo.

  

Larry darted close, pulling her back by the hem of her shirt.  “Lesson learned, Princess-Not?”

  

Mitzy stared at the empty bed.  The blanket was wet, dark with a stain that hadn’t been there a heartbeat ago.

Her voice came out thin.  “She’s gone again.”

  

Larry’s tone was almost gentle.  “For now.  But ghosts travel fast here.”

  

Mitzy turned to the window.  The hedge pressed closer against the glass, and in its surface, a single reflection watched her—June’s face, smiling from inside the leaves.
