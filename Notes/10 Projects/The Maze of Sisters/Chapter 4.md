# Act II — Mirrors and Memory

# Chapter 4 — The Garden of Mirrors
## Part 1 — The Clearing

“The next mistake,” Larry said.

  

The words followed them around the bend and into light. The corridor loosened, hedges sighing apart until the Maze opened its mouth wider than before. Mitzy stepped through first, spear balanced against her shoulder, and the air changed—cooler, rinsed clean, full of a brittle shine that made her eyes ache.

  

Leaves tiled the clearing like scales, thousands of them, each one slick and bright enough to catch a face. Sun broke through in narrow blades and scattered across the ivy, turning the whole place into a bowl of green glass. When she moved, a hundred Mitzys moved with her, small and uncertain and armed.

  

“Don’t touch,” Larry said, settling to hover at her cheek. “It’s hungry for fingerprints.”

  

Mitzy swallowed. “They’re just leaves.”

  

“Everything’s ‘just’ something,” he murmured. “Until it isn’t.”

  

She edged forward. The earth underfoot felt tight and springy, like a drumhead. Her reflections came closer—eyes too wide, mouth too thin, a smear of dirt at her jaw she could not wipe off because it lived in the leaf, not on her skin. She raised the spear a little and every Mitzy lifted hers, a forest of points aimed at a girl in the middle.

  

“Stop that,” she told herself, and the copies froze mid-breath, as if waiting to find out who got to be the real one.

  

Larry drifted higher, his shadow hopping from leaf to leaf. “This is where the Maze checks your homework.”

  

“I didn’t bring any,” she said, but softly, because the clearing felt like a church that had forgotten what it worshipped.

  

The nearest leaves shivered. Faces blurred, sharpened. One Mitzy looked older—chin up, eyes cold. Another smaller—baby fat in the cheeks, a milk tooth missing. A third turned her head in a way Mitzy hadn’t moved yet and smiled a mean little smile she didn’t recognize as hers.

  

Mitzy’s hands went damp on the shaft of the spear. “Make it stop.”

  

“You make it,” Larry said. “It only shows what you bring.”

  

She shifted her weight. The drumhead ground gave a mild complaint, a low creak like a door thinking about opening. She glanced down. Between the ivy’s glossy panes, the dark soil winked—then closed again as the leaves overlapped, careful and neat, hiding whatever looked back from underneath.

  

“June?” Mitzy tried, just to see. Her voice broke into the shine and scattered. A small face flickered on a dozen leaves at once—round, quick, gone.

  

She took a breath that felt too sharp for her lungs. “I saw her.”

  

“Did you?” Larry asked. “Or did she see you?”

  

Mitzy didn’t answer. She stepped into the center of the clearing where the light was brightest, turned slowly, and watched the crowded girl she was, had been, might be, gather itself around her like a ring of witnesses. The spear’s tip nudged a leaf; her reflection’s point met it from the other side with a tiny, perfect kiss. The sound it made was not metal on glass but something wetter, nearer to bone.

  

“Don’t,” Larry said again, but less sure this time.

  

Mitzy kept turning until the reflections doubled and the doubleness made her dizzy. Somewhere in that spinning, one of the Mitzys tilted her head like a question and lagged a heartbeat out of time.

  

Mitzy stopped. So did they. The late one didn’t. She kept smiling that not-quite-her smile and lifted her spear a fraction higher than all the rest.

## Part 2 — Reflections Speak

The smiling one stepped closer—or maybe the others shrank away—until Mitzy stood eye to eye with herself through a film of trembling leaf-light. She could see every detail: the dirt in her hairline, the tremor in her lip, the tiny scab on her knee from the day she’d tripped over June’s doll carriage and blamed the doll for existing.

“Don’t,” Mitzy whispered, though she didn’t know to which of them she was speaking.

The reflection tilted its head the wrong way and opened its mouth. When it spoke, the sound came from everywhere at once—like someone whispering through the bones of the Maze.

“She always took first.”

Mitzy flinched. “No.”

“The swing. The window seat. The last piece of cake.”

“She’s smaller!” Mitzy shouted. “She needed—”

“You needed,” said the voice. “But you gave it away.”

Mitzy stepped back. Her heel crushed a leaf and the reflection beneath her boot broke apart in liquid color, reforming at her shoulder. There was no end to her—Mitzys rippling in concentric circles, speaking over one another until the words braided into something like chanting.

“You needed. You gave. You needed. You gave.”

Larry circled above her, wings stirring light. “You’re making noise again, Princess. The Maze will think you’re trying to start a choir.”

“Make it stop!”

“Can’t. That’s your face talking.”

The reflections multiplied. Older, younger, meaner, softer—each with its own version of her frown. A child barely six crossed her arms and hissed, “She broke your crayons.” A teenager she hadn’t yet become sneered, “And you let her.”

Mitzy clutched the spear tight enough for her knuckles to go white. “Stop it! She’s just my sister!”

The mirrored Mitzys paused. Then one—an age she didn’t recognize at all—leaned forward, the eyes too dark, the voice too low.

“Then why did you dream she’d never been born?”

Mitzy’s throat went cold. “That’s not—”

“True?” the reflection asked, almost kindly. “We’re you, remember?”

The air in the clearing thickened. Leaves trembled on their stems. Somewhere under her feet the earth gave a long, slow sigh, as if the Maze had been waiting for that answer all along.

Larry’s voice came small and dry: “Careful, Princess-Not. The mirrors don’t lie. But they do enjoy exaggerating.”

Mitzy tried to swallow, but her mouth had gone dry. “What happens if I break them?”

Larry fluttered higher, wings a blur. “Depends whether you like the sound of yourself screaming.”

Mitzy looked down at her own doubled hands, every reflection holding the same weapon, every reflection trembling just slightly out of rhythm with her. The girl in the leaves smiled again.

“You’ll hit us,” she said. “And you’ll still be here.”

Mitzy raised the spear anyway.

## Part 3 — Shattering

Mitzy swung.

The spear cut a bright arc through the clearing, slicing light instead of air. For one clean heartbeat nothing happened—then every leaf screamed.

Not loud. Not noise. More like glass remembering it used to be sand.

The reflection nearest her burst first: colors folded inward, a mouth swallowing itself. The next followed, then another, until the whole glade shattered in ripples, each leaf turning from mirror to something wet and red-brown at the edges.

Mitzy stumbled back, the spear still humming. The smell hit next—green sap and iron, like the time she’d skinned her knee and cried because June hadn’t.

Larry hovered just beyond the wreckage, his wings slow and deliberate. “Feel better?” he asked.

“No.”

“Then why does the Maze?”

She looked around. The clearing had changed shape. The walls stood straighter now, breathing easier. The crushed leaves on the ground pulsed faintly, drinking up the light that leaked through the canopy.

“It wanted you to do that,” Larry said. “You fed it a memory. First taste is always the hardest.”

Mitzy wiped her mouth with the back of her hand. “They were me.”

“Bits of you. Echoes. Every Maze keeps souvenirs.”

“I heard them talk,” she said. “They knew things I never said.”

Larry gave a soft, humorless laugh. “Everybody’s thoughts are loud in here. You’re lucky it hasn’t started singing them back.”

She tightened her grip on the spear. “It’s not true. I never wanted her gone.”

The butterfly tilted in the air, half smile, half shadow. “Good. Keep saying it. The Maze loves a good denial—builds whole wings out of them.”

Mitzy’s knees gave a small, traitorous shake. She jabbed the spear butt into the dirt to steady herself. “What now?”

“Now?” Larry said. “You walk before the glass grows back. Or it’ll start making new faces to fill the cracks.”

She hesitated at the edge of the ruined clearing, eyes on the shards that used to be leaves. They reflected nothing anymore—just dark, wet soil below. Somewhere in that dark, a faint giggle rose and fell.

Mitzy didn’t wait to hear if it was hers.

She ran.

## Part 4 — Exit

The path ahead had no edges anymore—just a faint seam of trampled leaves guiding her out. Behind, the clearing stitched itself shut, vines twisting over the ruin with a slow, greedy sound. The mirrored leaves re-formed as she watched, already smoothing their surfaces, already learning a better way to reflect.

Larry glided beside her, quiet for once. His wings made small, exhausted sighs.

“Did I break it?” Mitzy asked.

“Nothing breaks here,” he said. “It only remembers what broke you.”

The spear felt heavier. Sap dried on the blade, leaving a dull, dark bloom. She wiped it on her skirt and the cloth came away streaked green and brown. Her stomach turned.

“I didn’t mean—”

“Sure you did.” Larry’s tone wasn’t cruel; it was simply matter-of-fact. “That’s what makes it work.”

They walked until the light changed from bright sick-green to dim gold. The air cooled. The hum in the walls faded to the slow heartbeat of something sated.

Mitzy stopped and looked back one last time. The clearing was gone—only a ripple of darker hedge where it had been. For a moment she thought she saw faces again, small and pale, pressed into the leaves like fossils. When she blinked, they were gone.

Larry brushed her ear with a wingtip. “Next time, Princess, maybe try talking to yourself before you start stabbing.”

“I didn’t stab me,” she said.

“Of course not,” he said softly. “You never do.”

She glared at him, but he had already risen toward the canopy, a black spark vanishing into gold light.

Mitzy turned forward. The corridor ahead bent in three directions at once. She chose the middle because it looked least certain and began to walk, the Maze whispering faintly after her, each syllable trying out her name in a different voice.

Mitzy. Mitzy. Mitzy.
