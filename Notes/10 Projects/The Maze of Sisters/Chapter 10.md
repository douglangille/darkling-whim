# Epilogue — White Magic (Reprise)
## Part 1 — The New Beginning

_Echo:_ The butterfly rose into the sky and vanished into the light.

  

Morning keeps the afterglow of that moment—thin gold on wet grass, a breeze that smells like the first peel of an orange. June stands at the edge of the field where the boxwoods used to wall off the world. There’s no hedge now, only a wide ring of ground that refuses to grow in straight lines. Dew beads along bent stems, gathering and letting go, gathering and letting go, the way a sleeping chest rises and settles.

  

She listens. Real wind moves here, loose and uneven, not the held breath the Maze used to keep. A dog barks twice far off; a truck backfires on the road. Ordinary sounds. But under them—quieter than a clock in another room—there’s a rhythm that doesn’t belong to traffic or dogs or June. It’s in the dirt. It’s in the weeds. It’s in the small hollow of her wrist when she presses two fingers there and counts, and feels the world counting back.

  

“Hey,” she says softly, testing the air. It isn’t a prayer and isn’t not one. “I came early.”

  

Nothing answers out loud. The field answers in movement. A patch of clover leans, then rights itself. A line of ants changes direction and then remembers its old path. June steps forward, slow, the way you step into a remembered room after a long time gone.

  

She walks the perimeter the way she always does now, a slow circle that steals the cold from her hands and puts it in the hem of her sleeves. At the northeast edge stands the new tree—the first that took root after the Maze unknotted itself. It’s taller than she is, taller than the fence behind it, not yet grown into anything a botanist could name. The bark looks ordinary until the light hits it slantwise. Then a faint green filigree climbs the trunk in threads, winks once, and hides.

  

June lays her palm there. The bark is cool at first, then warmer, then warmer still—like a hand meeting hers from the other side. “Still listening?” she whispers.

  

A leaf stirs with no help from wind. The warmth steadies against her skin.

  

“Good.” She lets herself lean her forehead to the trunk. A little of the night’s ache leaves her. “I brought that math test you would’ve made fun of,” she says, voice barely a breath. “You would’ve said the story problems were lies and the numbers were smug.”

  

The tree does not laugh. But the ground near the roots gives a small, contented sigh, the way a house settles when everyone has fallen asleep.

  

June takes the folded paper from her pocket and smooths it against the bark. Red pen circles flash, then dull under shadow. She holds it there until the page warms and the crease in the middle relaxes. When she pulls it back, a faint print of green dust clings to the corner where her name is written. A smudge, nothing more. She brushes it with her thumb and decides not to.

  

Beyond the tree, the field opens toward low sun. A pair of starlings lift, cross, and drop again. Somewhere a mower starts. The world remembers how to be itself.

  

June presses her palm to the trunk one last time. “I’ll come back after school,” she says. “Tell me if the ants get anywhere interesting.”

  

The bark cools, but it doesn’t let go. It holds the last of her warmth the way skin holds a touch after the hand is gone.

  

She steps back. The green filigree vanishes. The tree is only a tree again.

  

June turns for the path. Halfway across the field she stops and looks behind her, making sure the trunk still knows the shape of her hand. It does. The place where she stood is damp, darkening into a print the size of her foot. Dew gathers at its edges, then lets go.

## Part 2 — The Remembering Field

By afternoon the light has changed.

The wind that was gold in morning turns silver now, cooler, full of the smell of rain that never quite arrives.

June comes back the way she always does—alone, with her schoolbag bumping her hip and a sandwich she’s too restless to eat.

  

The field hums.

Not loud, not constant.  A note half a tone below silence, the kind that fades the instant you try to name it.

She walks through the grass, shoes dark with dew again, and the hum rises until it threads into the rhythm of her steps.

  

She says, “I know that trick.”

  

The field pretends not to hear her.

  

She drops her bag by the tree and lies on her back.  Above her, the clouds move the wrong direction—west to east.  They do that sometimes here.  The weather still remembers.

She closes her eyes and listens.

  

There it is again, that almost-voice, the same one she heard the night before a thunderstorm years ago when Mitzy told her ghost stories until they both laughed too hard to be afraid.

That laugh lives in the soil now.  It comes up through the roots and travels through her spine until she feels it shake loose in her throat.

  

“You’re still funny,” she says.

  

A handful of clover near her shoulder leans over, brushing her arm like someone’s hair.

“Okay,” she admits, smiling. “That was good.”

  

A bee wanders past, heavy with pollen.

She follows it with her eyes until it’s just a shadow on shadow.  Then she reaches into her bag and pulls out her notebook.

She writes without thinking, the way Mitzy used to when she needed to get something _out_.

The page fills with single sentences, each a seed she doesn’t expect to grow:

  

_The Maze was a wound that wanted to heal._

_Larry was real if you needed him to be._

_Sometimes staying is the same as saving._

  

When she looks up, the tree’s bark glows faintly again, reading over her shoulder.

“Don’t correct me,” she tells it. “It’s not homework.”

  

The light flickers once, like a wink.

  

She turns to a fresh page and writes one more line.

  

_White magic isn’t a spell. It’s the promise you keep after the story ends._

  

The hum in the soil settles.  The wind changes direction again, east to west this time.

The bee returns, lazy, looping, and disappears into the green filigree of the trunk.

  

June closes the notebook, tucks it under her arm, and looks toward the horizon.  A dark shape flickers there, small, drifting.  For a second she thinks it’s ash, then sees the wings.

  

A butterfly.

Black.

Silver edges.

Rising, turning once in a slow spiral, then vanishing into the sun.

## Part 3 - The Passing On

The light slips lower, amber deepening toward rose.

The mower has gone silent, the hum of it left hanging in her ears like a phantom limb.

June gathers her things, slinging her bag over one shoulder.  She takes the long way home, the path that skirts the field before cutting toward the village road.

  

Halfway along, she sees him: a boy, maybe five, crouched by the ditch.

He’s talking to the air.  Or so it looks until she notices the black flicker near his knee.

  

She slows.  “Hey,” she calls gently.  “You’ll scare it.”

  

The boy looks up, solemn.  “It’s not scared,” he says.  “It told me a joke.”

  

June kneels beside him.  The butterfly perches on his outstretched finger.

Same black wings, same faint silver edge, same impossible green glow in the middle.

Her throat tightens.

  

“What kind of joke?” she asks.

  

The boy grins, missing a front tooth.  “It said, ‘Don’t touch the walls.’ Then it laughed.”

  

June laughs too, though the sound catches in her chest.  “That’s a good one.”

  

The butterfly lifts off, circling both of them once, twice, then drifts toward the field.

The boy watches, eyes wide.  “It wants me to follow.”

  

“Maybe just to the edge,” June says.  “Butterflies don’t like being crowded.”

  

He nods and runs after it, his small shoes flashing in the fading light.

The butterfly leads him to the tree—_her_ tree—where it lands for a moment on the lowest branch before rising again, higher and higher, until it disappears against the sun.

  

The boy stares a long time, then waves.  “Bye-bye!” he shouts.

  

June stands behind him, quiet, her smile soft and tired and full.

“Yeah,” she says.  “Bye-bye.”

  

The boy turns.  “Do you think it’ll come back?”

  

June looks at the field—the grass, the tree, the earth breathing slow and steady under the dusk.

She nods.  “It always does.”

  

They walk toward the road together, shadows long and twin.

Behind them, the wind stirs the clover.

The field exhales once—an old, contented sigh—and the sound folds itself into evening.
