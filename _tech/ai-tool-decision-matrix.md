# AI Tool Decision Matrix
*Personal workflow for creative writing + GitHub repo management*

## When to Use What

### Copilot Chat (70% - Default)
**Trigger:** Working in VSCode, editing existing content
- Inline prose tweaks and expansions
- Quick scene refinements
- README updates
- Code/script generation
- File-level context queries
- Real-time completions
- **Models:** GPT, Claude, Gemini (toggle as needed)

### Perplexity Pro (20% - Discovery)
**Trigger:** New concepts, research, synthesis across repo
- Story universe ideation
- Quarterly planning dumps
- Cross-arc theme research
- Multi-folder synthesis
- "Show me all references to X across repo"
- Web research + repo context hybrid
- **Models:** All frontier (GPT-5, Claude Opus, Gemini 2.5+)

### Gemini CLI (8% - Heavy Lifting)
**Trigger:** Batch ops, MCP too slow, scripting needed
- Multi-scene consistency checks
- __inbox batch triage (50+ files)
- Large file diff operations
- Automated git workflows
- Search/replace across folders
- Generate reports from analysis
- Shell integration tasks

### Deprecated: Gemini Code Assist (0%)
**Reason:** Redundant - Copilot + CLI cover all use cases
