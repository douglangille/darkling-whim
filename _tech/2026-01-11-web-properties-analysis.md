# Web Properties Analysis
**Analysis Date:** January 11, 2026  
**Properties Reviewed:** Digital Doug (Substack) & On a Darkling Whim (Jekyll)

## Executive Summary

You maintain two distinct and complementary web presences that effectively separate professional and creative identities. Digital Doug (Substack) serves as a thought leadership platform for technology innovation and productivity in higher education, while On a Darkling Whim (douglangille.ca) functions as a creative portfolio for fiction and personal writing. Both properties demonstrate consistent voice, clear positioning, and deliberate content curation aligned with their respective purposes.

### Content Gaps & Opportunities

**Observed Gaps:**
1. **Publishing frequency** appears irregular (Sept/Nov 2025 visible, but gaps between)
2. **Community engagement signals** (comments, discussions) not visible in analysis
3. **Cross-linking** between Substack and Jekyll site could be stronger
4. **Email subscriber metrics** not visible (Substack growth indicators)

**Growth Opportunities:**
1. **Consistent cadence** - Establish predictable publishing rhythm (e.g., bi-weekly)
2. **Multimedia expansion** - Consider audio/video supplements (you mentioned podcast interest)
3. **Guest contributions** - Interview format with educators/innovators
4. **Tool reviews** - Systematic evaluation of productivity/AI tools
5. **Case studies** - Document specific NSCC innovation projects (where permissible)
6. **Synthesis posts** - Quarterly roundups connecting themes across posts

### Technical Implementation

**Platform Choice Assessment:**
- ✅ **Substack strengths:** Easy publishing, built-in newsletter, discoverability, minimal maintenance
- ⚠️ **Substack limitations:** Less control over design/branding, potential platform lock-in, limited analytics
- **Recommendation:** Continue with Substack for now; platform serves purpose well and aligns with "workbench not warehouse" philosophy

## On a Darkling Whim (douglangille.ca)

### Overview
- **Platform:** Jekyll (static site generator) hosted on Netlify
- **Tagline:** "On a Darkling Whim" (evocative, mysterious)
- **Domain:** douglangille.ca (canonical personal domain)
- **Primary Purpose:** Creative writing portfolio, fiction showcase, personal narrative

### Content Architecture

**Jekyll Structure Analysis:**
Your Workbench repository reveals sophisticated Jekyll implementation:
- Custom collections: `_writing`, `_posts`, `_drafts`, `_pages`
- Additional collections: `_farm`, `_life`, `_plan`, `_tech`, `_work` (personal knowledge management)
- Professional structure with includes, layouts, data files
- Netlify deployment with custom configuration

**Public Site Content (Sample):**
- **"A Couple LLM Prompt Tips"** (March 2024) - Practical AI guidance with anatomy of good prompts
- **"Digital Wellness: Working Smarter, Happier, and More Playfully"** (Feb 2024)
- **Creative fiction:** "Eddie's Decision" (2014), "Stormy Night" (2013) - Long-standing fiction presence

### Site Identity & Positioning

**Creative Focus:**
- Primary vehicle for fiction and narrative work
- Demonstrates long-term commitment (content dating back to 2013)
- Less frequent updates than Substack (intentional curation vs. regular publishing)
- Links to canonical domain establish authority and ownership

**Technical Sophistication:**
- Self-hosted with full control (Jekyll + Netlify)
- No platform dependencies or content lock-in
- Version-controlled via GitHub (content as code)
- Professional development workflow (Gemfile, config, custom themes)

### Content Gaps & Opportunities

**Observed Gaps:**
1. **Update frequency** - Appears less active than Substack
2. **Cross-pollination** - Limited visible connection between creative and professional content
3. **Story universe presentation** - If you're developing story universes (per your profile), unclear how they're showcased
4. **Navigation/discovery** - Without full site access, unclear how readers find older work

**Growth Opportunities:**
1. **Serial fiction** - Publish ongoing stories in installments
2. **Story universe hub** - Create dedicated sections for interconnected narratives
3. **Writing process posts** - Behind-the-scenes craft discussions
4. **Cross-linking** - Strategic bridges between Substack (craft) and Jekyll (creative work)
5. **RSS feeds** - Ensure discoverability for dedicated readers
6. **Portfolio curation** - Highlight best/representative work prominently

### Technical Implementation Assessment

**Jekyll Choice Evaluation:**
- ✅ **Strengths:** Full control, markdown-based, git workflow, no hosting costs (Netlify free tier), privacy-friendly
- ✅ **Alignment:** Matches your technical expertise and workflow preferences
- ✅ **Future-proof:** Content portable, no platform risk
- ⚠️ **Considerations:** Requires technical maintenance, slower to publish than Substack
- **Recommendation:** Maintain Jekyll for creative work; leverage technical control for unique presentation

   - Evaluate Substack paid subscriptions for premium content
   - Consider Patreon/Ko-fi for creative work supporters
   - Explore consulting/speaking opportunities stemming from Substack authority

3. **Technical Evolution**
   - Maintain Jekyll but explore modern static site generators (Eleventy, Astro) if needed
   - Investigate headless CMS options for easier Jekyll content management
   - Consider unified design system across both properties (subtle visual connections)

4. **Archive & Preservation**
   - Systematic backup of all Substack content to Workbench
   - Version control for Jekyll content evolution
   - Document content migration plans (maintain platform flexibility)

## Conclusion

Your dual web presence demonstrates intentional design and authentic voice. Digital Doug effectively positions you as a thought leader in educational technology and innovation, while On a Darkling Whim preserves space for creative expression and narrative work. The separation serves you well, but strategic cross-linking and content bridging could amplify both properties without compromising their distinct identities.

The technical implementation choices—Substack for ease of professional publishing, Jekyll for creative control—align with your stated "workbench not warehouse" philosophy. Both platforms serve their purposes effectively, though publishing cadence and audience engagement remain opportunities for growth.

**Primary Action:** Establish consistent publishing rhythm for both properties and create explicit bridges between professional craft discussions and creative output.
