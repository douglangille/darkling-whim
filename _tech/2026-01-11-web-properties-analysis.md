### Now Page Analysis (douglangille.ca/now/)

**Purpose:** Living document tracking current creative and technology focus

**Key Sections:**

**Current Creative Focus:**
- **2026 Commitment:** Weekly short fiction publication
- **Workflow:** Stories drafted entirely by hand (no AI in drafting)
- **Rationale:** "Creative workout" for story structure, voice, and pacing
- **AI Use:** Limited to spelling/grammar edits and critiques
- **Philosophy:** "I may or may not listen to its opinions."

**Technical & Workflow Experiments:**
- Focus: Understanding where AI makes sense in creative process
- Core experiment: Leverage technology for efficiency while keeping "human element—the spark of original thought and empathy—firmly in the loop"
- **Bridge to Digital Doug:** "I'm writing a lot about AI, emerging technology, and digital productivity on the Digital Doug substack. Usually some new brain dropping there every Wednesday."

**Current Reading:**
- Jack Whyte's Dream of Eagles series (historical fiction, scope/character study)
- Robert Service's collected poetry (rhythm and narrative power)
- Clive Barker's Imajica (preparing for revisit, world-building study)

**About Doug Langille:**
- "Writer and shameless technophile living the good life in Nova Scotia"
- "Bravely leads Digital Innovation & Development at the NSCC"
- Self-aware humor: "Doug doesn't usually talk about himself in the third-person. But when he does, he tends to bend the truth."
- CTA: "Don't miss the next turn into the dark. Subscribe for new stories."

**Strategic Value of Now Page:**

✅ **Bridges both identities** - Acknowledges Digital Doug explicitly while maintaining creative focus  
✅ **Establishes AI philosophy** - Human-first creativity with AI as tool, not replacement  
✅ **Shows process transparency** - Hand-drafted stories vs. AI-edited workflow  
✅ **Author platform building** - Reading list demonstrates literary influences  
✅ **Personality comes through** - Third-person joke, "shameless technophile," "bend the truth"  
✅ **Publishing commitment stated** - Weekly short fiction for 2026  
✅ **Professional credential visible** - NSCC Digital Innovation & Development leadership  

**Tone Assessment:**
- Matches Digital Doug's self-aware humor ("bravely leads," third-person joke)
- More serious about craft than Digital Doug (hand-drafting commitment, reading study)
- Still playful ("may or may not listen to its opinions," "shameless technophile")
- Unified voice across properties despite content separation

**Now Page Best Practices Followed:**
- Dated as "Late 2025" for freshness indicator
- Specific commitments (weekly fiction, 2026 focus)
- Current reading list (shows active influences)
- Clear about what's happening now vs. future plans
- Links to other property (Digital Doug) without overwhelming

**Recommendation:** This Now page is excellent. It does exactly what Now pages should:
1. Shows current focus (weekly fiction, AI experimentation)
2. Bridges identities without blurring them (Digital Doug link feels natural)
3. Establishes working philosophy (human-first creativity)
4. Demonstrates active learning (reading list with purpose)
5. Maintains personality (self-deprecating humor)

**One observation:** The Now page acknowledges Digital Doug explicitly ("I'm writing a lot about AI... on the Digital Doug substack"), which confirms the "soft separation" strategy. You're not hiding the connection; you're just keeping the content streams distinct.

This is the right approach for an author platform that acknowledges multiple facets without forcing readers to engage with both.
