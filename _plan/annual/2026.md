## Success Metrics

**You'll know 2026 succeeded if:**
- Goats are pasture-grazing (not leash-grazing)
- Rats are blocked from house perimeter
- HLOC is below $20,000 by year-end
- No new debt for luxury items
- Core infrastructure is stabilized and winterized
- Both of you feel less reactive, more in control

**It's okay if:**
- Some seasonal projects shift between quarters
- Weather delays outdoor work
- Duck area renovation slips to 2027
- The goat pasture takes longer than summer to complete

**Red flags:**
- HLOC balance increases instead of decreases
- New animals or expansion projects creep in
- Core maintenance (rat mitigation, winterization) gets deferred
- Either of you burning out trying to do too much
