# Annual Plans

This folder contains your annual planning documents.

## What Goes Here

One file per year: `YYYY.md`

**Format:** Narrative document with sections:
- Major projects by season
- Financial goals
- Family/household milestones  
- Maintenance rhythms
- Success metrics

**Planning Process:** Shared with Rhonda for personal/household. Individual for professional themes.

**When to Create:** Late December or early January during holiday downtime.

**When to Update:** Mid-year check (June/July) if major shifts occur. Otherwise leave as-is and just note deviations.

## Current Plans

- [2026.md](2026.md) - Current year (Theme: Stabilize & Secure)

## How to Use

**During Quarterly Planning:**
1. Open current year's file
2. Ask: "What fits this season/quarter?"
3. Pull relevant themes into quarterly plan
4. Don't copy verbatim - adapt to reality

**During Weekly Reviews:**
- Usually don't need to check annual
- Quarterly plan is sufficient for weekly planning
- Exception: If feeling lost, re-read annual to recalibrate

## Philosophy

**Annual plans are themes and direction, not task lists.**

They should:
- Fit on 2-4 pages
- Use outcome language ("X is secured", "Y is built")
- Recognize seasonal logic (weather, holidays, energy)
- Include "No" lists (what you're NOT doing)
- Have success metrics that feel achievable

**If your annual plan doesn't change at all during the year,** it's either too vague to be useful or you're not responding to reality.
