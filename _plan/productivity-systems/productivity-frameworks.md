# Productivity Frameworks

## Now–Next–Later (NNL)

### Source
ProdPad blog posts reviewed in August 2025.

### Core Concept

**Fix time, flex scope** — outcome-oriented structure.

### Characteristics

- Flexible
- Outcome-oriented
- Aligns with Agile Results
- Reduces cognitive load
- Supports clarity across contexts

### Application Contexts

#### 1. Work: Microsoft Planner (InnovDev Team)

**Implementation**:
- Buckets = Now / Next / Later
- Status field for progress tracking
- Priority-based (not process stages or domain buckets)

#### 2. Personal: Apple Reminders

**Implementation**:
- Lists for time horizon
- Lightweight adaptation
- Preserves clarity without overengineering categories
- Neurodivergent-friendly

#### 3. Creative: Novel Writing

**Implementation**:
- ChatGPT projects for Now work
- Notes/Reminders for Later
- Prevents distraction from premature worldbuilding
- Supports narrative progress

### Visual Template (Open Loop)

Cross-system integration across Apple tools and ChatGPT requested but not yet built.

## Agile Results

### Integration

- Tracked via RSS feed (no bookmark needed)
- NNL aligns naturally with Agile Results principles
- Outcome-oriented, not saga-based

### Application

- Scene-based productivity (not saga-based)
- Ambient pressure without overwhelming structure

## System Architecture

### Labs
- Domain-level ideation
- Persistent
- Reset with summaries

### Projects
- Focused deliverables
- Short-lived
- Archived once delivered

### ZORA (Obsidian Vault)
- Continuity historian
- Export destination for mature nuggets from Labs

### Memory
- Curated, recency-biased, editable
- Not a transcript dump
- Cross-chat context

### ChatMerge
- Append-only XML ledger
- Summarization framework
- Housekeeping chain: Chat → Summary → Lab → optional Project → ZORA

## Quarterly Resets

### Open Loop
- Establish cadence for periodic (e.g., quarterly) Memory review
- Align with productivity resets

### Naming Conventions (Open Loop)
- Finalize naming convention/versioning rules for Labs and Projects

## External Content (Open Loop)

- Systematize handling of external content (articles, notes) within Labs before ZORA promotion
