## The System in Five Seconds

**Mantra:** Note. Review. Act.

**Planning Horizons:**
- Annual = themes and big rocks
- Quarterly = outcomes and priorities
- Weekly = actual execution (in Apple Notes)

**Tool Split:**
- **Calendar** = time commitments
- **Reminders** = nudges + recurring habits
- **Notes** = scratchpad + weekly plans
- **Workbench** = frameworks + quarterly/annual planning

**Task Placement Litmus Test:**
1. Does it repeat? → Reminders
2. Has a specific "when"? → Calendar
3. Finite or ongoing? → Notes (finite) or Reminders (ongoing)

**"My weekly list is overwhelming"**  
→ Read [Common Pitfalls](weekly-planning-cadence.md#common-pitfalls)

**"Work priorities keep shifting"**  
→ Read [Common Scenarios](run-grow-transform.md#common-scenarios)

**"My quarterly plan feels stale"**  
→ Read [When Plans Break](annual-quarterly-planning.md#when-plans-break-and-they-will)

## Philosophy

**"It's supposed to be broken most of the time."**

This isn't defeatism - it's realism. Your planning system should:
- Help you make progress despite chaos
- Flex without breaking when life happens
- Take less time to maintain than to use
- Feel grounding, not guilt-inducing

**Workbench, not warehouse.**  
Keep it lean. Keep it actionable. Keep it real.

## Maintenance

**These framework docs are living documents.**

Update them when your thinking evolves, but resist the urge to constantly tinker. The system serves your work - not the other way around.
