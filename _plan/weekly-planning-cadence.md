# Weekly Planning Cadence

How to plan and review your week using Apple Notes.

## The Weekly Template

Your weekly list follows this format:

```
YYYY – Month D–D

Home
Task description (day cue)
Task description (day cue)

Work
Task description (day cue)
Task description (day cue)
```

### Format Notes

- **No pre-formatted bullets** - Add Apple Notes checkboxes manually
- **Day cues inline** - "Mon PM", "Wed–Fri", "before Sat"
- **Two sections** - Home and Work (four letters each for aesthetics)
- **Plain language** - Write tasks as mini-stories with context when helpful

### Example

```
2026 – January 5–11

Home
Call plumber about leaky tap (Mon)
Co-op run for chicken feed (Tue AM)
Fix basement vent with hardware cloth (Wed–Fri)
Garden boxes – make visible progress (any day)

Work
Team planning meeting – review Kanban board (Wed AM)
Write blog post (Thu)
Publish blog post (Fri)
Routine meetings as scheduled (ongoing)
```

## Task States During the Week

As you work through your week, tasks take on different states using Apple Notes' native formatting:

### Active
- Standard checkbox format
- Appears in your main list

### Completed
- Check the box
- Automatically collapses under "Completed" section
- Leave checked items in place

### Paused/Deferred (Mid-Week)
- Remove the checkbox entirely
- Becomes plain text in the list
- Signals "not happening this week, but haven't decided what to do yet"
- Handle during weekly review

### Migrated or Dropped (Weekly Review)
- Apply strikethrough formatting
- Indicates task was moved forward to next week or intentionally abandoned
- Provides visual record of what didn't happen

## The Weekly Review Ritual

**When:** Once per week (Sunday evening typical)  
**Duration:** 15-20 minutes maximum  
**Location:** Apple Notes on your device

### Step-by-Step Process

**1. Review Last Week (5 min)**
- Open last week's Note
- Observe what got checked off (completed)
- Look at unchecked items - what happened?
- Look at plain text items (deferred mid-week)
- Apply strikethrough to anything you're migrating or dropping

**2. Check Systems (3 min)**
- Quick scan of Apple Reminders - anything drift into guilt?
- Glance at Calendar - what's time-bound next week?
- Any recurring habits need adjustment?

**3. Consult Quarterly Plan (2 min)**
- Open current quarter's plan in Workbench
- Ask: "What needs visible progress this week?"
- Pull 1-2 items forward into weekly plan
- Don't over-commit

**4. Build Next Week (7 min)**
- Create new Note with date range header
- Add Home and Work sections
- List next week's tasks with day cues
- Include carry-forwards from last week (the ones you struck through)
- Add anything from quarterly that needs attention
- Add scheduled meetings/events from Calendar

**5. Sanity Check (2 min)**
- Read the full list
- Ask: "Can I actually do this?"
- If it feels like too much, trim 10-20%
- Better to under-commit and win than over-commit and guilt

### The Key Question

At the end of review ask: **"If I do nothing else this week, what three things would make this week successful?"**

Make sure those three are on your list and visible.

## Task Migration Rules

When deciding what to do with unfinished tasks:

### Migrate Forward If:
- Still relevant to current quarter
- You have capacity next week
- It's genuinely important (not just lingering guilt)

### Drop/Delete If:
- No longer relevant
- Someone else handled it
- Context changed and it doesn't matter anymore
- It's been on your list for 3+ weeks with no progress

### Move to Quarterly If:
- Important but not urgent
- Needs more time/resources than you have
- Better tackled later in the quarter

### The Guilt Test

If a task makes you feel guilty every time you see it but you never do it: **either commit to it next week with a specific plan, or delete it with permission.**

Guilt is not a productivity tool.

## Integration with Quarterly Planning

Your weekly plan serves your quarterly goals - not the other way around.

**Flow:**
1. Quarterly plan sets the direction ("what matters this season")
2. Weekly review pulls tasks from quarterly ("what moves the needle this week")
3. Daily work draws from weekly list ("what's next right now")

**Balance:**
- Not every weekly task comes from quarterly (life happens)
- Not every quarterly goal needs weekly attention (some simmer)
- Weekly planning keeps quarterly real and prevents drift

## Common Pitfalls

### Over-Planning
- **Problem:** List is too long, never complete it, feel guilty
- **Fix:** Trim by 20% during planning, not during the week

### Under-Planning  
- **Problem:** Vague tasks, don't know what to do, procrastinate
- **Fix:** Add context and day cues; make tasks concrete

### No Review Rhythm
- **Problem:** Lists accumulate, lose track, system falls apart
- **Fix:** Calendar block for Sunday review, non-negotiable

### Living in Notes All Week
- **Problem:** Constantly revising list, losing focus
- **Fix:** Review once weekly, execute rest of week

### Productivity Theatre
- **Problem:** Spending more time organizing than doing
- **Fix:** Remember the mantra - Note. Review. Act.

## Weekly Review as Leadership Practice

For work contexts, consider sharing a Monday morning brief with your team:
- What's clear this week
- What's uncertain/in flux  
- Where you need input
- How they can help

**Format:** Short narrative (3-4 sentences) + bullet list  
**Tone:** Candid and grounded, not performative  
**Purpose:** Transparency as clarity, not transparency as anxiety

This turns your personal weekly review into a team alignment tool.

## Maintenance Notes

**Weekly planning is for execution, not reflection.**  
- Reflection happens in ChatGPT (Zora)
- Knowledge capture happens in Obsidian (ZORA)  
- Strategic thinking happens in Workbench
- Weekly Notes = action only

**Keep the format flexible.**  
- Add sections if needed (Creative, Health, etc.)
- Adjust day cues as your week shifts
- The structure serves you, not the other way around

**When the system breaks:**  
- It will break - that's expected
- Miss a review? Start fresh next week
- List getting stale? Archive and restart
- Feeling overwhelmed? Cut the list in half

Remember: **It's supposed to be broken most of the time.**
