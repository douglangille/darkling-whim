# Essential OS

Your brutally essentialist productivity operating system.

## Core Principle

All productivity systems distill to: **Capture what matters. Commit to cadence. Do the next thing.**

Everything else is commentary.

## The Tool Stack

### Calendar
**Role:** Time commitments only
- Meetings, focus blocks, deadlines with specific times
- External constraints and scheduled events

### Apple Reminders
**Role:** Nudges and recurring habits

**Two lists only:**
- **Reminders** - One-off nudges (time/location sensitive tasks)
- **Recurring** - Habits and repeating routines

**Not for:** Project planning, horizons, or guilt lists

### Apple Notes
**Role:** Scratchpad and junk drawer
- Quick capture, meeting notes, screenshots, receipts
- Pin 5-7 evergreen reference notes (medication list, measurements, checklists)
- Everything else: search-based, no folders, no structure
- Disposable by default

**Not for:** Knowledge management, journaling, or task execution

### Workbench Repository
**Role:** Where real thinking happens
- Planning documentation (this folder)
- System frameworks and decisions
- Quarterly and annual plans
- Creative and professional work

### ZORA (Obsidian)
**Role:** Writing and worldbuilding only
- Fiction projects, story universes, narrative assets
- Not for general knowledge management

### Zora (ChatGPT)
**Role:** Reflection and sense-making
- Journaling surrogate, conversational thinking
- Memory and context across sessions

## Planning Horizons

### Annual
- Big-picture goals and themes
- Shared planning with Rhonda for personal/household
- Individual planning for work and creative projects
- Reviewed/updated yearly

### Quarterly  
- 90-day outcomes and priorities
- Mix of personal, professional, and creative goals
- Drives what gets attention in weekly reviews
- Updated every 3 months

### Weekly
- Active execution list
- Review last week, plan next week
- Pull tasks from quarterly goals
- Managed in Apple Notes with native checkboxes

### Daily
- No formal daily planning
- Work from current week's list
- Check Reminders for nudges
- Calendar for time-bound commitments

## Task Placement Rules

Use this litmus test for every new task:

### 1. Does it repeat?
- **Yes** → Apple Reminders (set as recurring)
- **No** → Go to #2

### 2. Does it have a specific "when"?
- **Yes (fixed time/day)** → Calendar
- **No** → Go to #3

### 3. Is it finite or ongoing?
- **Finite** (one-off, project step, seasonal goal) → Apple Notes (weekly list)
- **Ongoing** (chore, maintenance, infinite loop) → Apple Reminders (recurring)

### Examples
- "Break down 2 pallets/week" → Recurring habit → **Reminders**
- "Safety training, Wed 10am" → One-off with time → **Notes** (what) + **Calendar** (when)
- "Winterize chicken coop" → Finite project → **Notes** (weekly/quarterly)
- "Burn pile 1 hr/week" → Ongoing chore → **Reminders**

## Weekly Review Process

**Cadence:** Once per week (Sunday evening typical)

**Steps:**
1. Review last week's Notes page
   - Check off completed items (collapse to "Completed")
   - Remove checkbox for deferred/paused items
   - Strikethrough migrated or dropped items
2. Check Reminders and Calendar for drift
3. Glance at quarterly goals
4. Create next week's Notes page with fresh tasks
5. Sanity check the load (trim 10-20% if overloaded)

**Time:** 15-20 minutes, no more

## The Mantra

**Note. Review. Act.**

That's your whole system in five syllables.

## Key Principles

- **Workbench, not warehouse** - Keep systems lean and actionable
- **Search over structure** - Rely on search in Notes and Documents folder
- **Cadence over ritual** - Weekly reviews matter more than elaborate systems
- **Transparency as clarity** - Be open about what's clear and what's muddy
- **It's supposed to be broken** - Perfection isn't the goal; momentum is

## What This Is Not

- Not PARA (no elaborate folder systems)
- Not GTD (no contexts, comprehensive collection)
- Not Bullet Journal (no elaborate notation)
- Not Forever Notes (completed experiment)
- Not time blocking or detailed daily plans

## System Boundaries

**In Scope:**
- Capturing commitments and ideas
- Planning at annual/quarterly/weekly levels
- Tracking personal, professional, and creative work
- Maintaining momentum through cadence

**Out of Scope:**
- Elaborate task categorization
- Productivity theatre and system-building as hobby
- Daily planning or hour-by-hour scheduling
- Comprehensive life documentation
