# Quarterly Plans

This folder contains your quarterly planning documents.

## What Goes Here

**Personal/Household:** `YYYY-Q#.md` (optional - simple list format)  
**Professional:** `YYYY-FQ#.md` (using RUN/GROW/TRANSFORM framework)

**When to Create:** Every 13 weeks - last week of previous quarter or first week of new quarter.

**When to Update:** Mid-quarter check (week 6-7) if major shifts. Otherwise update at next quarter.

## How to Use

**During Weekly Reviews:**
1. Open current quarter's plan
2. Ask: "Does anything here need visible progress this week?"
3. Pull 1-2 items into weekly Apple Notes list
4. Don't force it - some weeks don't touch quarterly

**Mid-Quarter Check (Optional):**
- Week 6-7: Quick 15-minute review
- What's on track? What's not happening?
- Adjust if needed, but don't rebuild

## Quarter Alignment

**You have two quarter systems:**

**Fiscal Quarters (Work):**
- FQ1: Oct–Dec
- FQ2: Jan–Mar
- FQ3: Apr–Jun
- FQ4: Jul–Sep

**Calendar Quarters (Personal):**
- Q1: Jan–Mar
- Q2: Apr–Jun
- Q3: Jul–Sep
- Q4: Oct–Dec

**Don't try to force alignment.** Professional uses fiscal, personal uses calendar (or seasonal). Weekly planning integrates both.

## Philosophy

**Quarterly plans are outcomes and priorities, not task lists.**

They should:
- Fit on one screen (work) or simple list (personal)
- Pull from annual themes
- Adjust for reality
- Feel achievable in 90 days
- Flex when life happens

**Your quarterly plan is NOT your todo list.** It's your north star for weekly reviews.
