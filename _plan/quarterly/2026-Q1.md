## Success Metrics

**You'll know Q1 succeeded if:**
- March financial gate conditions are met (all four cleared)
- Vapor barrier is installed
- Workshop is functional and organized
- Rat entry points are patched (Phase 1 complete)
- 2025 farm books are done
- 2026 garden plan is drafted
- Both of you feel ready for summer builds

**It's okay if:**
- Some organization projects take longer than planned
- Weather delays pallet pile work
- Garden plan evolves through the quarter
- Not every room gets spring cleaned

**Red flags:**
- March gate conditions aren't met (delays all Q2 major spending)
- HLOC balance increases
- New luxury spending creeps in
- Core prep work (vapor barrier, rat patching) gets deferred
- Burning out trying to do too much indoors

---

## Q2 Handoff

**If March Gate Cleared:**
- Proceed with goat pasture construction
- Execute hardware cloth foundation perimeter install
- Begin poultry area improvements

**If March Gate Not Cleared:**
- Defer major spending projects
- Continue zero-spend work
- Reassess financial timeline
- Focus on maintenance and small wins
