# Personal Management System

## Three-Tier Capture System

### 1. Apple Notes (Transient Junk Drawer)
- **Purpose**: Sticky notes and ephemeral captures
- **Philosophy**: No pressure for organization
- **Content**: Quick thoughts, random ideas, transient information
- **Lifecycle**: Information gets promoted to Workbench if it proves valuable

### 2. Apple Reminders (Pure Execution)
- **Purpose**: Individual tasks and time-based triggers
- **Philosophy**: Execution only, no elaborate structures

#### Structure (4 Components)
1. **Default list**: All ad-hoc tasks and execution items
2. **Recurring**: Repeating tasks (farm chores, weekly reviews, etc.)
3. **Shopping**: Shared collaborative list for supplies/groceries
4. **"Now" smart list**: Aggregates default list items + recurring items due within 1-2 days
   - Single execution view for daily focus

### 3. GitHub Workbench Repo (Structured Planning)
- **Purpose**: All real notes and permanent planning
- **Content**:
  - Yearly and quarterly planning frameworks
  - All permanent documentation
  - Fiction project outlines and story universe development
  - README-based folder organization
  - Progress tracking and accountability
- **Benefits**:
  - Version-controlled knowledge base
  - Integrated with AI tooling via MCP
  - Code-adjacent planning in VS Code environment

## Planning Horizons

### Daily Execution
- Work from **"Now" smart list** in Apple Reminders
- Single view of everything requiring immediate attention

### Weekly Planning (Flexible)
- **Ritual**: Monday morning planning
- **Format varies by week**:
  - Some weeks: Paper-based
  - Some weeks: Digital calendar entries
  - Some weeks: Task-driven in Reminders
- **Goal**: "Plan somewhere on Monday morning"
- **Philosophy**: No fixed structure; adaptable to weekly context and energy

### Quarterly Progress Tracking (Structured)
- **Location**: GitHub Workbench repo
- **Purpose**: Primary accountability layer
- **Philosophy**: Weekly variations don't matter; quarterly outcomes do
- Actual progress measurement against goals

## Workbench Philosophy
"Workbench, not warehouse"
- Minimal tools with maximum control
- Structured where it matters (quarterly)
- Flexible where it helps (weekly)
- Zero guilt capture for transient thoughts
- Promotion-based permanence (Notes → Workbench when proven valuable)
