# RUN / GROW / TRANSFORM

Strategic framework for work planning and prioritization.

## Overview

This three-tier model organizes work by altitude and impact, helping you balance operational stability with strategic advancement.

## The Three Tiers

### RUN
**What it is:** Keep the lights on  
**Time horizon:** Continuous  
**Success metric:** Stability and responsiveness

**Characteristics:**
- Core operations that must never fail
- Non-negotiable table stakes
- Maintenance and support work
- Immediate response to urgent needs

**Your role:** Stabilizer + Connector
- Ensure systems stay reliable
- Bridge between teams
- Maintain smooth relationships
- Handle day-to-day coordination

### GROW
**What it is:** Build traction and capability  
**Time horizon:** Quarterly to annual  
**Success metric:** Visible progress and new partnerships

**Characteristics:**
- Expansion of existing capabilities
- Pilot programs and experiments
- Building credibility with stakeholders
- Creating options for future moves

**Your role:** Storyteller + Connector
- Narrate progress to leadership
- Bridge silos and teams
- Make pilots legible and credible
- Build momentum through visibility

### TRANSFORM
**What it is:** Shape institutional direction  
**Time horizon:** Annual to multi-year  
**Success metric:** Mindset shifts and new frameworks

**Characteristics:**
- Policy development
- Governance models
- Strategic positioning
- Cross-institutional collaboration

**Your role:** Storyteller + Strategist + Connector
- Craft institutional narrative
- Design roadmaps and frameworks
- Influence executive thinking
- Build external coalitions

## Work Planning with RUN/GROW/TRANSFORM

### Quarterly Planning

Break your quarterly goals into these three tiers:

```
FQ# (Calendar Quarter) – [Start Month]–[End Month]

RUN
- Operational outcome 1
- Operational outcome 2
- Key stability metric

GROW
- Expansion initiative 1
- Partnership goal 1
- Pilot or experiment

TRANSFORM
- Policy/governance milestone
- Strategic framework deliverable
- Cross-institutional outcome
```

### Balance Guidelines

**Attention Split (Approximate):**
- RUN: 50% of actual work time
- GROW: 30% of work time
- TRANSFORM: 20% of work time

**But leadership visibility should invert:**
- RUN gets acknowledged but not celebrated
- GROW gets storytelling and credit
- TRANSFORM gets strategic airtime

**Why:** You're measured on innovation and advancement, but judged on reliability.

### The Grounding Principle

When chaos hits (budget cuts, mandate shifts, leadership churn), return to this:

**"We support teaching and learning first. We push the envelope second."**

Core business (RUN) always trumps innovation theater.

## The One-Screen Strategic Brief

Use this format for quarterly communication with your team and leadership.

### Template

```
**[Team Name] FQ# Brief – [Month]–[Month] [Year]**

[2-3 sentence context paragraph - candid tone, set expectations]

**RUN**
[What you're maintaining/operating]  
Levers & People: [Key collaborators]  
Forward Path: [How you'll know it's working]

**GROW**
[What you're expanding/building]  
Levers & People: [Key partners]  
Forward Path: [Milestones and handoffs]

**TRANSFORM**
[What you're shaping/influencing]  
Levers & People: [Strategic relationships]  
Forward Path: [Deliverables and evolution]

[1-sentence closing - your throughline message]
```

### Tone Guidelines

**Blunt, not polished:**
- "Things are messy, and they'll stay messy."
- "It's supposed to be broken most of the time."
- "We're explorers who keep momentum."

**Strategic, not aspirational:**
- State what you're actually doing
- Name dependencies and blockers
- Be honest about capacity

**Brief, not comprehensive:**
- One screen maximum
- Teams post or short email
- Can be shared upward without editing

## Integration with Personal Planning

### Separation of Concerns

**Work planning (this framework):**
- Goes in Workbench under `_plan/quarterly/`
- Uses RUN/GROW/TRANSFORM structure
- Shared with team and leadership

**Personal planning (Essential OS):**
- Lives in Apple Notes
- Uses Home/Work weekly lists
- Private execution space

**Bridge:**
- Quarterly work goals feed into weekly Work section
- Weekly review checks against quarterly brief
- But don't duplicate - reference, don't replicate

### When Work Spills Over

Some GROW initiatives (esports, makerspaces) blur personal interest and professional responsibility.

**Guidelines:**
- If it's your job to move it forward → Work
- If it's passion project adjacent to job → Creative (separate planning)
- If institution depends on it → RUN (regardless of personal interest)

## Common Scenarios

### "Everything Feels Like RUN"

**Problem:** Firefighting dominates, no time for growth  
**Response:** 
- Stabilize one system fully before adding GROW work
- Delegate or automate recurring RUN tasks
- Block time for GROW work like you block meetings

### "TRANSFORM Feels Impossible"

**Problem:** Strategic work keeps getting deferred  
**Response:**
- TRANSFORM often happens through conversations, not deliverables
- One coffee meeting with a peer institution = progress
- Draft frameworks in 30-minute chunks, not marathon sessions

### "Nobody Notices RUN Until It Breaks"

**Problem:** Operational work feels thankless  
**Response:**
- RUN is your credibility foundation
- Don't seek applause for RUN - but don't let it break
- GROW and TRANSFORM only work if RUN is solid

### "Leadership Keeps Changing Priorities"

**Problem:** Your GROW/TRANSFORM plans keep getting disrupted  
**Response:**
- This is normal, not failure
- Keep your one-screen brief updated
- Show momentum despite pivots
- "It's supposed to be broken most of the time"

## Stakeholder Management

### Key Relationship Types

**Operators (RUN focus):**
- Need: reliability, quick response, clear communication
- Your mode: responsive, detail-oriented, problem-solver

**Partners (GROW focus):**
- Need: momentum, visibility, shared wins
- Your mode: collaborative, storyteller, bridge-builder

**Strategists (TRANSFORM focus):**
- Need: vision, frameworks, institutional thinking
- Your mode: thought partner, provocateur, synthesizer

### The Connector Role

Across all three tiers, you're primarily a **connector**:
- Between technical and academic
- Between current state and future vision
- Between siloed teams
- Between institutional priorities and ground reality

This is your superpower - don't undervalue it.

## Quarterly Rhythm

**Month 1:** Execute with high energy, full capacity  
**Month 2:** Mid-quarter check - adjust, reprioritize if needed  
**Month 3:** Close out commitments, draft next quarter brief

**Don't over-formalize:** The brief is a snapshot, not a contract.

## Team Communication

### Monday Brief (Optional)

Short "state of mind" update:
- What's clear this week
- What's in flux
- Where you need help

**Purpose:** Turn transparency into clarity  
**Tone:** Same as strategic brief - candid, grounded  
**Length:** 3-5 sentences + optional bullets

### When to Update the Brief

- Quarterly (always)
- When major priorities shift
- When new people join your team or leadership
- Never more than once per month

## The Philosophy

**"It's fine. It's supposed to be broken most of the time."**

This isn't defeatism - it's realism in complex systems:
- RUN work will always have fires
- GROW work will always have uncertainty
- TRANSFORM work will always face resistance

Your job isn't perfection. It's **keeping momentum despite the mess.**
