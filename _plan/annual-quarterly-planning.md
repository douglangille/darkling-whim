# Annual & Quarterly Planning

How to plan at the horizon level - setting direction without over-engineering.

## Philosophy

Planning at annual and quarterly levels is about **setting direction, not locking in tasks.**

- Annual = themes and big rocks
- Quarterly = outcomes and priorities  
- Weekly = actual execution

The higher the horizon, the looser the plan.

## Annual Planning

### When
**Late December or early January**  
Ideally during holiday downtime when you have mental space.

### Who
**Shared process with Rhonda for personal/household**  
Individual process for professional and creative work.

### What You're Deciding

Not a comprehensive life plan - just answers to these questions:

**Personal/Household:**
- What are the big seasonal projects? (home, yard, farm)
- What are the financial priorities? (major purchases, savings goals)
- What are the family/relationship milestones? (trips, visits, celebrations)

**Professional:**
- What capabilities need to mature this year?
- What relationships need cultivation?
- What strategic positioning matters?

**Creative:**
- What projects get active attention?
- What's simmering vs what's shipping?
- What experiments are you running?

### Format

**For Personal/Household:**  
Narrative document with sections (see 2026 Roadmap as example):
- Major projects by season
- Financial goals
- Family milestones
- Maintenance rhythms

Store in `_plan/annual/YYYY.md`

**For Professional:**  
Four quarterly briefs (rough drafts):
- FQ1, FQ2, FQ3, FQ4
- Use RUN/GROW/TRANSFORM framework
- Light detail, expect heavy revision

Store in `_plan/quarterly/YYYY-Q#.md`

**For Creative:**
- Active projects list
- Experiments/pilots
- Publishing/shipping goals

Store wherever your creative work lives (ZORA, separate repo, etc.)

### Integration Point

**The goal is NOT to create one unified master plan.**

Life is messy. Work, home, and creative don't align neatly.

Instead: recognize where they overlap or conflict, and make conscious trade-offs.

Example conflict: "Q2 has major home renovation + work LMS RFP + creative book deadline"  
→ Make explicit choice: which one gets degraded or deferred?

## Quarterly Planning

### When
**Every 13 weeks** (approximately)  
Last week of the previous quarter or first week of new quarter.

### Process

#### 1. Review Last Quarter (15 min)
- What actually happened vs what you planned?
- What got dropped and why?
- What surprised you?
- What patterns emerged?

**Don't beat yourself up.** Just observe.

#### 2. Environmental Scan (10 min)
**Personal:**
- What season is it? (affects home/yard priorities)
- Any major life events coming?
- Health/energy levels - realistic capacity?

**Professional:**
- What's leadership focused on?
- Budget situation?
- Team stability?
- External pressures (policy, mandates, etc.)?

**Creative:**
- What projects have momentum?
- What's stalled and why?
- Any deadlines or commitments?

#### 3. Set Quarterly Outcomes (20 min)

**For Personal/Household:**  
Pull from annual plan, adjust for reality:
- What home/yard projects MUST happen this season?
- What habits need establishing or maintaining?
- What family/relationship goals fit this quarter?

Format: Outcome-style statements  
Example: "Chicken coop winterized and secure"

**For Professional:**  
Use RUN/GROW/TRANSFORM brief:
- RUN: What stability work can't slip?
- GROW: What initiatives can advance?
- TRANSFORM: What strategic work fits?

One-screen maximum, shareable with team.

**For Creative:**
- What's the one primary project?
- What's the maintenance work (newsletters, etc.)?
- What experiments can you run?

#### 4. Sanity Check (5 min)
Read the full quarterly plan out loud.

Ask:
- "Can I actually do this?"
- "What will I regret NOT doing?"
- "What's the worst that happens if something slips?"

Trim by 20% if it feels heavy.

### Format Examples

#### Personal/Household Quarterly

```
Q# Goals (Month–Month)

## Quarterly → Weekly Bridge

**Your quarterly plan is NOT your todo list.**

It's your north star for weekly reviews.

### During Weekly Reviews

1. Open current quarter's plan
2. Ask: "Does anything here need visible progress this week?"
3. Pull 1-2 items into weekly list
4. Don't force it - some weeks don't touch quarterly at all

### Mid-Quarter Check (Optional)

**Week 6-7 of the quarter:**  
Quick 15-minute review:
- What's on track?
- What's clearly not happening?
- Should anything be deferred to next quarter?
- Any new priorities emerged?

Update quarterly doc if needed, but don't rebuild from scratch.

## Annual → Quarterly Bridge

**Your annual plan informs quarterly, but doesn't dictate it.**

### At Each Quarterly Planning Session

1. Glance at annual plan
2. Ask: "What fits this season/quarter?"
3. Pull relevant themes into quarterly plan
4. Adjust for reality (things change)

### Mid-Year Check (Optional)

**June/July:**  
30-minute reflection:
- Is the annual plan still relevant?
- What's changed?
- What needs abandoning vs doubling down?

Update annual doc if major shifts, otherwise just note deviations.

## Common Mistakes

### Over-Planning
**Problem:** Quarterly plan is 5 pages, totally overwhelming  
**Fix:** One screen max for work, simple list for personal

### Under-Planning
**Problem:** No real direction, constantly reactive  
**Fix:** Even 3-5 clear outcomes beats no plan

### Treating Plans as Contracts
**Problem:** Guilt when things slip or change  
**Fix:** Plans are hypotheses, not commitments

### Planning in Isolation
**Problem:** Personal and work plans conflict, cause stress  
**Fix:** Do them near same time, note conflicts explicitly

### No Review Rhythm
**Problem:** Quarterly plans gather dust, never consulted  
**Fix:** Weekly reviews must reference quarterly (even briefly)

## The Integration Challenge

You have three planning streams that don't align:

**Fiscal quarters (work):** Oct-Dec, Jan-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sep  
**Calendar quarters (personal):** Jan-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sep, Oct-Dec  
**Seasons (home/yard):** Based on weather and daylight

**Don't try to force alignment.** Just be aware of the mismatch.

### Practical Approach

- **Professional planning:** Use fiscal quarters (matches your institution)
- **Personal planning:** Use calendar quarters or seasonal (your choice)
- **Weekly planning:** Integrates both, regardless of quarter boundaries

## Shared Planning with Rhonda

### Annual Planning Session

**Setup:**
- Schedule 2-3 hours when you're both fresh
- Have last year's plan (if it exists) available
- Paper or digital - whatever works for both

**Process:**
1. **Reflect** (20 min) - What happened last year?
2. **Braindump** (30 min) - What wants attention this year?
3. **Prioritize** (30 min) - What actually matters?
4. **Sequence** (30 min) - What happens when (seasonal logic)?
5. **Document** (30 min) - Write it down in shared format

**Output:** One document you both reference  
**Storage:** Your Workbench + Rhonda's paper system (her choice)

### Quarterly Check-ins

**Less formal than annual.**  
30-minute conversation:
- What's coming up this quarter?
- Any conflicts in our plans?
- What needs coordinating?

Don't need to create shared quarterly docs - just align on big stuff.

## Creative Planning Integration

Creative work often doesn't fit neat quarters.

**Instead of forcing it:**
- Note which creative projects are "active" each quarter
- Set minimal viable goals (e.g., "ship 4 flash fiction pieces")
- Accept that creative work ebbs and flows with work/life demands

**The key question:** "What's my primary creative focus this quarter?"  
Everything else is maintenance or opportunistic.

## When Plans Break (And They Will)

### Common Disruptions

**Personal:**
- Family emergency
- Health issue
- Unexpected home crisis
- Weather derails seasonal work

**Professional:**
- Leadership churn
- Budget cuts
- Mandate letter from province
- Crisis response (pandemic, strike, etc.)

**Creative:**
- Loss of momentum
- Better idea emerges
- Deadline shifts

### Response Pattern

1. **Acknowledge the break** (don't pretend it didn't happen)
2. **Triage** (what absolutely can't slip?)
3. **Defer or delete** (what can wait or die?)
4. **Update the plan** (revise doc, don't start over)
5. **Reset rhythm** (next weekly review, get back on cadence)

### The Reminder

**"It's supposed to be broken most of the time."**

A plan that survives unchanged for 13 weeks is either:
- Too vague to be useful, or
- You're not responding to reality

## Tools & Storage

**Annual Plans:** `_plan/annual/YYYY.md` in Workbench  
**Quarterly Plans (Work):** `_plan/quarterly/YYYY-FQ#.md` in Workbench  
**Quarterly Plans (Personal):** Simple list doc in `_plan/quarterly/` or Apple Notes  
**Weekly Plans:** Apple Notes (disposable, execution-focused)  

**Do not over-organize.** A few markdown files in a flat structure is plenty.

## Success Metrics

You're doing this right if:

- You can answer "What matters this quarter?" in 30 seconds
- Weekly reviews feel grounded, not random
- You're making visible progress on 2-3 big things per quarter
- Plans flex without breaking when life happens
- You don't feel guilty about what's not happening

You're doing it wrong if:

- Quarterly docs are dusty and never opened
- Weekly planning feels disconnected from bigger goals
- You're constantly surprised by deadlines or seasons
- Plans are too detailed to update
- Planning takes more time than doing
