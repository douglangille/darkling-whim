FICTION GENRE TAGGING BEST PRACTICES
=====================================

Standard Publishing Industry Framework (15-18 genres covers ~95% of fiction):

CORE GENRES (pick 1 primary):
- Literary Fiction (character-driven, introspective, literary merit focus)
- Science Fiction (speculative, technology, future/alternate worlds)
- Fantasy (magic, mythical, otherworldly)
- Mystery/Crime (detective, investigation, crime)
- Thriller/Suspense (plot-driven tension, fast-paced)
- Horror (fear, dark, grotesque)
- Romance (primary plot is relationship/love)
- Comedy (humor, absurdist, satire)

MODIFIERS/SUBGENRES (add 0-3):
- Paranormal (ghosts, supernatural, vampires, witches)
- Noir (dark detective, gritty, cynical tone)
- Psychological (mental states, unreliable narrator, mind-bending)
- Character-Driven (internal focus, coming-of-age, identity)
- Experimental (non-traditional form or structure)
- Dark [Genre] (adds gothic/sinister tone to any genre)
- Romantic [Genre] (adds romantic subplot)

SEPARATE CATEGORIES (always tag):
- Format: flash-fiction, vignette, short-story, poem
- Universe/World: haley, [other worlds as you create them]

TOTAL RECOMMENDATION:
- 1 format tag (required)
- 0-2 universe tags (as applicable)
- 1 primary genre + 1-3 modifiers = 2-4 genre tags
= 3-7 tags total per story

EXAMPLE TAGGING:
"Stormy Night" → vignette, psychological-thriller, paranormal
"Free-Fall" → flash-fiction, sci-fi, psychological-thriller
"Herb's Bad Week" → short-story, comedy, dark-comedy
"Red Dot" → flash-fiction, psychological-thriller, experimental

This framework means you'd have ~20 total unique tags max, but they're:
✓ Discoverable (readers know what they're getting)
✓ Not redundant (no "literary" catchall)
✓ Balanced (no 92-tag sprawl)
✓ Professional standard
