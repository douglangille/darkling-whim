## Critical Context: Metabolic Deterioration & Intervention

**September → December 2025 (3.5 months):**
- HbA1c: 6.5% → 6.9% (+0.4%) - Approaching diabetic threshold
- Urine Albumin: 7.5 → 22.7 mg/L (+203%) - Microalbuminuria appearing
- Fasting Glucose: 8.9 mmol/L - Significantly elevated

**Response:** Comprehensive 5-drug regimen initiated January 9, 2026  
**Key Intervention:** Ozempic therapy started January 13, 2026

**Goals:**
1. Reduce HbA1c from 6.9% to <6.0%
2. Weight loss to trigger metabolic cascade improvements
3. Address chronic fatigue and improve healthspan

## Usage Guidelines

### For AI Assistants in Clean Chats

When starting fresh conversations about health:

1. **Load Context First**
   ```
   Read: _life/health/patient_summary_jan2026.md
   ```
   This single file contains:
   - All diagnosed conditions and medications
   - Recent bloodwork trends and clinical priorities
   - Ozempic therapy protocol and monitoring plan
   - Lifestyle baseline and tracking strategy
   - Neurodivergent considerations for sustainability

2. **Check Data Files for Details**
   - `medications_jan2026.json` - Full medication specs with DINs
   - `bloodwork_comprehensive_jan2026.json` - Detailed lab results
   - `health_timeline_jan2026.json` - Chronological event tracking

3. **Understand Key Priorities**
   - **Priority 1:** Ozempic therapy (started Jan 13) - monitor side effects, hydration, protein
   - **Priority 2:** Kidney function - early microalbuminuria detected
   - **Priority 3:** HbA1c reduction - goal from 6.9% to <6.0%
   - **Priority 4:** Gout risk - weight loss can trigger flares
   - **Priority 5:** Muscle preservation - adequate protein essential

4. **Respect Neurodivergent Context**
   - Patient has autism/ADHD traits (Asperger's cluster)
   - Tracking strategy designed for sustainability (not perfection)
   - "Workbench, not warehouse" philosophy applies to health data
   - Weekly check-ins, not daily logging (reduces executive function burden)
   - System must survive inconsistency without collapsing

5. **Maintain Medical Authority**
   - Always defer to Dr. Sharma and Dr. Massaro's guidance
   - Provide evidence-based information for informed provider discussions
   - Flag concerns requiring medical attention
   - Never contradict explicit medical advice

6. **Track Interconnections**
   - Weight loss affects: BP, cholesterol, sleep apnea, testosterone, gout
   - Note cascade effects across multiple conditions
   - Monitor for medication dose adjustment needs
   - CPAP and TRT may need adjustment as weight decreases

### For Human User (Doug)

1. **Starting a Health Discussion**
   - Point AI to: `_life/health/patient_summary_jan2026.md`
   - This loads full context in one document
   - No need to explain conditions, meds, or history

2. **After Medical Appointments**
   - Update `patient_summary_jan2026.md` with new info
   - Add bloodwork results to JSON files
   - Update medication changes
   - Document provider feedback and next steps

3. **Weekly Ozempic Check-ins (Mondays)**
   - Note side effects, energy levels, GI status
   - Track weight trend (not daily fluctuations)
   - Monitor gout symptoms, bowel movements
   - Protein awareness check (not rigid counting)

4. **Quarterly Reviews**
   - Update after bloodwork (HbA1c is primary metric)
   - Assess medication effectiveness
   - Review tracking system sustainability
   - Adjust strategies as needed

---

## Next Medical Appointments

- **Late Feb/Early March 2026:** Phone check-in with Dr. Sharma (Ozempic tolerance)
- **April 2026:** In-person with Dr. Sharma + comprehensive bloodwork (3-month assessment)
- **Every 3 months:** Regular follow-up with bloodwork
- **Every 6 months:** Testosterone/PSA/prostate with Dr. Massaro

---

## Key Monitoring Metrics

### Weekly (Mondays before injection)
- Weight trend
- Side effects (GI, nausea, energy)
- Gout symptoms
- Bowel movement pattern
- Protein awareness

### Quarterly (Medical appointments)
- **HbA1c** (primary diabetes metric - goal: <6.0%)
- **Lipid panel** (LDL goal: <2.6 mmol/L)
- **Kidney function** (eGFR, creatinine, urine albumin)
- **Blood pressure**
- **Weight trend**
- **Liver function** (monitor medication effects)

### Biannually (Dr. Massaro)
- **Testosterone levels**
- **PSA**
- **Prostate exam**

## Important Notes

### Ozempic Therapy Critical Points
1. **Hydration:** 1.5-2L water daily (constipation risk)
2. **Protein:** 60-150g daily (muscle preservation)
3. **Never overeat:** Push plate away when full (severe reflux risk)
4. **Crackers on hand:** Combat nausea (appetite window short)
5. **Monday injection timing:** Worst side effects Tue-Wed, clears weekends
6. **Gout monitoring:** Weight loss can trigger flares

### Tracking Philosophy
**Sustainable > Perfect**
- Weekly check-ins, not daily logs
- Awareness, not rigid counting
- System must survive ADHD inconsistency
- HbA1c is the real measure (quarterly bloodwork)
- Trust the medication process, track enough to spot problems

### Cascade Hypothesis
Weight is primary driver of interconnected issues. Weight loss should improve:
- Blood sugar control
- Blood pressure
- Cholesterol
- Sleep apnea severity
- Gout risk (long-term)
- Libido
- Natural testosterone production
