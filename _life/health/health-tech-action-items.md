# Health Tech Stack - Action Items

## Immediate Actions

### 1. Delete Apple Health App
- Long-press Apple Health icon on home screen
- Select "Remove App" → "Delete App"
- Confirm deletion
- **Note**: Your health data remains safely stored in HealthKit system partition

### 2. Set Up Testosterone Injection Reminder
**In Apple Reminders**:
- Open Reminders app
- Create new reminder: "Testosterone injection"
- Set to repeat: Every 2 weeks
- Choose your preferred day/time
- Enable notification alert
- Save

### 3. Bookmark myAir Web App
**In Safari**:
- Navigate to https://myair.resmed.com
- Tap Share icon → "Add to Home Screen"
- This creates a web app icon that launches directly to myAir
- **Benefit**: No mobile app install needed, no App Store management

### 4. Review Fitbit App Settings
- Open Fitbit app
- Disable any unnecessary notifications (reduce cognitive load)
- Ensure step tracking is active
- Review sleep tracking settings (keep enabled for trend data)
- **Do NOT purchase any third-party sync apps**

### 5. Audit OneTouch Reveal
- Keep app installed (you already have it)
- Turn off notifications if enabled (you're not actively testing)
- If you begin regular glucose testing in future, re-enable notifications
- Otherwise leave passive

## Do NOT Do

### ❌ Don't Purchase Third-Party Sync Apps
- Sync Solver
- myFitnessSync
- Power Sync
- Health Sync
- FitToFit

**Reason**: Not worth the $10-60 cost + ongoing maintenance burden for data that doesn't improve outcomes

### ❌ Don't Try to Wire Fitbit → Apple Health → myAir
**Reason**: This is the "rickety setup" you identified. It's a product architecture gap on iOS, not worth working around.

### ❌ Don't Reinstall Apple Health Unless...
You have a specific clinical need requiring consolidated data view for a healthcare provider. This is unlikely given your current care model.

### ❌ Don't Buy an Apple Watch (Yet)
**Unless**: You decide sleep stage data is personally valuable (curiosity/interest), not clinical necessity. If you do buy one later, Apple Watch integrates natively with myAir without third-party bridges.

## Ongoing Maintenance

### Weekly
- Review myAir web dashboard (5 min)
  - Check AHI trends
  - Review mask seal quality
  - Confirm usage hours >4h/night
  - Read any feedback/tips from myAir

### Biweekly
- Respond to testosterone injection reminder
- Complete injection
- Mark reminder as complete

### Monthly
- Review Fitbit activity trends (optional, 5 min)
  - Check step averages
  - Review sleep trend data (acknowledge CPAP mask affects accuracy)
  - Use for motivation, not clinical decisions

### Quarterly
- During doctor appointments:
  - Share myAir AHI trends (export from web if requested)
  - Discuss A1C blood work results
  - Review blood pressure readings
  - Confirm testosterone therapy effectiveness

## Expected Outcomes

### Cognitive Load Reduction
- **Before**: 5+ apps (Apple Health, third-party sync, Fitbit, myAir mobile, OneTouch, Reminders)
- **After**: 3 primary contexts (Safari/myAir web, Fitbit, Reminders)
- **Result**: Reduced task-switching, ADHD-friendly workflow

### Cost Savings
- **Avoided**: $10-60 third-party sync app purchase
- **Avoided**: Ongoing time cost of maintenance/troubleshooting
- **Total**: $10-60 + 2-4 hours/year saved

### Preserved Clinical Value
- **CPAP adherence**: Maintained via myAir's native feedback mechanism
- **Activity awareness**: Maintained via Fitbit's native interface
- **Medication adherence**: Maintained via Apple Reminders
- **Clinical outcomes**: No degradation from simplified stack

## Success Metrics

### How to Know This Is Working

**CPAP Adherence**:
- Target: >4 hours/night, >70% of nights
- Check: myAir daily score consistently in "Good" or better range
- Action: If adherence drops, troubleshoot mask fit/comfort (myAir provides tips)

**Activity Level**:
- Target: ~10,000 steps/day (your stated habit)
- Check: Fitbit weekly summary
- Action: Use data for motivation, not clinical intervention

**Medication Compliance**:
- Target: 100% adherence to biweekly testosterone injections
- Check: Respond to all Reminders notifications
- Action: If you miss a reminder, assess if timing/notification needs adjustment

**System Friction**:
- Target: Zero maintenance time on health tech integrations
- Check: No troubleshooting of sync issues, no app configuration drift
- Action: If you're spending time on integration problems, you've added complexity back in

## Review Schedule

### 3-Month Check-In (March 2026)
Ask yourself:
1. Am I consistently checking myAir? (If no, adjust routine)
2. Is Fitbit providing value, or just noise? (If noise, consider reducing engagement)
3. Have I missed any testosterone injections? (If yes, adjust reminder time/method)
4. Do I feel like I'm missing data by not having Apple Health? (If yes, reconsider; if no, confirm decision was correct)

### 6-Month Check-In (June 2026)
Ask yourself:
1. Has my CPAP adherence improved, maintained, or declined?
2. Has my activity level (steps) improved, maintained, or declined?
3. Have I needed to reinstall Apple Health for any reason?
4. Has this simplified stack reduced cognitive load as expected?

### Annual Check-In (December 2026)
Full reassessment:
1. Review A1C trends over the year
2. Review CPAP adherence patterns
3. Review activity/weight trends
4. Assess whether tech stack needs any adjustments based on changing health needs
