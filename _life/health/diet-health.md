# Diet & Health: Doug's Default Day

## Health Context

### Current Status
- Weight: 320 lbs
- Pre-diabetes
- High cholesterol
- Hypertension
- Gout
- Low testosterone

### Movement Assessment

**Lifestyle already provides sufficient movement**:
- NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis)
- Functional fitness
- Occupational activity
- Daily chores, lifting, walking
- ~10,000 steps daily
- Hobby farm work

**Conclusion**: Diet is the primary lever for improving labs and healthspan.

## Constraints

- Grocery inflation in Nova Scotia
- Limited selection
- Primary shopping: Sobeys/Foodland (Scene+ points)
- Raises chickens (eggs & meat)
- Abundant garden pickles

## Struggles

- Bread (especially at breakfast)
- Evening snacking and grazing
- Secret junk food buys during store runs

## Positive Patterns

- Drinks black coffee
- Avoids soda
- Solo breakfast (anchoring opportunity)
- Works with Rhonda's meals (need flexibility)

## Doug's Default Day OS

### Design Principles

- **Not a "diet"** — a default operating system
- Target: ~80% adherence most days
- Low-friction
- Flexible
- Neutral awareness (not scorekeeping)

### Breakfast (Solo, Autopilot)

**Omelet (no bread)**:
- Sets daily tone
- Anchors the system
- Bread dropped intentionally

### Lunch

**Protein + Veg**:
- Portion control
- Bulk with vegetables

### Supper

**50/25/25 Plate Ratio**:
- 50% vegetables
- 25% protein
- 25% starch/carbs
- Include pickles (abundant garden supply)

### Evening Snack

**Structured, Approved Combo**:
- Crunch + salt + protein + drink
- Reframed from "guilt trigger" to "approved ritual"

### Store-Run Protocol

**Guardrails** (not confession):
- Ritual approach
- Private tracking
- Prevents secret junk food buys

### Food Logging

**Neutral Fitbit Logging**:
- Process, not scoreboard
- Awareness tool
- Reviewed weekly for trends (not daily judgment)

### Grocery Focus List

- Structured shopping
- Aligned with Default Day components

## Infographic One-Pager

**Produced**: PDF/PNG format

**Contents**:
- Condensed visual summary
- 50/25/25 plate diagram

## Open Loops

- More detailed 2-week Sobeys/Foodland meal rotation
- Refined PDF infographic (fonts, spacing, print-friendly) for fridge posting
- Potential expansion: "Approved Snack List" and "Store Run Protocol" as laminated checklist


## Neurodivergent-Friendly Habit System (from Health Coaching)

### Core Principles
- **Environment beats willpower:** Systems and cues, not discipline, drive change—especially for ADHD/autistic brains.
- **Friction and visibility:** Make healthy choices easier and default; make less-helpful choices less visible or more effortful.
- **No shame, no tracking traps:** Focus on small, repeatable wins, not perfection or calorie counting.

### Key Behavioral Strategies

#### 1. Water Bottle Habit Loop
- Place a water bottle in a fixed spot by the door.
- Every time you finish a dog-related task, grab/fill the bottle and carry it upstairs—hands occupied, snack impulse blocked.
- Track only: "How many dog trips included bottle → fill → upstairs?"

#### 2. Snack Friction & Ownership Boundaries
- If snacks must remain in the house, label those not for you (e.g., "Rhonda").
- Personal rule: "If I’m not hungry and it says Rhonda, I don’t touch it."
- Out of sight = out of mind: Move tempting snacks to less visible, less convenient spots if possible.

#### 3. Protein-First Early in the Day
- Prioritize 1–2 protein-forward foods before 1 p.m. (e.g., eggs, yogurt, cheese, leftover meat, shake).
- For breakfast: keep eggs, reduce bread (2 slices → 1 slice).
- For lunch: add a palm-sized protein to whatever is shared.

#### 4. Evening Snack Vehicle Swap
- Hummus is fine; swap pretzels/chips for softer, lower-carb options (cucumber, bell pepper, snow peas, cherry tomatoes, etc.).

#### 5. Sleep Hygiene by Environment
- Buy a manual alarm clock; charge phone outside the bedroom.
- No screens for the last 20 minutes in bed.
- This improves sleep quality, which reduces next-day cravings and supports metabolic health.

#### 6. Tracking for Neurodivergence
- Weekly check-ins (not daily): weight trend, side effects, energy, gout symptoms.
- Focus on process and outcomes, not rigid tracking or all-or-nothing thinking.

These strategies are designed to work with, not against, neurodivergent wiring—minimizing friction, maximizing environmental cues, and building sustainable, low-effort health improvements.
