## Lifestyle & Baseline Assessment

### Physical Activity
- **Occupation:** IT Manager, NSCC (sedentary desk work)
- **Daily Activity:** Fairly active on hobby farm despite sedentary job
- **Steps:**
  - Winter: 7,000-10,000 daily
  - Non-winter: Consistently >10,000 daily
- **Farm Work:** Functional resistance training (carrying feed, mucking stalls, lifting hay, pushing wheelbarrows, fence work)
- **Tracking:** Fitbit device

### Energy & Sleep
- **Pattern:** Generally tired all day
- **Sleep Schedule:** In bed 11pm, wake 6am (7-hour window)
- **Actual Sleep:** 5-6 hours (Fitbit tracking)
- **Quality:** Good architecture with CPAP; near-zero apnea events
- **Issue:** Sleep duration deficit contributing to fatigue and insulin resistance

### Eating Patterns
- **Breakfast:** Decent - eggs and something (protein foundation)
- **Lunch:** Typically carb-heavy
- **Dinner:** Full meal
- **Snacking:** Throughout the day; quality subpar
- **Evening Snacking:** Sporadic; sometimes heavy, sometimes not
- **Assessment:** Carb-heavy lunch + all-day snacking likely driving weight gain and HbA1c increase

### Beverage Consumption
- **Coffee:** ~1 pot of black coffee daily (no cream, no sugar)
- **Evening:** Switches to tea (hot beverage preference)
- **Hydration Note:** Coffee counts partially but has diuretic effect; prioritize plain water for Ozempic therapy (1.5-2L daily target)

### Weight History
- Autumn 2025: ~305-310 lbs
- January 9, 2026: **315 lbs** (doctor's scale)
- Recent gain attributed to holiday season

## Health Goals & Treatment Strategy

### Primary Goals
1. **Glycemic Control** - Lower HbA1c from 6.9% to <6.0% (target: below 7.0% minimum)
2. **Weight Loss** - Reduce overall weight to improve metabolic health
3. **Increased Healthspan** - Living longer and healthier
4. **Improved Energy** - Address chronic fatigue

### Expected Ozempic Benefits
**Primary:**
- HbA1c reduction of 1-2% over 3-6 months
- Weight loss 5-15% body weight typical
- Improved fasting glucose
- Reduced appetite

**Secondary cascade effects from weight loss:**
- Reduced blood pressure
- Improved cholesterol profile
- Decreased gout risk
- Improved libido
- Potential reduction in sleep apnea severity (may need CPAP adjustment)
- Possible improvement in natural testosterone (may need TRT adjustment)

### Hypothesis
Weight is primary driver of interconnected health issues (hypertension, cholesterol, diabetes, gout, lagging libido). Weight loss should create positive cascade effects across all conditions.

## Ozempic Therapy Protocol

### Dosing Schedule
**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4):** 0.25mg weekly - January 13 to February 9, 2026  
**Phase 2:** Increase after 4 weeks pending tolerance check  
**Pen Supply:** Single pen provides ~2 months

### Injection Protocol
- **Day/Time:** Monday evenings after darts
- **Rationale:** Side effects peak 1-2 days post-injection; Monday dosing = worst symptoms Tue-Wed, weekends clear
- **Location:** Abdomen preferred (better absorption, less painful than thighs)
- **Rotation Pattern:**
  1. Start bottom right abdomen (>2 inches from belly button)
  2. Move over 1-2 inches each week
  3. Switch to left side after 2 injections
  4. Move up above belly button line
  5. Continue rotation, then reset
- **Storage:** Refrigerate; stable 56 days room temperature if needed

### Managing Side Effects (Tina Buchner's Practical Advice)

**1. Never Overeat**
- If full, push plate away even with food remaining
- Risk: Severe heartburn and reflux if ignored

**2. Hydration is Imperative**
- Target: 1.5-2L water daily minimum
- Risk: Constipation, potential bowel obstruction
- Action: If no bowel movement entire day, take Milk of Magnesia
- Note: Most get constipation rather than diarrhea

**3. Combat Nausea**
- Drug slows digestive tract significantly
- Keep crackers on hand at all times
- Don't let yourself get too hungry
- Appetite suppression is strong, but hunger window is short

**4. Protein is Key**
- Target: 60-150g protein daily
- Risk: Muscle wasting without adequate protein
- Strategies:
  - Protein shake after morning coffee (Fairlife from Costco.ca)
  - Keep almonds and walnuts for protein hits
  - Avoid deli meat (high nitrates, sodium)

**5. Expected Changes**
- Cravings will likely stop
- Taste changes - some foods become unappealing
- May shift from carbs to preferring meat/vegetables
- Snacking may naturally decrease or eliminate
- Coffee/tea preferences may shift

**6. Timeline**
- ~4 months to stabilize on therapeutic dose
- Side effects may diminish or disappear after settling
- Variable response - some have no side effects
- 20% of people don't lose weight (but still get glycemic control)

## Key Monitoring Priorities

### Gout Risk (Primary Concern)
Rapid weight loss can temporarily increase uric acid levels
- **Monitor:** Joint pain, especially feet/toes
- **Mitigation:** Maintain allopurinol, aggressive hydration
- **Action:** Contact Dr. Sharma if flares occur

### Muscle Loss Prevention
GLP-1 therapy can cause muscle wasting without adequate protein
- **Monitor:** Strength during farm activities, Fitbit activity levels
- **Mitigation:** High protein (60-150g daily), maintain/increase resistance activities
- **Consider:** Bodyweight exercises (push-ups, squats, planks)

### GI Management
- **Monitor:** Bowel movements, nausea, appetite, comfort
- **Mitigation:** Follow Tina's advice (see above)
- **Note:** Unlike Xenical, Ozempic does NOT cause uncontrollable oily discharge

### Secondary Monitoring
- Energy levels (especially weeks 1-6)
- Sleep quality/duration
- Blood pressure readings
- Libido changes
- Appetite and food preference shifts
- Weight trends
- Activity level maintenance

## Tracking Strategy: Neurodivergent-Sustainable Approach

### The Perfection Trap Problem
Autistic systemizing drive + ADHD executive function challenges = "perfect tracking or no tracking" → system collapse

### Pragmatic Compromise: Outcome-Based Tracking

**Weekly Check-ins (Mondays before injection):**
- Weight (track trend, not daily fluctuation)
- Notable side effects this week
- Gout symptoms or joint pain?
- Energy level (better/same/worse)
- Bowel movement pattern

**Quarterly Medical Tracking:**
- HbA1c results (primary success metric)
- Blood pressure
- Medication changes
- Doctor feedback

**Protein Awareness (Not Counting):**
- Protein at breakfast? (yes/no - already doing eggs)
- Protein shake or high-protein snack? (yes/no)
- **Awareness, not rigid counting**

**"Trust the Process" Indicators:**
- Fitbit steps (automatic)
- Clothes fit (more useful than daily weight)
- Farm work capacity
- Quarterly bloodwork (objective medical truth)

### Why This Works for Autism/ADHD
- Reduces executive function load (weekly not daily)
- Satisfies systemizing (still tracking patterns)
- Avoids all-or-nothing trap (missing a week doesn't break system)
- Focuses on outcomes (HbA1c is the real measure)
- Leverages existing habits (Fitbit, Monday injection checkpoint)
- Respects both traits (structure + grace for inconsistency)

**Clinical Note:** The 3.5-month period from September to December 2025 showed significant metabolic deterioration (HbA1c 6.5% → 6.9%, microalbuminuria appearing), prompting comprehensive 5-drug regimen January 9, 2026. Ozempic initiation January 13 represents critical intervention for blood sugar control. Close monitoring over next 3-6 months essential to assess treatment effectiveness and manage potential side effects, particularly gout risk and muscle preservation during weight loss.
