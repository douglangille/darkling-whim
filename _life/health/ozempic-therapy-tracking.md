## Baseline Lifestyle Assessment

### Sleep
- **Schedule:** In bed before 11pm, wakes at 6am (7-hour window)
- **Actual Sleep:** 5-6 hours per night (Fitbit tracking)
- **Quality:** Good sleep architecture with CPAP; near-zero apnea events
- **Issue:** Sleep duration deficit (getting 5-6 hours vs needed 7-9 hours)

### Energy Levels
- Generally tired all day
- No particular midday slump
- Starts to fade in evenings unless actively engaged
- Early riser (6am)
- Sleep debt likely contributing to chronic fatigue and insulin resistance

### Physical Activity
- **Occupation:** IT management (sedentary)
- **Activity:** Fairly active on hobby farm despite sedentary job
- **Winter Steps:** 7,000-10,000 daily
- **Non-Winter Steps:** Consistently >10,000 daily
- **Farm Activities:** Functional resistance training through farm chores (carrying feed, mucking stalls, lifting hay, pushing wheelbarrows, fence work)
- **Tracking:** Fitbit device

### Eating Patterns
- **Breakfast:** Decent - eggs and something (protein foundation)
- **Lunch:** Typically carb-heavy
- **Dinner:** Full meal
- **Snacking:** Throughout the day; quality is subpar
- **Evening Snacking:** Sporadic; sometimes heavy, sometimes not
- **Assessment:** Carb-heavy lunch and all-day snacking (especially low-quality evening snacks) likely driving weight gain and A1C increase

### Beverage Consumption
- **Coffee:** ~1 pot of black coffee daily (no cream, no sugar)
- **Evening Beverages:** Switches to tea in evenings (hot beverage preference)
- **Hydration Note:** Coffee consumption to be considered against 1.5-2L daily water target for Ozempic therapy

---

## Ozempic Dosing Schedule

### Phase 1: Starter Dose (4 weeks)
- **Dose:** 0.25mg once weekly
- **Duration:** Weeks 1-4 (January 13 - February 9, 2026)
- **Pen:** Single pen provides ~2 months supply

### Phase 2: Therapeutic Dose
- **Planned:** Increase after 4 weeks (pending tolerance check)
- **Timing:** Starting approximately February 10, 2026
- **Follow-up:** Phone appointment with Dr. Sharma late February/early March before next prescription issued

### Injection Protocol
- **Timing:** Monday evenings after darts
  - Rationale: Side effects typically peak 1-2 days post-injection; Monday dosing means worst symptoms Tuesday-Wednesday, leaving weekends clear
- **Location:** Abdomen preferred (better absorption, less painful than thighs)
- **Rotation Pattern:**
  1. Start bottom right of abdomen (>2 inches from belly button)
  2. Move over 1-2 inches each week
  3. Switch to left side after 2 injections
  4. Move up above belly button line
  5. Continue rotation pattern
  6. Reset and repeat cycle
- **Storage:** Keep refrigerated; stable 56 days at room temperature if power loss

## Health Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Glycemic Control:** Lower A1C below 7.0% (currently 6.9%)
2. **Weight Loss:** Reduce overall weight to improve metabolic health
3. **Increased Healthspan:** Not dying; living longer and healthier
4. **Improved Energy Levels:** Address chronic fatigue

### Secondary Benefits (Expected)
- Reduced blood pressure
- Improved cholesterol profile
- Decreased gout risk with sustained weight loss
- Improved libido
- Potential reduction in sleep apnea severity (may require CPAP adjustment)
- Possible improvement in natural testosterone production (may require TRT dose adjustment)

### Hypothesis
Weight is primary driver of interconnected health issues (hypertension, cholesterol, diabetes, gout, lagging libido). Weight loss should create positive cascade effects across all conditions.

## Key Concerns & Monitoring Priorities

### Primary Concerns
1. **Gout Flares:** Rapid weight loss can temporarily increase uric acid levels
   - Monitor: Joint pain, especially in feet/toes
   - Mitigation: Maintain allopurinol, aggressive hydration
   - Action: Contact Dr. Sharma if flares occur (may adjust allopurinol dose)

2. **Muscle Loss:** GLP-1 therapy can cause muscle wasting without adequate protein
   - Monitor: Strength during farm activities, Fitbit activity levels
   - Mitigation: High protein intake (60-150g daily), maintain/increase resistance activities
   - Action: Consider adding bodyweight exercises (push-ups, squats, planks)

3. **GI Issues:** Nausea, constipation, diarrhea
   - Monitor: Bowel movements, comfort levels, appetite
   - Mitigation: See "Managing Side Effects" section below
   - Note: Unlike Xenical (orlistat), Ozempic does NOT cause uncontrollable oily discharge

### Secondary Monitoring
- Energy levels (especially weeks 1-6 during adjustment)
- Sleep quality and duration
- Blood pressure readings
- Libido changes
- Appetite and food preferences shifts
- Weight trends
- Activity level maintenance

## Managing Side Effects: Tina's Practical Advice

**Source:** Email from Tina Buchner (retired pharmacy tech, current Ozempic user), January 11, 2026

### 1. Never Overeat
- **Rule:** If full, push plate away even with food remaining
- **Consequence if ignored:** Severe heartburn and reflux
- **Action:** Stop eating when satisfied, not when plate is empty

### 2. Hydration is Imperative
- **Target:** 1.5-2 liters water daily minimum
- **Risk:** Constipation and potential bowel obstruction
- **Monitor:** Daily bowel movements
- **Action:** If no bowel movement for entire day, take Milk of Magnesia
- **Note:** Most users get constipation rather than diarrhea
- **Coffee consideration:** ~1 pot of black coffee daily counts partially toward hydration but has diuretic effect; prioritize plain water

### 3. Combat Nausea
- **Cause:** Drug slows digestive tract significantly
- **Keep on hand:** Crackers at all times
- **Strategy:** Don't let yourself get too hungry
- **Note:** Appetite suppression is strong, but hunger comes with short window to eat

### 4. Protein is Key
- **Target:** 150g protein daily (Tina's recommendation; minimum 60g per research)
- **Risk:** Muscle wasting without adequate protein
- **Strategies:**
  - Protein shake after morning coffee (Fairlife from Costco.ca - lowest sugar)
  - Keep almonds and walnuts on hand for protein hits
  - Avoid deli meat (high nitrates and sodium)
- **Priority:** Maintain muscle mass during weight loss

### 5. Expected Changes
- **Cravings:** Will likely stop (whatever you craved before)
- **Taste Changes:** Some foods may taste different or become unappealing
- **Preference Shift:** May shift from carbs to preferring meat and vegetables
- **Snacking:** May naturally decrease or eliminate
- **Beverage Changes:** Coffee and tea preferences may shift; some users report coffee tasting different or becoming unappealing

### 6. Timeline & Expectations
- **Settling Period:** ~4 months to stabilize on therapeutic dose
- **Side Effects:** May diminish or disappear after settling
- **Variable Response:** Some people have no side effects at all
- **Weight Loss:** Great side effect, but 20% of people don't lose weight
- **Example:** Tina's father on 0.25mg for years; lost 45 lbs for diabetes management

### 7. Evening Eating
- **Tina's pattern:** No eating after supper
- **Alternative:** If significant evening nausea occurs, small snack may help
- **Strategy:** Adjust based on individual response

### 8. Drug Safety
- **Storage:** Refrigerate; stable 56 days room temperature if needed
- **Visual Check:** Do not use if drug appears cloudy
- **Power Outage:** 56-day room temperature stability provides buffer

## Tracking Approach: Autism/ADHD-Sustainable Strategy

### The Perfection Trap Problem
Autistic traits + ADHD characteristics create specific challenges with tracking:
- **Autistic systemizing drive:** Strong desire for complete, accurate data
- **ADHD executive function:** Difficulty maintaining consistent daily routines
- **Combined effect:** "Perfect tracking or no tracking" thinking → system breakdown → "in the rhubarb"

### Research-Based Evidence
- **Food Journaling:** Doubles weight loss in studies (13 lbs vs 6 lbs average)
- **Daily Weighing:** Produces 6 kg more weight loss than weighing 5 days/week
- **The Catch:** Studies don't account for neurodivergent burnout from tracking demands or impact of autistic need for perfection meeting ADHD inconsistency

### Pragmatic Compromise: Outcome-Based Tracking

**Instead of daily perfection, track what matters to your actual goals:**

#### Weekly Check-ins (Mondays before injection)
- Weight (doctor's scale baseline, track trend not daily fluctuation)
- Notable side effects this week (brief notes)
- Any gout symptoms or joint pain?
- Energy level (better/same/worse than last week)
- Bowel movement pattern (regular/constipated/loose)

#### Quarterly Medical Tracking
- A1C results (the actual diabetes goal metric)
- Blood pressure readings
- Medication changes
- Doctor feedback and adjustments

#### Protein Awareness (Not Counting)
- Did you have protein at breakfast? (yes/no - you already do eggs)
- Did you have protein shake or high-protein snack today? (yes/no)
- This is **awareness**, not rigid counting to 150g
- Leverages autistic pattern recognition without ADHD tracking burden

#### "Trust the Process" Indicators
- Fitbit steps (already tracking automatically)
- Clothes fit (more useful than daily weight fluctuations)
- Farm work capacity (can you lift/carry as well or better?)
- Quarterly bloodwork (the objective medical truth)

### Why This Works for Autism/ADHD
1. **Reduces executive function load:** Weekly not daily decisions
2. **Satisfies systemizing:** Still tracking patterns, just lower frequency
3. **Avoids all-or-nothing trap:** Missing a week doesn't break the system
4. **Focuses on outcomes:** A1C and doctor visits are the real measures
5. **Leverages existing habits:** Fitbit already tracks, Monday injection creates built-in weekly checkpoint
6. **Allows flexibility:** Some weeks you track more, some less - system persists either way
7. **Respects both traits:** Structure (autistic need) with grace for inconsistency (ADHD reality)

### When to Consider More Detailed Tracking
- If weight loss stalls for 4+ weeks despite medication
- If A1C doesn't improve at 3-month check
- If Dr. Sharma specifically requests it
- If YOU feel curious and want data (not obligated)
- **Important:** Only if you can design a system that accommodates both the autistic need for completeness and ADHD inconsistency reality

**Bottom line:** Ozempic works through appetite suppression and hormonal mechanisms, not through your tracking perfection. Your body will respond to the medication regardless of whether you logged every meal. Track enough to spot problems and satisfy your need for patterns, but not so much that the system becomes unsustainable and collapses.

### Medical Team
- **Primary Care:** Dr. Sharma (diabetes, blood pressure, cholesterol, general health)
- **Urology:** Dr. Massaro (testosterone replacement therapy)
- **Informal Advisor:** Tina Buchner (retired pharmacy tech, personal Ozempic experience)

### Tracking Research Context
- Food journaling can double weight loss (Kaiser Permanente study, 1,700 participants)
- Daily weighing produces 6kg more loss than 5x/week weighing
- BUT: Neurodivergent considerations require sustainable approaches over perfect adherence
- Autistic systemizing + ADHD executive dysfunction = need for "good enough" tracking systems
- Ozempic's mechanism (appetite suppression, hormonal regulation) works independently of tracking rigor
- Quarterly A1C is the primary success metric for diabetes management
