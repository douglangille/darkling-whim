On Thinking...</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Creativity means thinking, albeit in <a href="being_different.htm">different</a> ways to perhaps you 
      usually think. But thinking it is, and much has been said about this 
      subject. Thinking <a href="change.htm">changes</a> what you are, how you feel and probably the 
      weather as well. So get that thinking cap on, and make <a href="certainty.htm">sure</a> it&#8217;s the right 
      way around! </p>

<p class="q1">&#8216;If you strike upon a thought that baffles you, break off from that 
entanglement and try another, so shall your wits be fresh to start again.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; 
<a href="../quoters/quoters_a.htm"><i>Aristophanes</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;If you think you can, you can. And if you think you can&#8217;t, you&#8217;re right.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; 
<a href="../quoters/quoters_a.htm"><i>Mary Kay Ash</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The happiness of your life depends on the quality of your thoughts.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; 
<a href="../quoters/quoters_a.htm"><i>Marcus Aurelius</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;I have always found that the man whose second thoughts are good is worth 
watching.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_b.htm"><i>James M. Barrie</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The key to <a href="success.htm">success</a> is to <a href="risk.htm">risk</a> thinking unconventional thoughts. Convention 
is the enemy of <a href="progress.htm">progress</a>. If you go down just one corridor of thought you never 
get to <a href="seeing.htm">see</a> what&#8217;s in the rooms leading off it. &#8216; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_b.htm"><i>Trevor Baylis</i></a> </p>

<p class="q1">&#8216;Think! How the hell are you gonna think and hit at the same time?&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; 
<a href="../quoters/quoters_b.htm"><i>Yogi Berra</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;No, no, you're not thinking; you're just being logical.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_b.htm"><i>Niels Bohr</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Never express <a href="self.htm">yourself</a> more clearly than you are able to think.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; 
<a href="../quoters/quoters_b.htm"><i>Niels 
Bohr</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Intelligence is something we are born with. Thinking is a skill that must be 
learned.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_b.htm"><i>Edward de Bono</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Don&#8217;t think. Thinking is the enemy of creativity. It&#8217;s self-conscious, and 
anything self-conscious is lousy. You can&#8217;t try to do things. You simply must do 
things.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_b.htm"><i>Ray Bradbury</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The important thing in <a href="science.htm">science</a> is not so much to obtain new facts as to 
discover new ways of thinking about them.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_b.htm"><i>William Bragg</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Beyond all our actions stands the larger shadow: How are we to choose 
between what we have been taught to think right and something else which 
manifestly succeeds?&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_b.htm"><i>Jacob Bronowski</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;With our thoughts we make the world.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_b.htm"><i>Gautama Buddha</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;All that is is the result of what we have thought.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_b.htm"><i>Gautama Buddha</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;We are what we think.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_b.htm"><i>Gautama Buddha</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;If I create from the he<a href="art.htm">art</a>, nearly everything works; if from the head, 
almost nothing.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_c.htm"><i>Marc Chagall</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;We owe most of our great inventions and most of the achievements of <a href="genius.htm">genius</a> 
to idleness<p class="q2" style="text-align: left"> &#8212;either enforced or voluntary. The human <a href="mind.htm">mind</a> prefers to be spoon-fed 
with the thoughts of others, but deprived of such nourishment it will, 
reluctantly, <a href="beginning.htm">begin</a> to think for itself-and such thinking, <a href="memory.htm">remember</a>, is <a href="originality.htm">original</a> 
thinking and may have valuable results.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_c.htm"><i>Agatha Christie</i></a> 
<p class="q1">&#8216;The fact is that if you have not developed language, you simply don&#8217;t have 
access to most of human <a href="experience.htm">experience</a>, and if you don&#8217;t have access to <a href="experience.htm">experience</a>, 
then you&#8217;re not going to be able to think properly.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_c.htm"><i>Noam Chomsky</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;To think is to live.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_c.htm"><i>Marcus Tullius Cicero</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;A &#8216;new <a href="thinking.htm">thinker</a>,&#8217; when studied closely, is merely a man who does not <a href="knowledge.htm">know</a> 
what other <a href="people.htm">people</a> have thought.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_c.htm"><i>F. M. Colby</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;I roamed the countryside searching for answers to things I did not 
understand. Why shells existed on the tops of mountains along with the imprints 
of coral and plants and seaweed usually found in the sea. Why the thunder lasts 
a longer <a href="time.htm">time</a> than which causes it and why immediately on its creation the 
lightning becomes visible to the eye while thunder requires <a href="time.htm">time</a> to travel. How 
the various circles of water form around the spot which has been struck by a 
stone and why a bird sustains itself in the air. These <a href="questions.htm">questions</a> and other 
strange phenomena engaged my thought throughout my life.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_v.htm"><i>Leonardo Da Vinci</i></a>
</p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;I think, therefore I am.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_d.htm">
<i>René Déscartes</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;<a href="failure.htm">Failure</a> is instructive. The person who really thinks learns quite as much 
from his failures as from his successes.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_d.htm"><i>John Dewey</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;We only think when we are confronted with a <a href="problems.htm">problem</a>.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_d.htm"><i>John Dewey</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Nurture your <a href="mind.htm">mind</a> with great thoughts.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_d.htm"><i>Benjamin Disraeli</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;A new type of thinking is essential if mankind is to 
survive and move to higher levels.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_e.htm"><i>Albert Einstein</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;We should take care not to make the intellect our god; it has, of course 
powerful muscles, but no personality.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_e.htm"><i>Albert Einstein</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Without creative, independently thinking and
<a href="judgement.htm">judging</a> personalities the upward development of 
society is as unthinkable as the development of the individual personality 
without the nourishing soil of the community.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_e.htm"><i>Albert Einstein</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The world we have made as a result of the level of thinking we have done 
thus far creates <a href="problems.htm">problems</a> we cannot solve at the same level of thinking at which 
we created them.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_e.htm"><i>Albert Einstein</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Reading, after a <a href="certainty.htm">certain</a> age, diverts the <a href="mind.htm">mind</a> too much from its creative 
pursuits. Any man who read too much and uses his own brain too little falls into 
lazy <a href="habit.htm">habits</a> of thinking.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_e.htm"><i>Albert Einstein</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The world&#8217;s greatest <a href="thinking.htm">thinker</a>s have often been amateurs; for high thinking is 
the outcome of fine and independent living, and for that a professional chair 
offers no special opportunities.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_e.htm"><i>Havelock Ellis</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Beware when the great God lets loose a <a href="thinking.htm">thinker</a> on this planet.&#8217;  
<p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_e.htm"><i>Ralph Waldo Emerson</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Every revolution was first a thought in one man&#8217;s <a href="mind.htm">mind</a>.&#8217;  
<p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_e.htm"><i>Ralph Waldo Emerson</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;If a man sits down to think, he is immediately asked if he has a headache.&#8217; 
<p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_e.htm"><i>Ralph Waldo Emerson</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Thoughts rule the world.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_e.htm"><i>Ralph Waldo Emerson</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;What is the hardest task in the world? To think.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_e.htm"><i>Ralph Waldo Emerson</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Thinking is the hardest work there is, which is the probable <a href="rationality.htm">reason</a> why so 
few engage in it.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_f.htm"><i>Henry Ford</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The more you think, the more <a href="time.htm">time</a> you have.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_f.htm"><i>Henry Ford</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Think before you <a href="words.htm">speak</a> is criticism&#8217;s motto; <a href="words.htm">speak</a> before you think

<p class="q1">&#8216;To cease to think creatively is but little <a href="being_different.htm">different</a> from ceasing to live.&#8217; 
<p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_f.htm"><i>Benjamin Franklin</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;We must care to think about the unthinkable things, because when things 
become unthinkable, thinking stops and <a href="action.htm">action</a> becomes mindless.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; 
<a href="../quoters/quoters_f.htm"><i>James 
Fulbright </i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;All truly <a href="wisdom.htm">wise</a> thoughts have been thought already thousands of times; but to 
make them truly ours, we must think them over again honestly, till they take 
root in our personal <a href="experience.htm">experience</a>.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_g.htm"><i>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;If I look confused, it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m thinking.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_g.htm"><i>Samuel Goldwyn</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Most <a href="people.htm">people</a> can&#8217;t think, most of the remainder won&#8217;t think, and the small

<p class="q1">&#8216;Every real thought on every real subject knocks the wind out of somebody or

consciousness.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_j.htm"><i>William James</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;A great many <a href="people.htm">people</a> think they are thinking when they are merely <a href="rearrangement.htm">rearranging</a>

<p class="q1">&#8216;The intellect can intuit nothing, the senses dcan think nothing. Only

<p class="q1">&#8216;The paradox is really the pathos of intellectual life and just as only great 
souls are exposed to passions it is only the great <a href="thinking.htm">thinker</a> who is exposed to 
what I call paradoxes.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_k.htm"><i>Søren Kierkegaard</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;<a href="people.htm">People</a> demand freedom of speech to make up for the freedom of thought which

<p class="q1">&#8216;Nature gave men two ends&#8211;one to sit on and one to think with. Ever since 
then, man&#8217;s <a href="success.htm">success</a> or <a href="failure.htm">failure</a> has been dependent on the one he uses most.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212;

<p class="q1">&#8216;Thoughts give birth to a creative force that is neither elemental nor 
sideral. Thoughts create a new heaven, a new firmament, a new source of energy, 
from which new arts flow. When a man undertakes to create something, he 
establishes a new heaven, as it were and from it the work that he desires to 
create flows into him. For such is the immensity of man that he is greater than 
heaven and earth.&#8217; <p class="q2"> &#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_p.htm"><i>Philipus Aureolus Paracelsus</i></a> </p>
