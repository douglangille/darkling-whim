<h3>Quotes<br>
</h3>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Every artist dips his brush in his own soul, and paints his own nature into 
his pictures.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_b.htm"><i>Henry Ward Beecher</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The ideal artist is he who knows everything, feels everything, experiences 
everything, and retains his <a href="experience.htm">experience</a> in a spirit of <a href="wonder.htm">wonder</a> and feeds upon it 
with creative lust.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_b.htm"><i>George Bellows</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The more I produce, the less I am <a href="certainty.htm">certain</a>. On the road along which the 
artist walks, night falls ever more densely. Finally, he dies 
<a href="seeing.htm">blind</a>.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_c.htm"><i>Albert Camus</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The dignity of the artist lies in his duty of keeping awake the sense of 
wonder in the world.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_c.htm"><i>Marc Chagall</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Lying in bed would be an altogether perfect and supreme <a href="experience.htm">experience</a> if only 
one had a coloured pencil long enough to draw on the ceiling.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_c.htm"><i>G. K. Chesterton</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The artist is not a man who describes, but a man who feels.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_c.htm"><i>E. E. Cummings</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The defining function of the artist is to cherish consciousness.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_e.htm"><i>Max Eastman</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;I am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my <a href="imagination.htm">imagination</a>.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_e.htm"><i>Albert Einstein</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The <a href="progress.htm">progress</a> of an artist is a continual self-sacrifice, a continual 
extinction of personality.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_e.htm"><i>T. S. Eliot</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Every artist writes his own autobiography.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_e.htm"><i>Havelock Ellis</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;A painter told me that nobody could draw a tree without in some sort 
becoming a tree; or draw a <a href="children.htm">child</a> by studying the outlines of its form 
merely...but by watching for a <a href="time.htm">time</a> his motions and plays, the painter enters 
into his nature and can then draw him at every <a href="attitude.htm">attitude</a>.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_e.htm"><i>Ralph Waldo Emerson</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The artists must be sacrificed to their <a href="art.htm">art</a>. Like the bees, they must put 
their lives into the sting they give.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_e.htm"><i>Ralph Waldo Emerson</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The true artist has the planet for his pedestal; the adventurer, after years 
of strife, has nothing broader than his shoes.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_e.htm"><i>Ralph Waldo Emerson</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;An artist is a creature driven by demons. He doesn&#8217;t usually <a href="knowledge.htm">know</a> why they 
chose him and he&#8217;s usually too busy to <a href="wonder.htm">wonder</a> why.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_f.htm"><i>William Faulkner </i></a></p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;An artist is completely amoral in that he will rob, beg, borrow, or steal 
from anybody and everybody to get the work done.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_f.htm"><i>William Faulkner </i></a></p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;What artists have accomplished is realizing there&#8217;s only a small amount of 
stuff that&#8217;s important and then <a href="seeing.htm">seeing</a> what it was.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_f.htm"><i>Mitchell Feigenbaum</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;All <a href="art.htm">art</a> is autobiographical.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; Federico Fellini </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The artist in his work ought to be like God in creation, invisible and 
all-powerful; everywhere felt but nowhere visible.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_f.htm"><i>Gustav Flaubert</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The scholar seeks <a href="truth.htm">truth</a>, the artist finds.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_g.htm"><i>André Gide</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The artist is not a <a href="being_different.htm">different</a> kind of person, but every person is a 
<a href="being_different.htm">different</a> kind of artist.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_g.htm"><i>Eric Gill</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;No artist is ahead of his <a href="time.htm">time</a>. He is in his <a href="time.htm">time</a>. It is just that others 
are behind the <a href="time.htm">time</a>.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_g.htm"><i>Martha Graham</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The real artist&#8217;s work is a <a href="surprise.htm">surprise</a> to himself.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_h.htm"><i>Robert Henri</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The moment you cheat for the sake of beauty, you <a href="knowledge.htm">know</a> you&#8217;re an artist.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_h.htm"><i>David Hockney</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;If <a href="art.htm">art</a> is to nourish the roots of our culture, society must set the artist 
free to follow his <a href="vision.htm">vision</a> wherever it takes him.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_k.htm"><i>John Fitzgerald Kennedy</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Above all, we are coming to <a href="understanding.htm">understand</a> that the arts incarnate the 
creativity of a free <a href="people.htm">people</a>. When the creative impulse cannot flourish, when it 
cannot freely select its methods and objects, when it is deprived of 
spontaneity, then society severs the root of <a href="art.htm">art</a>.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_k.htm"><i>John Fitzgerald Kennedy</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The artist deals with what cannot be said in <a href="words.htm">words</a>.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_l.htm"><i>Ursula LeGuin</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;An artist is only an ordinary man with a greater potentiality.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_l.htm"><i>D. H. Lawrence</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Dead he is not, but departed, for the artist never dies.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_l.htm"><i>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;With the pride of an artist, you must blow against the walls of every power 
that exists, the small trumpet of your defiance.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_m.htm"><i>Norman Mailer</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;A musician must make music, an artist must paint, a poet must write, if he 
is to be ultimately at peace with himself. What a man can be, he must be.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_m.htm"><i>Abraham Maslow</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;There is nothing more difficult for a truly creative painter than to paint a 
rose, because before he can do so he has first to forget all the roses that were 
ever painted.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_m.htm"><i>Henri Matisse</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Every production of an artist should be the expression of an adventure of 
his soul.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_m.htm"><i>W. Somerset Maugham</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The artist produces for the liberation of his soul. It is his nature to 
create as it is the nature of water to run downhill.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_m.htm"><i>W. Somerset Maugham</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The great artists of the world are never Puritans, and seldom even 
ordinarily respectable.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_m.htm"><i>H. L. Mencken</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The painting rises from the brush strokes as a poem rises from the <a href="words.htm">words</a>. 
The meaning comes later.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_m.htm"><i>Joán Miró</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;It is a mistake for a sculptor or a painter to <a href="words.htm">speak</a> or write very often 
about his job. It releases <a href="tension.htm">tension</a> needed for his work.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_m.htm"><i>Henry Moore</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The good composer is slowly <a href="discovery.htm">discovered</a>; the bad composer is slowly found 
out.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_n.htm"><i>Ernest Newman</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Every <a href="children.htm">child</a> is an artist. The <a href="problems.htm">problem</a> is to remain an artist once he grows 
up.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_p.htm"><i>Pablo Picasso</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;God is really only another artist. He <a href="invention.htm">invented</a> the giraffe, the elephant and 
the cat. He has no real style. He just keeps on trying other things.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_p.htm"><i>Pablo Picasso</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Good artists copy; great artists steal.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_p.htm"><i>Pablo Picasso</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The artist is a receptacle for the emotions that come from all over the 
place: from the sky, from the earth, from a scrap of paper, from a passing 
shape, from a spider&#8217;s web.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_p.htm"><i>Pablo Picasso</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;I don't paint nature. I <a href="being.htm">am</a> nature.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_p.htm"><i>Jackson Pollock</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Painting is self-discovery. Every good artist paints what he is.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_p.htm"><i>Jackson Pollock</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The task of the artist at any <a href="time.htm">time</a> is uncompromisingly simple&#8212;to <a href="discovery.htm">discover</a> 
what has not yet been done, and to do it.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_r.htm"><i>Craig Raine</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Those <a href="people.htm">people</a> who recognize that the <a href="imagination.htm">imagination</a> is reality&#8217;s master we call 
sages, and those who <a href="action.htm">act</a> upon it we call artists or lunatics.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_r.htm"><i>Tom Robbins</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The artist must create a spark before he can make a fire and before <a href="art.htm">art</a> is 
born, the artist must be ready to be consumed by the fire of his own creation.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_r.htm"><i>Auguste Rodin</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Today, each artist must undertake to <a href="invention.htm">invent</a> himself, a lifelong <a href="action.htm">act</a> of 
creation that constitutes the essential content of the artist&#8217;s work.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_r.htm"><i>Harold Rosenberg</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;An artist&#8217;s only concern is to shoot for some kind of perfection, and on his 
own terms, not anyone else&#8217;s.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_s.htm"><i>J. D. Salinger</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;If artists and poets are unhappy, it is after all because happiness does not 
interest them.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_s.htm"><i>George Santayana</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;An artist is a <a href="dreaming.htm">dreamer</a> consenting to <a href="dreaming.htm">dream</a> of the actual world.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_s.htm"><i>George Santayana</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;To send light into the darkness of men&#8217;s hearts&#8212;such is the duty of the 
artist.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_s.htm"><i>Robert Schumann</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The artist finds a greater plea<a href="certainty.htm">sure</a> in painting than in having completed the 
picture.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_s.htm"><i>Lucius Seneca</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;A true artist will let his wife starve, his <a href="children.htm">children</a> go barefoot, his mother 
drudge for his living at seventy, sooner than work at anything but his <a href="art.htm">art</a>.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_s.htm"><i>George Bernard Shaw</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;A creative artist works on his next composition because he was 
not satisfied with his previous one.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_s.htm"><i>Dimitri Shotakovich</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The worst scientist is he who is not an artist; the worst artist is he who 
is no scientist.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_t.htm"><i>Armand Trousseau</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;It seems to me it&#8217;s a painter&#8217;s duty to try to put an <a href="ideas.htm">idea</a> into his work.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_g.htm"><i>Vincent Van Gogh</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;I <a href="dreaming.htm">dream</a> my painting, and then I paint 
my dream.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_g.htm"><i>Vincent Van Gogh</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;An artist never really finishes his work, he merely abandons it.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_v.htm"><i>Paul Valéry </i></a></p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Contrary to general <a href="belief.htm">belief</a>, an artist is never ahead of his <a href="time.htm">time</a> but most 
people are far behind theirs.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_v.htm"><i>Edgard Varèse</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;An artist is someone who produces things that <a href="people.htm">people</a> don&#8217;t need to have but 
that he, for some <a href="rationality.htm">reason</a>, thinks would be a good <a href="ideas.htm">idea</a> to give them.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_w.htm"><i>Andy Warhol</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;An artist must be a reactionary. He has to stand out against the tenor of 
the age and not go flopping along.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_w.htm"><i>Evelyn Waugh</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;<a href="children.htm">Children</a>, like animals, use all their senses to <a href="discovery.htm">discover</a> the world. Then 
artists come along and <a href="discovery.htm">discover</a> it the same way all over again.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_w.htm"><i>Eudora Welty</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Good artists exist simply in what they make, and consequently are perfectly

&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_w.htm"><i>Oscar Wilde</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Bad artists always admire each others work.&#8217;<p class="q2">

<p class="q1">&#8216;No great artist ever sees things as they really are. If he did, he would
