On Resistance...</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Resistance is normal. Whenever you try to introduce something new, you 
      will get resistance. Just as a salesperson meets and overcomes objections, 
      so also must the <a href="success.htm">successful</a> creative person <a href="learning.htm">learn</a> to turn their creativity 
      to overcoming the resistance to new <a href="ideas.htm">ideas</a>. Nevertheless, it is still 
      really annoying. </p>

&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_d.htm"><i>Benjamin Dana</i></a></p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Old <a href="ideas.htm">ideas</a> give way slowly; for they are more than abstract logical forms and 
categories. They are <a href="habit.htm">habits</a>, predispositions, deeply ingrained attitudes of 
aversion and preference.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_d.htm"><i>John Dewey</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Great spirits have often encountered violent opposition from mediocre

&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_e.htm"><i>Ralph Waldo Emerson</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;These days, the <a href="problems.htm">problem</a> isn't how to innovate; it's how to get society to

&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_e.htm"><i>Douglas Englebart</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Man&#8217;s <a href="fear.htm">fear</a> of <a href="ideas.htm">ideas</a> is probably the greatest dike holding back human

&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_e.htm"><i>Morris Leopold Ernst</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Men are strong only so long as they represent a strong <a href="ideas.htm">idea</a>. They become 
powerless when they oppose it.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_f.htm"><i>Sigmund Freud</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Faced with changing one's <a href="mind.htm">mind</a>, or proving 
that there is no need to do so, most <a href="people.htm">people</a> get busy on 
the proof.&#8217;<p class="q2">

&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_h.htm"><i>Herodotus</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Our energy is in proportion to the resistance it meets. We attempt nothing 
great but from a sense of the difficulties we have to encounter, we persevere in 
nothing great but from a pride in overcoming them.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_h.htm"><i>William Hazlitt</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The real Antichrist is he who turns the wine of an <a href="originality.htm">original</a> <a href="ideas.htm">idea</a> into the 
water of mediocrity.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_h.htm"><i>Eric Hoffer</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The vast majority of human beings dislike and even dread all notions with 
which they are not familiar. Hence it comes about that at their first appearance 
innovators have always been derided as <a href="foolish.htm">fools</a> and madmen.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_h.htm"><i>Aldous Huxley</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Every great advance in natural <a href="knowledge.htm">knowledge</a> has involved the absolute rejection 
of authority.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_h.htm"><i>Thomas Huxley</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;First a new theory is attacked as absurd; then it is admitted to be true, 
but obvious and insignificant; finally it is seen to be so important that its 
adversaries claim they themselves <a href="discovery.htm">discovered</a> it.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_j.htm"><i>William James</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;So we went to Atari and said, &#8216;Hey, we&#8217;ve got this amazing thing, even built 
with some of your parts, and what do you <a href="thinking.htm">think</a> about funding us? Or we&#8217;ll give 
it to you. We just want to do it. Pay our salary, we&#8217;ll come work for you. &#8216;And 
they said, &#8216;No.&#8217; So then we went to Hewlett-Packard, and they said, &#8216;Hey, we 
don&#8217;t need you. You haven&#8217;t got through college yet.&#8217;.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_j.htm"><i>Steve Jobs</i></a> (co-founder of Apple Computer) </p>

&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_j.htm"><i>Samuel Johnson</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;<a href="mind.htm">The mind</a>, I have <a href="discovery.htm">discovered</a>, is very clever. As soon as it recognizes that 
it is entering territory where it is not in charge, it becomes very protective. 
It quickly begins <a href="invention.htm">inventing</a> <a href="rationality.htm">reason</a>s to stop, because it does not want to let 
go.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_j.htm"><i>Michael Jones</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;New ideas are not only the enemies of old ones; they also 
appear often in an extremely unacceptable form.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_j.htm"><i>Carl Gustav Jung</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Those who make peaceful revolution <a href="impossibility.htm">impossible</a> will make violent revolution 
inevitable.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_k.htm"><i>John Fitzgerald Kennedy</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Each time a man stands up for an ideal or acts to improve the lot 
of others or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope 
and, crossing each other from a million <a href="being_different.htm">different</a> centers of energy and
<a href="daring.htm">daring</a>, those ripples build a current that can sweep 
down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_k.htm"><i>Robert Kennedy</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;New opinions are always suspected, and usually opposed, without any other 
<a href="rationality.htm">reason</a> but because they are not already common.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_l.htm"><i>John Locke</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The human race is divided into two sharply <a href="being_different.htm">different</a>iated and mutually 
antagonistic classes: a smal l minority that plays with <a href="ideas.htm">ideas</a> and is capable of 
taking them in, and a vast majority that finds them painful, and is thus arrayed 
against them, and against all who have traffic with them.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_m.htm"><i>H. L. Mencken</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;An age is called dark, not because the light fails to shine, but because 
people refuse to <a href="seeing.htm">see</a> it.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_m.htm"><i>James Michener</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The greater the obstacle the more glory in overcoming it.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_m.htm"><i>Jean Baptiste Molière</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;There is no squabbling so violent as that between <a href="people.htm">people</a> who accepted an 
idea yesterday and those who will accept the same <a href="ideas.htm">idea</a> tomorrow.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_m.htm"><i>Christopher Morley</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;It is hard to let old beliefs go. They are familiar. We are comfortable with 
them and have spent years building systems and developing <a href="habit.htm">habits</a> that depend on 
them. Like a man who has worn eyeglasses so long that he forgets he has them on, 
we forget that the world looks to us the way it does because we have become used 
to <a href="seeing.htm">seeing</a> it that way through a particular set of lenses.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_o.htm"><i>Kenichi Ohmae</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Human inventiveness is overwhelming human adaptiveness. Our ability to <a href="judgement.htm">judge</a> 
lags behind our ability to create.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_o.htm"><i>Robert Ornstein</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;We have met the enemy and they is us.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_b.htm"><i>Ashleigh Brilliant</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;If anyone has a new <a href="ideas.htm">idea</a> in this country, there are twice as many <a href="people.htm">people</a> who 
keep putting a man with a red flag in front of it.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_p.htm"><i>Prince Philip</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Ah good taste! What a dreadful thing! Taste is the enemy of creativeness.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_p.htm"><i>Pablo Picasso</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;A new <a href="science.htm">scientific</a> <a href="truth.htm">truth</a> does not triumph by convincing its opponents and 
making them <a href="seeing.htm">see</a> the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die and a 
new generation grows up that is familiar with it..&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_p.htm"><i>Max Planck</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;But the fact that some geniuses were laughed at does not imply that all who 
are laughed at are geniuses. They laughed at Columbus, they laughed at Fulton, 
they laughed at the Wright brothers. But they also laughed at Bozo the Clown.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_s.htm"><i>Carl Sagan</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;If you are only skeptical, then no new <a href="ideas.htm">ideas</a> make it through to you.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_s.htm"><i>Carl Sagan</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The <a href="discovery.htm">discovery</a> of <a href="truth.htm">truth</a> is prevented more effectively not by the false 
appearance of things present and which mislead into error, not directly by 
weakness of the <a href="rationality.htm">reasoning</a> powers, but by preconceived opinion, by prejudice.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_s.htm"><i>Arthur Schopenhauer</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Opposition inflames the <a href="enthusiasm.htm">enthusiast</a>, never converts him.&#8217;<p class="q2">

<p class="q1">&#8216;There is a principle which is a bar against all information, which cannot 
fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance--that principle is contempt prior to 
investigation.&#8217;<p class="q2">

<p class="q1">&#8216;When a true <a href="genius.htm">genius</a> appear in this world, you may <a href="knowledge.htm">know</a> him by this sign, that

&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_s.htm"><i>Jonathan Swift</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;I <a href="knowledge.htm">know</a> that most men, including those at ease with <a href="problems.htm">problems</a> of the<br>
greatest complexity, can seldom accept even the simplest and most<br>
obvious <a href="truth.htm">truth</a> if it be such as would oblige them to admit the falsity of<br>
conclusions which they have delighted in explaining to colleagues, which they 
have proudly taught to others, and which they have woven, thread by thread, into 
the fabric of their lives.&#8217;<p class="q2">

<p class="q1">&#8216;<a href="mind.htm">The mind</a> likes a strange <a href="ideas.htm">ideas</a> as little as the body likes a strange protein

that a new <a href="ideas.htm">idea</a> is the most quickly acting antigen known to <a href="science.htm">science</a>. It we watch 
ourselves honestly we shall often find that we have begun to argue against a new 
idea even before it has been completely stated.&#8217;<p class="q2">
