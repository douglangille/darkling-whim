On Education...</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Education should give us the wherewithall to be creative, but 
      unfortunately it is often just a vehicle to turn creative <a href="children.htm">children</a> into 
      conforming adults. And once we have <a href="learning.htm">learned</a> to obey authority without 
      <a href="questions.htm">question</a>, we keep on doing as we are told (or doing what we guess that 
      others might want of us) for the rest of our lives. </p>

<h2>Quotes</h2>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Nothing in education is so astonishing as the amount of <a href="ignorance.htm">ignorance</a> it 
accumulates in the form of inert facts.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_a.htm"><i>Henry Brooks Adams</i></a> </p>

stops.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_a.htm"><i>Henry Brooks Adams</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;A professor can never better distinguish himself in his work than 
by encouraging a clever pupil, for the true <a href="discovery.htm">discoverers</a> 
are among them, as comets amongst the stars.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_a.htm"><i>Henry Brooks Adams</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The true teacher defends his pupils against his own 
personal influence. He <a href="inspiration.htm">inspires</a> self-distrust. He 
guides their eyes from himself to the spirit that quickens him. He will have no 
disciple.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_a.htm"><i>Bronson (Amos) Alcott</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The educated <a href="being_different.htm">differ</a> from

<p class="q1">&#8216;The roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is sweet.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_a.htm"><i>Aristotle</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;It's never enough to just tell <a href="people.htm">people</a> about some new insight. Rather, you 
have to get them to <a href="experience.htm">experience</a> it a way that evokes its power and 
possibility. 
Instead of pouring <a href="knowledge.htm">knowledge</a> into people's heads, you need to help them grind 
anew set of eyeglasses so they can <a href="seeing.htm">see</a> the world in a new way.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_b.htm"><i>John Seely Brown</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Age 7&#8211;Why? Age 17&#8211;Why not? Age 37&#8211;Because!&#8217;<p class="q2">

&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_c.htm"><i>G. K. Chesterton</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Without a gentle contempt for education no man&#8217;s education is complete.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_c.htm"><i>G. K. Chesterton</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;I began my education at a very early age - in fact, right after I 
left college.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_c.htm"><i>Winston Churchill</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Personally, I am always ready to <a href="learning.htm">learn</a>, although I do not always like <a href="being.htm">being</a> 
taught.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_c.htm"><i>Winston Churchill</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The one real object of education is to have a man in the condition of 
continually asking <a href="questions.htm">questions</a>.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_c.htm"><i>Mandell Creighton</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;One's work may be finished someday, but one's education never.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_d.htm"><i>Alexandre Dumas</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Education is a <a href="progress.htm">progressive</a> <a href="discovery.htm">discovery</a> of <a href="ignorance.htm">ignorance</a>.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_d.htm"><i>William Durant</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;I remember that I was never able to get along at school. I was 
always at the foot of the class.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_e.htm"><i>Thomas Edison</i></a></p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;It is, in fact, little short of a miracle that the modern methods 
of education have not yet entirely strangled the holy <a href="curiosity.htm">curiosity</a> 
of inquiry; for this delicate little plant, aside from <a href="stimulation.htm">
stimulation</a>, stands mainly in need of freedom; without this it goes to wrack 
and ruin without fail.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_e.htm"><i>Albert Einstein</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;<a href="wisdom.htm">Wisdom</a> is not a product of schooling but 
of the life-long attempt to acquire it.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_e.htm"><i>Albert Einstein</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;It is a miracle that <a href="curiosity.htm">curiosity</a> survives formal 
education.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_e.htm"><i>Albert Einstein</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;This coercion had such a deterring effect upon me that, after I had passed 
the final examination, I found the consideration of any <a href="science.htm">scientific</a> <a href="problems.htm">problems</a> 
distasteful for an entire year.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_e.htm"><i>Albert Einstein</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;We are students of words: we are shut up in schools, and colleges, and 
recitation-rooms, for ten or fifteen years, and come out at last with a bag of 
wind, a <a href="memory.htm">memory</a> of <a href="words.htm">words</a>, and do not <a href="knowledge.htm">know</a> a thing.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_e.htm"><i>Ralph Waldo Emerson</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;An education isn't how much you have committed to
<a href="memory.htm">memory</a>, or even how much you <a href="knowledge.htm">
know</a>. It's being able to differentiate between what you do
<a href="knowledge.htm">know</a> and what you don't.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_f.htm"><i>Anatole France</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The whole <a href="art.htm">art</a> of teaching is only the <a href="art.htm">art</a> of awakening the natural <a href="curiosity.htm">curiosity</a> 
of young minds for the purpose of satisfying it afterwards.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_f.htm"><i>Anatole France</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;<a href="genius.htm">Genius</a> without education is like silver in the mine.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_f.htm"><i>Benjamin Franklin</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Creative minds have always been known to survive any kind of bad training.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_f.htm"><i>Anna Freud</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Once they are through the process of education, most <a href="people.htm">people</a> lose the 
capacity of wondering, of <a href="being.htm">being</a> <a href="surprise.htm">surprised</a>. They feel they ought to <a href="knowledge.htm">know</a> 
everything, and hence that it is a sign of <a href="ignorance.htm">ignorance</a> to be <a href="surprise.htm">surprised</a> or puzzled 
by anything.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_f.htm"><i>Erich Fromm</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;<a href="genius.htm">Genius</a> will live and thrive without training, but it does not the less 
reward the watering pot and the pruning knife.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_f.htm"><i>Margeret Fuller</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;You cannot teach a man anything. You can only help him discover 
it within himself.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_g.htm"><i>Galileo Galilei</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live 
forever.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_g.htm"><i>Mahatma Gandhi</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;He who knows what he is told must <a href="knowledge.htm">know</a> a lot of things that are not so.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_g.htm"><i>Arthur Guiterman</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;<a href="common_sense.htm">Common sense</a> is in spite of, not as the result of 
education.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_h.htm"><i>Victor Hugo </i></a></p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;He who opens a school door closes a prison.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_h.htm"><i>Victor Hugo </i></a></p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The supreme end of education is <a href="on_experts.htm">
expert</a> discernment in all things - the power to tell the good from the bad, 
the genuine from the counterfeit, and to prefer the good and the genuine to the 
bad and the counterfeit.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_j.htm"><i>Samuel Johnson</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;An <a href="understanding.htm">understanding</a> heart is 
everything in a teacher, and cannot be esteemed highly enough. One looks back 
with appreciation to the brilliant teachers, but with gratitude to those who 
touched our human feeling. The curriculum is so much necessary raw material, but 
warmth is the vital element for the growing plant and for the soul of the child.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_j.htm"><i>Carl Gustav Jung</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;An inventor is simply a fellow who doesn&#8217;t take his education too 
seriously.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_k.htm"><i>Charles F. Kettering</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;There is frequently more to be <a href="learning.htm">learned</a> from the unexpected <a href="questions.htm">questions</a> of a 
child than the discourses of men, who talk in a road, according to the notions 
they have borrowed and the prejudices of their education.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_l.htm"><i>John Locke</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The important thing is not so much that every
<a href="children.htm">child</a> should be taught, as that every child should be 
given the wish to <a href="learning.htm">learn</a>.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_l.htm"><i>John Lubbock</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;School days, I believe, are the unhappiest in the whole span of 
human existence.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_m.htm"><i>H. L. Mencken</i></a></p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;A teacher who is attempting to teach without
<a href="inspiration.htm">inspiring</a> the pupil with a desire to learn is 
hammering on a cold iron.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_m.htm"><i>Horace Mann</i></a></p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The pupil who is never required to do what he cannot do, never 
does what he can do.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_m.htm"><i>John Stuart Mill</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;I respect faith, but <a href="doubt.htm">doubt</a> is what gets you an 
education.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_m.htm"><i>Wilson Mizner</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;My chief job is to constantly stir or rekindle the <a href="curiosity.htm">curiosity</a> of <a href="people.htm">people</a> that

&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_m.htm"><i>Akio Morita</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Education, the great mumbo jumbo and fraud of the age purports to 
equip us to live and is prescribed as a universal remedy for everything from 
juvenile delinquency to premature senility.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_m.htm"><i>Malcolm Muggeridge</i></a></p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Education is a method whereby one acquires a higher grade

<p class="q1">&#8216;<a href="children.htm">Children</a> enter school as <a href="questions.htm">question</a> marks and leave as periods.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_p.htm"><i>Neil Postman</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The principle <a href="goals.htm">goal</a> of education is to create men who are capable of doing 
new things, not simply of repeating what other generations have done &#8212; men who 
are creative, <a href="invention.htm">inventive</a> and <a href="discovery.htm">
discoverers</a>.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_p.htm"><i>Jean Piaget</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The bookful blockhead, ignorantly reads <br>

&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_p.htm"><i>Alexander Pope</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Thank goodness I was never sent to school; it would have rubbed off some of

&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_s.htm"><i>B. F. Skinner</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;It is because modern education is so seldom <a href="inspiration.htm">inspired</a> by a great <a href="hope.htm">hope</a> that it 
so seldom achieves great results. The wish to preserve the past rather that the 
hope of creating  <a href="future.htm">future</a> dominates the minds of those who control the

&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_r.htm"><i>Bertrand Russell</i></a> </p>

&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_s.htm"><i>George Santayana</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;My schooling not only failed to teach me what it professed to be

when I think of all I might have learned at home by myself.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_s.htm"><i>George Bernard Shaw</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;A <a href="foolish.htm">fool's</a> brain digests philosophy into folly, <a href="science.htm">science</a> into superstition, and
