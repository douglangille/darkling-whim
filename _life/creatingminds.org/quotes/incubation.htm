On Incubation...</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Graham Wallas, in his 1922 book &#8216;The Art of Thought&#8217; describe four 
      stages of creativity: <a href="preparation.htm">preparation</a>, incubation, <a href="illumination.htm">illumination</a> and 
      verification. Incubation means giving your <a href="thinking.htm">thinking</a> so far to your 
      <a href="subconscious.htm">subconscious</a> and then sitting back and waiting (or better, giving the 
      conscious <a href="mind.htm">mind</a> something useful to do. </p>

<h3>Quotes<br>
</h3>
<p class="q1">&#8216;I was on automatic pilot; <a href="ideas.htm">ideas</a> for gadgets kept coming, fed by a force of 
energy flowing through me and around me.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_b.htm"><i>Trevor Baylis</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Alas! I do not believe that inspiration falls from heaven.&nbsp; 
think it rather the result of a profound indolence.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_c.htm"><i>Jean Cocteau</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The poet is at the disposal of the night. His role is humble, he 
must clean house and await its due visitation.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_c.htm"><i>Jean Cocteau</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Patience is a <a href="necessity.htm">necessary</a> ingredient of <a href="genius.htm">genius</a>.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_d.htm"><i>Benjamin Disraeli</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;One should never impose one&#8217;s views on a problem; one should rather study 
it, and in <a href="time.htm">time</a> a solution will reveal itself.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_e.htm"><i>Albert Einstein</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;No great thing is created suddenly, any more than a bunch of grapes or a 
fig. If you tell me that you <a href="desire.htm">desire</a> a fig, I answer you that there must be <a href="time.htm">time</a>. 
Let it first blossom, then bear fruit, then ripen.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_e.htm"><i>Epictetus</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The air is full of <a href="ideas.htm">ideas</a>. They are knocking you in the head all the <a href="time.htm">time</a>. 
You only have to <a href="knowledge.htm">know</a> what you want, then forget it and go about your <a href="business.htm">business</a>. 
Suddenly the <a href="ideas.htm">idea</a> will come through. It was there all the <a href="time.htm">time</a>.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_f.htm"><i>Henry Ford</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The casual phrase dropped by a friend in conversation, the paragraph in a 
book, the incident observed by the roadside, has some special quality and is 
accorded a special welcome. But having been welcomed, it is forgotten or at 
least ignored. It sinks into the horrid depths of my <a href="subconscious.htm">subconscious</a> like a 
waterlogged timber into the slime at the bottom of a harbour where it lies 
alongside others which have preceded it. Then, periodically&#8211;but by no means 
systematically&#8211;it is hauled up for examination along with its fellows and, 
sooner or later, some timber is found with barnacles growing on it. Some morning 
when I am shaving, some evening when I am <a href="wonder.htm">wondering</a> whether my dinner calls for 
white or red, the <a href="originality.htm">original</a> immature <a href="ideas.htm">idea</a> reappears in my <a href="mind.htm">mind</a>, and it has 
grown&#8230;&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_f.htm"><i>C. S. Forester</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;I back away from conscious <a href="thinking.htm">thought</a> and turn the <a href="problems.htm">problem</a> over to my 
unconscious <a href="mind.htm">mind</a>. It will scan a broader array of patterns and find some new 
close fits from other information stored in my brain.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_f.htm"><i>Art Fry</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;If you happen to be one of the fretful minority who can do creative work, 
never force an idea; you&#8217;ll abort it if you do. Be patient and you&#8217;ll give birth 
to it when the <a href="time.htm">time</a> is ripe. Learn to wait.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_h.htm"><i>Robert Heinlein</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;<a href="problems.htm">Problems</a>, however, are rarely solved on the spur of the moment. They must be 
organized and dissected, then key issues isolated and defined. A period of 
gestation then sets in, during which these issues are mulled over. You put them 
in your <a href="mind.htm">mind</a> and consciously or unconsciously work at them at odd hours of the 
day or night &#8212; even at work. It is somewhat analogous to trying to place a name 
on the face of someone you&#8217;ve met before. Often the solution to a <a href="problems.htm">problem</a> comes 
to you in much the same way you eventually recall the name.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_h.htm"><i>Bill Hewlett</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The &quot;germ,&quot; wherever gathered, has ever been for me, &quot;the germ of a story,&quot; 
and most of the stories strained to shape under my hand have sprung from a 
single small seed, a seed as remote and windblown as a casual hint.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_j.htm"><i>Henry James</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The mystery of creation works this way: We work and plan and break our backs 
for it. And then, in the ashes of our struggle, it appears like a gentle wind 
rustling through blades of grass. To find it seems <a href="impossibility.htm">impossible</a> and yet, once 
here, it is as if it has always been this way.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_j.htm"><i>Michael Jones</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;<a href="learning.htm">Learn</a> to pause, or nothing worthwhile will catch you up.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_k.htm"><i>Doug King</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;You've been thinking about something without willing to for a 
long time...Then, all of a sudden, the problem is opened to you in a flash and 
you suddenly see the answer.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_l.htm"><i>Rita Levi-Montalcini</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Reverie is when <a href="ideas.htm">ideas</a> float in our <a href="mind.htm">mind</a> without reflection or regard of the 
understanding.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_l.htm"><i>John Locke</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;<a href="ideas.htm">Ideas</a>, I find, come most readily when you are doing something that keeps the 
mind alert without putting too much strain on it.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_l.htm"><i>Lenox Riley Lohr</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;In order to receive an &#8216;inspiration&#8217;or a &#8216;hunch&#8217; the person must first of 
all be intensely interested in solving a particular <a href="problems.htm">problem</a> or securing a 
particular answer. He must <a href="thinking.htm">think</a> about it consciously, gather all the 
information he can on the subject, consider all the possible courses of <a href="action.htm">action</a>. 
And above all, he must have a burning <a href="desire.htm">desire</a> to solve the <a href="problems.htm">problem</a>. But, after he 
has defined the <a href="problems.htm">problem</a>, sees in his <a href="imagination.htm">imagination</a> the <a href="desire.htm">desired</a> end result, secured 
all the information and facts that he can, then additional struggling, fretting 
and worrying over it do not help, but seem to hinder the solution.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_m.htm"><i>Maxwell Maltz</i></a></p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;A young man must let his <a href="ideas.htm">ideas</a> grow, not be continually rooting them up to 
see yow they are getting on.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_m.htm"><i>William McFee</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;I waited for the <a href="ideas.htm">idea</a> to consolidate, for the grouping and composition of 
themes to settle themselves in my brain.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_m.htm"><i>Claude Monet</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;When I am travelling in a carriage, or walking after a good meal, or during 
the night when I cannot sleep; it is on such occasions that <a href="ideas.htm">ideas</a> flow best and 
most abundantly.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_m.htm"><i>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;I was doing a campaign once for a manufacturer, and I couldn&#8217;t <a href="thinking.htm">think</a> of an 
<a href="ideas.htm">ideas</a>, and I was kind of desperate about it. The night before I had to show 
something to my client I had a dream, an interesting dream. I woke up and for 
once in my life I wrote it down and went back to sleep Next morning I went to 
the office and had that dream out into a TV commercial which is still running 
thirty years after and which has made that particular product the leader in its 
field.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&nbsp;
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_o.htm"><i>David Ogilvy</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Often when works at a hard <a href="questions.htm">question</a>, nothing good is accomplished at the 
first attack. Then one takes a rest, long or short, and sits down anew to the 
work. During the first half-hour, as before, nothing is found, and then all of a 
sudden the decisive <a href="ideas.htm">idea</a> presents itself to the <a href="mind.htm">mind</a>.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_p.htm"><i>Henri Poincaré</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;The worst is that the very hardest <a href="thinking.htm">thinking</a> will not bring <a href="thinking.htm">thoughts</a>. They 
must come like good <a href="children.htm">children</a> of God and cry, &quot;Here we are.&quot; You expend <a href="effort.htm">effort</a> 
and energy <a href="thinking.htm">thinking</a> hard. Then, after you have given up, they come sauntering in 
with their hands in their pockets. If the <a href="effort.htm">effort</a> had not been made to <a href="openness.htm">open</a> the 
door, however, who knows when they could have come.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_g.htm"><i>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;<a href="mind.htm">The mind</a> ought to sometimes be diverted that it may return the better to 
thinking.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_p.htm"><i>Phaedrus</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;I have found, for example, that if I have to write upon sum rather difficult 
topic, the best plan is to <a href="thinking.htm">think</a> about it with very great intensity&#8211;the greatest 
intensity of which I am capable&#8211;for a few hours or days, and at the end of that 
time give orders, so to <a href="words.htm">speak</a> (to my <a href="subconscious.htm">subconscious</a> mind) that the work is to 
proceed underground. After some months I return consciously to the topic and 
find that the work has been done.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_r.htm"><i>Bertrand Russell</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;There is a moment of conception and a moment of birth, but between them 
there is a long period of gestation.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_s.htm"><i>Jonas Salk</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;It takes a lot of <a href="time.htm">time</a> to be a <a href="genius.htm">genius</a>. You have to sit around so much doing 
nothing, really doing nothing.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_s.htm"><i>Gertrude Stein</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;You cannot go into the womb to form the child; it is there and makes itself 
and comes forth whole&#8211;and there it is and you have made it and have felt it, but 
it has come itself.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_s.htm"><i>Gertrude Stein</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;<a href="ideas.htm">Ideas</a>, like young wine, should be put in storage and taken up again only 
after they have been allowed to ferment and to ripen.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_s.htm"><i>Richard Strauss</i></a> </p>
<p class="q1">&#8216;Investigation may be likened to the long months of pregnancy, and solving a 
problem to the day of birth.&#8217;<p class="q2">
&#8212; <a href="../quoters/quoters_t.htm"><i>Mao-Tse Tung</i></a>
<p class="q1">&#8216;It is looking at things for a long <a href="time.htm">time</a>
