<p class="smaller"><i>I was asked to write a chapter for a book on creativity in 
my life. Here is what I wrote.</i></p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is a creative life? What makes one person seek challenge and difficulty 
and another stability and comfort? What drives those of us who follow the 'road 
less travelled'? This is a story of one grain of sand, a life of seeking and 
finding and further exploration.</p>
<p>I was comforted recently by a BBC television programme that highlighted how 
many leaders have disturbed childhoods and subsequently spend their adult years 
remaining separate, living life a little apart from others. As a child, I 
occupied that space. I lived on the edge of groups, neither wanting to be the 
centre of attention nor wanting to submit my independence to the will of the 
group or its leaders. In playing this role with the adaptiveness of youth, I 
found a useful space in which I could be an outsider-insider, challenging 
thoughts and actions in a way that others could not. Not quite the Shakespearian 
fool, but I certainly had sympathies.</p>
<p>To be fair, though, life was not that difficult. In a middle-class rural 
upbringing with fun-loving parents, imaginary play and games of wit were the 
order of many days. My father was remarkably tolerant of my hacking at bits of 
wood and making of crazy machines. Whilst not trying to teach me much, he 
allowed my imagination to run riot in his toolshed. A liberal upbringing with 
social tensions at school launched the rocket and I am still spiralling around 
the sky.</p>
<p>Living in a national park in Wales was good for me, and I spent many weekend 
days up in the mountains with my dog. Sometimes alone, I would sit on the 
highest peak and watch the miles of the world turning around me. Sometimes with 
friends we would play in the heather or dam the streams in the hidden valleys. 
An upbringing close to nature, I think, gives you a certain outlook on life. I 
still look for beauty everywhere, and of course find what I behold. I look out 
across the world and wonder. I take what is and try not to judge. One summer's 
day, I escaped a family argument, fled to the mountains and sat up a tree, 
thinking. I carved my name there and swore that I would always be tolerant of 
different views.</p>
<p>A teenage wakeup call from early-adult doldrums came in the shape of a summer 
job in a local factory where I discovered true boredom. Bing-bong, clink-clonk. 
After weeks of stultifyingly repetitive button-pushing and lever-pulling, I 
swore I would pull my thumb out and keep it out. I hated boredom then and hate 
it still.</p>
<p>There are three basic needs we all have (as described in the book I wrote 
with Dr. Graham Rawlinson - but more about that later). First, we have a need 
for a sense of control. I gained this both by maintaining a certain independence 
and also by working hard at my studies. If I could understand the world, then 
surely I could control it. I still read serially (I cannot remember not doing 
so) but along the way I realized the futility of a da Vincian effort to know 
everything. Somewhere along the line, pure knowledge has to give way to thought 
and exploration. So now I just try to do both.</p>
<p>The second need is for a sense of identity. Who am I, we ask. The ego, the 
id, the super-ego? From Freud to Maslow to modern neuroscience, we seek a 
feeling for a sense of self. Many people find it through who they know and how 
they are known. But social acceptance often comes at the price of conformance to 
social norms and obedience to social leaders. My friendships are with individual 
people from all walks of life, who accept me for who I am and let me be a little 
different. I am not a kook by any stretch, and as I write this on a train I am 
wearing the suit that my job demands. I do not need to show off to know myself. 
Well, not so much these days, anyway. I define myself through my family, my 
writing and my deeds. Being creative and being able to be creative is a part of 
that me. When I dream up (which I consider to be) a great idea, then I feel 
good. My sense of self is boosted. I am adding to the sum of the universe. When 
I write something and somebody on the other side of the world writes back to 
tell me how they were affected, then I feel as a bigger person.</p>
<p>The third need is for stimulation. Nature has given us curiosity to pull us 
forward and boredom to stop us sitting on our thumbs. My career has been one 
long search for stimulation. I have had many different jobs and have been lucky 
to work with many stimulating and thoughtful people. From the original 
electronics R&amp;D, I became a teacher, a software programmer, a quality 
consultant, a marketer, an HR consultant, a team leader, an M&amp;A programme 
manager, a business consultant, and am now working to improve the examinations 
systems in UK schools. In my 50s, I am also working on my fourth postgraduate 
qualification.</p>
<p>Why such a tortuous career? Taking Edgar Schein's 'Career Anchors' test, I 
found I have two key drivers: challenge and expertise. This effectively means 
that I am driven to become expert in any field that I enter, then get bored and 
seek a new challenge. When I move on, I don't feel particularly expert nor do I 
feel a jack-of-all-trades. I take pride in being recognized as competent, but I 
do not aspire to the pedestal of gurudom. I am particularly addicted to the 'aha's 
of learning, and when the light bulbs start to run out, I move on. This is not a 
bad strategy for creativity, as many innovations have come from people who bring 
a different way of thinking to an old discipline, often through lateral career 
moves.</p>
<p>A neat trick that effective leaders manage is to turn their early conflicts 
into a constructive tension that they use to pull themselves and others forward 
to new and (hopefully) better futures. There have been many tensions in my life, 
many of them self-generated, which I have used to goad myself down different 
avenues. The job changes above are typical. I also do it at the detail level, 
for example when driving I will constantly experiment with short-cuts (much to 
the frustration of my children) and am still working on improving my driving 
styles.</p>
<p>Another way I have managed tensions is through Tai Chi, which I practiced and 
absorbed for many years. Although perhaps the most effective martial art, it 
teaches you to sense the world around you and feel for alignment with people and 
situations. Hypersensitivity and projection are useful in many creative 
situations, and if you can put yourself into such bizarre places as tyres and 
oceans, you can solve problems as diverse as roadholding and racing yachts.</p>
<p>Along the way I found I could write, at least in a moderately acceptable 
fashion. After many years of believing that 'I can't write' I took the plunge 
and wrote a book on software programming style, which was reasonably successful. 
Other books on problem-solving and quality followed, and the most recent is 'How 
to Invent (Almost) Anything', written with Dr. Graham Rawlinson. In this book, 
we offer a range of creative toolkits and ways of thinking that range from 
structured and scientific to tinkering with the psychobabble of deep needs and 
beliefs. At the end, we bring them together into the 'TAO Process', which 
creates interconnected parallel streams of thinking that can lead to remarkably 
diverse and effective ideas and actions.</p>
<p>Teaching has also been a repetitive theme, from early school teaching to 
coaching and coaxing adults to get their brains in gear. There is no substitute 
for the light of an 'aha' in people's eyes (apart, perhaps, from getting that 
aha myself). In particular, teaching creativity and business improvement methods 
across the HP world helped me to understand the breadth of possibilities we can 
achieve, as well as the blind ignorance that high intelligence can bring. I 
would deliberately hold classes in non-business surroundings and use every 
method of stimulation I could, from games and videos to walks and meditation. I 
was learning as much as the people I was teaching and was equally surprised at 
what worked (and what did not). It was also a delight to see the amazement of 
people getting out of their box and finding that all but the most retentively 
anal can create with the best.</p>
<p>People you meet along the way can provide unexpected prods and ahas. I have 
had many teachers, most of whom would not recognize the role, as the essence 
came from what I gained perhaps more than the actual intent to teach. At school, 
I fell under the sway of a benign class philosopher who was reading and 
discussing Hesse and Kant at 16 and seemed hell-bent on curving the mind of 
anyone who would listen. My father-in-law's idea of fun was to make a 
controversial statement at the dinner table and then disagree with whatever you 
said, just to see what you would say next. In a software job, I worked with a 
no-holds-barred games designer whose specifications bore a close resemblance to 
cotton wool and who would not take 'impossible' for an answer. During many years 
in HP I was constantly thrown the latest in business thinking by corporate 
idealists. In later years, more than one consulting client demanded to be 
challenged rather than mollycoddled. My current boss likes bringing thinking and 
action together and has a favourite phrase: 'just do it'. And my children, at 15 
and 22 still ask 'why' (and 'why not'), partly, I hope, because I have always 
encouraged them to do so.</p>
<p>I have also learned creative thinking from a number of schools of thought. 
Alex Osborn's original book, 'Applied Imagination', though first published in 
1953 is still fresh and pertinent. Osborn was the Boston advertising executive 
who wrote a small book in 1943 called 'How to Think Up' in which he coined the 
term 'brainstorming'. Synectics puts right many of the limitations of 
brainstorming, and I met my co-author, Graham, who was teaching on a Synectics 
seminar I attended. I read Edward de Bono's 'Lateral Thinking' whilst still at 
school in the 1960s, and was perhaps the first place I found the notion of 
creative thinking as something you could learn. I went on Buzan's mind-mapping 
course in the 1970s (a useful method that slept during the 1980s only to 
reappear in the re-creative 1990s). And Graham introduced me to the marvels of 
TRIZ and TRIZ thinking, which is a step beyond the books and basic methods.</p>
<p>In my dotage, I will not lie down. I seek to pass on a love of exploration to 
my children (and hope I can do the same for my grandchildren, if and when they 
appear one day). I close my eyes when I hear my son blunting my tools in the 
garage and am genuinely amazed at the contraptions he produces. I am writing a 
book on design with my daughter and am relishing her enthusiasm and drive. I am 
delighted that my wife, an accomplished English teacher and relentless wearer of 
odd clothing, has put pen to paper and is writing novels.</p>
<p>I am also pushing on personal writing fronts. After suffering the author's 
frustration at publishers, I am writing high-content websites (now I'm in 
control!) and hoping for massive audiences (oh, the identity boost!) who 
occasionally click on not-too-intrusive ads (experimenting again) that give me 
some reasonable income. Do feel free to explore these. You can find a site on 
persuasion and change at changingminds.org. And, perhaps most pertinent to this 
writing, creatingminds.org is my creativity site where I am building what I 
intend will become the world's biggest site of creative tools, quotes and 
articles. Enjoy.</p>
