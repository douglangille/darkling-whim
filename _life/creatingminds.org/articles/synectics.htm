          <p>Around the same time in the 1940s that Alex Osborn was developing 
          brainstorming, W. J. J. Gordon was investigating the psychology of 
          problem-solving. He was later joined by George Prince at consultants 
          Arthur D. Little where they developed the basic principles of what was 
          called &#8216;Synectics&#8217;. In the manner of warring gurus, they later 
          disagreed and both left to set up rival versions of the process 
          (although for this article, the differences are too subtle to trouble 
          with).</p>
          <p>&#8216;Synectics&#8217; was derived from the Greek word &#8216;synektiktein&#8217; meaning 
          the joining together of different items and reflects the early 
          discovery of the synergistic effects of &#8216;banging things together&#8217; 
          where the creative equation of A + B = C illustrates how new ideas can 
          be created from two old ideas. Synectics these days is very much alive 
          and the methods are taught and used around the world.</p>
          <h2><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><a name="so"></a>So what is in 
          Synectics?</span></h2>
          <p>Synectics is a big bag of tricks, developed over many years. Not 
          surprisingly, as it is dealing with the same subject, many of the 
          rules and techniques are similar to many other approaches. Where 
          Synectics scores, however, is in the additional methods and principles 
          that it adds to get around the problems of such traditional techniques 
          as brainstorming. Thus, although Synectics sessions are often very 
          much like brainstorming, they are supercharged with additional 
          techniques to assist in even greater success. Some of these methods 
          are described here.</p>
          <h2><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><a name="hea"></a>Headlining and 
          in-out listening</span></h2>
          <p>When you are giving an idea, how do you do it? In many situations, 
          we tend to start with a preamble about the need for the idea, then 
          give the idea itself, then add further justification. The problem 
          comes when you look at what the listener is doing at this time. They 
          hear your initial preamble, and, once they have got the idea, start 
          thinking about ideas of their own. This means that just as you are 
          giving your idea, they have &#8216;gone inside their heads&#8217; and are not 
          paying attention!!</p>
          <p>This leads to two complementary principles. &#8216;Headlining&#8217; is simply 
          for the person giving the idea to state the idea up-front, adding 
          clarification only if it is called for.This, of course, requires an 
          environment of trust, which must be built before the session begins. 
          The other method of &#8216;In-out listening&#8217; is for the listener, who, when 
          they have an idea, write it down quickly so they can return to paying 
          full attention to what is being said, rather than rehearsing their 
          thoughts and trying to find a space in which to interrupt with their 
          suggestion.</p>
          <h2><a name="the"></a>The problem-owner</h2>
          <p>When brainstorming with a group of people, all of&nbsp; whom have some 
          ownership of a problem, the trouble that often occurs is that they can 
          all fall into judgement and evaluation at various times through the 
          process. This is simplified and sorted out in Synectics by having a 
          single problem owner, with all other people being there to help that 
          person solve their problem. Where those other people also have some 
          ownership of the problem, they can &#8216;take turns&#8217; at being the problem 
          owner.</p>
          <p>This also overcomes the problem of being blinkered by the situation 
          and the helpers should not know as much about the problem as the 
          problem owner, as this might lead to them becoming blinkered also. 
          This encourages &#8216;wild ideas&#8217; which, although on the face of it may 
          appear ridiculous, may in fact not be so silly after all or may 
          trigger other very valid thoughts.&nbsp;</p>
          <h2><a name="spr"></a>Springboarding</h2>
          <p>Have you ever been in a creative session where people do not seem 
          to be paying much attention to other people&#8217;s ideas? Springboarding is 
          a simple method of helping to trigger other ideas through the wording 
          of your idea. This is simply done by prefixing the statement with &#8216;I 
          wish&#8230;&#8217; or &#8216;How to&#8230;&#8217;. You can use other words like &#8216;Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice 
          if&#8230;&#8217; although these are longer. &#8216;I wish&#8217; and &#8216;How to&#8217; can also be 
          abbreviated when written down as &#8216;IW&#8217; and &#8216;H2&#8217;. Wishing tends to be 
          used for more speculative ideas and &#8216;How to&#8217; for more specific 
          problems, although people also tend to have their own preferences. </p>
          <p>Notice the difference that these suggestions have on your 
          inclination to add to them versus adding one of your own ideas: &#8216;Make 
          everyone understand&#8217; or &#8216;I wish everyone understood&#8217;. The &#8216;I wish&#8217; 
          probably leads you to think more about how that may be done.</p>
          <p>Wording ideas as springboards also acts as a psychological 
          legitimisation as it is easier to say things like &#8216;I wish the parcels 
          delivered themselves&#8217; rather than &#8216;The parcels should deliver 
          themselves.&#8217;</p>
          <h2><a name="exc"></a>Excursions</h2>
          <p>Have you ever been in a creative session where the ideas have dried 
          up, yet you are sure that there are more ideas that could be found, if 
          only you could unblock yourself somehow? Excursions are simply 
          exercises that drive up side-roads using different techniques to find 
          ideas off the beaten track that can be brought back and used like any 
          other ideas.</p>
          <p>Synectics makes particular use of analogies and metaphors, as these 
          give you access to whole new worlds which tend to be very rich in the 
          subject-matter areas which leads to many new ideas.</p>
          <p>For example, when looking for ideas on how to insert components 
          into a circuit board, you may take the principle of &#8216;insertion&#8217; and 
          take a journey into other realms, such as swords, which get inserted 
          into scabbards and other people! Shocking subjects can be quite useful 
          as they also jolt you out of the current rut you are in. Swords often 
          have a groove in to allow the blood to run along and act as a 
          lubricant. This principle could be applied to component leads, using 
          solder flux as the lubricant, leading to full soldering through a 
          plated-through hold.</p>
          <p>To discover more about Synectics, try the book &#8216;Innovation and 
          Creativity&#8217; by Synectics consultants Jonne Cesarani and Peter 
          Greatwood, and published in the UK by Kogan Page in 1995. Another 
          excellent book that is sadly now out of print is Vincent Nolan&#8217;s 
          &#8216;Innovator&#8217;s Handbook&#8217; (though your local library may be able find you 
          a copy). If you want to get back to the roots of it all, the original 
          book is call &#8216;Synectics&#8217; and was written by W. J. J. Gordon in 1961.</p>
