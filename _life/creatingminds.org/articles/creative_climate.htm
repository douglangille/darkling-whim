      <p>Creativity does not happen in an intellectual vacuum nor in the 
      emotional icebergs that many companies fashion for themselves. </p>

      <p>Research around creative culture and general climate has led to the 
      identification of key areas on which companies can focus to develop an 
      effective climate in which people are not only creative, but where they 
      are motivated to develop these ideas into value-adding contributions to 
      the success of the whole organization.</p>

      <p>If a company wants to become more creative, rather than just
      <a href="quo_vadis/quo_vadis_4.htm">encouraging</a> people or teaching
      <a href="../tools/tools.htm">tools</a>, then perhaps the best way is to 
      develop the organizational climate. Rather than telling the plants to grow, this is about 
      tending to the soil in which they can become what they are capable of 
      becoming. </p>

      <h2><a name="mot"></a>Motivation</h2>

      <p>To do anything, people must feel motivated, an internal need to act. 
      The climate of the organization thus must provide the cues and forces that 
      lead people into the deep motivation that is required to push through from 
      idea to end product.</p>

      <h3>Challenge</h3>

      <p>People feel challenged, that there is a basic drive to extend their 
      personal boundaries, develop latent talents and explore new possibilities. </p>

      <p>People who feel challenged emotionally engage in their work. It becomes 
      a part of <i>them</i>, not just something they do. They feel the need to 
      get out there and act, not just to sit back and dream or mope.</p>

      <p>Organizations can challenge people by linking a deep understanding of 
      individual talents, potential and motivation with the strategic intent of 
      the company. MBO (Management By Objectives) got itself a bad name in the 
      1980s, mostly because it was done badly. Done well, it means telling 
      people <i>what</i> is wanted (the Objectives) and then letting them do it 
      in any way they see fit. The trick also is in giving high-enough level of 
      objectives that people feel excited and challenged, not constrained and 
      directed.</p>

      <h3>Fun</h3>

      <p>Having fun is not always realized as being a productive state. Yet look 
      at little children. Their 'fun' is almost all learning and discovery. We 
      get this beaten out of at an early stage in school, where learning is 
      supposed to be serious.</p>

      <p>A climate where a certain (child-like, but not childish) playfulness is 
      in the air lets people try things out without knowing what will happen. </p>

      <p>Another important characteristic of a fun-loving culture is humour. You 
      can see such climates simply through the smiles that people almost always 
      seem to wear on their faces as they tease and joke with one another. Jokes 
      are about unexpected things, as are creative ideas. Making jokes is, in 
      itself, a very creative activity, and develops the 'creative muscle' 
      needed to constantly innovate.</p>

      <h2><a name="emp"></a>Empowerment</h2>

      <p>Once people are motivated to be creative, they need the environment in 
      which they <i>can </i>be creative.</p>

      <h3>Freedom</h3>

      <p>People empowered to act in ways that are not tightly constrained by 
      narrow job descriptions and management oversight. They have the personal 
      freedom of choice and resource that gives them true authority to achieve 
      the challenge they have been given.</p>

      <p>Empowerment has been slated and abused, for example where the power is 
      retained by managers whilst individuals are asked to achieve things 
      without the power to act. Done well, however, it truly delegates power and 
      the freedom to choose what to do and how to do it within a significant 
      part of people's jobs.</p>

      <h3>Time</h3>

      <p>Discovering and developing ideas takes time. They need to incubate in 
      your subconscious for a while, like hatching an egg or a dastardly plan. 
      When people are tightly constrained, working a full nine-to-five (or more) 
      job, then they will not have the ability to go beyond basic ideas, which 
      in their base state are usually not valuable, but would be with a certain 
      amount of developmental effort.</p>

      <p>When people have a certain amount of unallocated time in their 
      timetables, then if they feel challenged and feel freedom to act, then 
      they will use that time productively to develop those ideas. Some 
      companies deliberately leave a proportion of time, even up to 10% or more 
      (and particularly in some parts of the organization) in which ideas may be 
      developed.</p>

      <h3>Support</h3>

      <p>When I have spent time and freedom in working to achieve the challenges 
      I have found, then I will at some time reach the stage when I need further 
      help, for example to allocate additional resources for development or in 
      presenting the idea to people who may not be that ready to change their 
      entrenched viewpoint.</p>

      <p>In these situations, the person developing the idea needs the gravitas, 
      the authority, the wider capability of more senior managers. In fact the 
      more valuable the idea, the more support it is likely to need, as it may 
      lead to entire changes in direction for the whole company.</p>

      <h2><a name="dyn"></a>Dynamism</h2>

      <p>Alongside a motivated and empowered organization, a harder edge is 
      needed that drives forward towards towards success.</p>

      <h3>Energy</h3>

      <p>Getting an idea from first notion to final product can be a long and 
      arduous process. This requires a dynamic environment in which people are 
      energized and constantly pushing forward. You can walk into many 
      workplaces and feel the lack of energy and enthusiasm, whilst others have 
      a definite, almost palpable buzz about them.</p>

      <p>Buzz and energy comes from the leaders of the organization. This 
      includes the formal management and informal social leaders. People look to 
      these leaders for cues in how they behave. If the leader is full of energy 
      and enthusiasm, then this emotion will 'infect' others and the motivation 
      will spread through the organization. </p>

      <h3>Conflict</h3>

      <p>Ideas in action almost always bump into other ideas as well as natural 
      conservatism that seeks to preserve the status quo. People attach 
      themselves to idealistic positions and will act to defend them, sometimes 
      by pre-emptively attacking what they see as threats.</p>

      <p>A climate where conflict is allowed, enables these felt challenges to 
      be voiced and for people to argue their cases. In a creatively supporting 
      climate, the conflict is mostly about the problems of the organization and 
      the viability of ideas, and is most certainly not about personalities and 
      the value of different characters. When conflict turns to personal attack, 
      then ideas and their value go out of the window.</p>

      <p>Creating healthy conflict requires both an openness to challenge and 
      then a focus on the problem, not the people. A respect for the individual 
      thus is a fundamental element of creative cultures.</p>

      <h3>Debate</h3>

      <p>Conflict and debate are very close, and again the basic concern is to 
      focus first on the idea. In debate, the pros and cons of ideas are 
      discussed openly and challenges are welcomed and analyzed to see what 
      additional benefits they may bring.</p>

      <p>Debates can also go on across boundaries of time and space, and 
      thinking about an idea can engage an entire company.</p>

      <h2><a name="ope"></a>Openness</h2>

      <h3>Experimentation</h3>

      <p>It is one thing to think up a idea, it is another to put it into 
      practice. Ideas that are not explored and experimented with will either 
      never see the light of day or may well fail on their first outing.</p>

      <p>An experimenting culture has a strong bias for action in trying things 
      out. It does not expect things to work first time but it does expect to 
      learn through careful trials and subsequent analysis.</p>

      <p>Experimental companies often extend this culture out into the 
      marketplace. They do many trials with customers. They release many 
      different products to see what sells and what does not. </p>

      <h3>Trust</h3>

      <p>Trust is the bedrock of human interaction. If I do not trust others 
      then I will not believe them and will put a lot of my effort into 
      protecting myself from their potential attacks or callous lack of concern. </p>

      <p>In the development of ideas, trust is needed on both sides of the 
      house. The person with the idea must feel they can speak their minds 
      without fear of criticism or punishment. The person on the other side also 
      needs to trust that the person with the idea has the company's best 
      interests at heart and will not abandon their other work in the sole 
      pursuit of a very shaky idea.</p>

      <p>Trust thus has to develop across the organization. It is a fragile 
      thing, that when lost through betrayal of trust is not easily restored, 
      and thus needs very careful management.</p>

      <h3>Risk</h3>

      <p>Offering ideas and trying out experiments requires the ability and 
      motivation to take risks. Individuals and the entire company need to be 
      able to stick their necks out and 'give it a go'. Personal risk is thus 
      reduced so people can be open and experimental.</p>

      <p>Rather than blind risks, successful cultures manage these in a way that 
      takes a realistic view of the real exposure of the company. Big risks are 
      mitigated carefully. Small risks are recognized as such and may more 
      easily done as 'blinders' to see what happens. Risk and potential reward 
      are thus balanced and managed carefully as a single unit.</p>
