      <p>A popular perception is that creativity and old age do not mix. 
      Creativity is the domain of the young -- and to certain extent this is 
      true, yet not in the way that many of us would expect.</p>

      <h2><a name="dec"></a>The youthful decline</h2>

      <p>Our decline in creativity does not start when we are 40 or 50. It 
      starts around about the the age when we enter school.</p>

      <h3>The alarming decline</h3>

      <p>At around about the age of five, we are using about 80% of our creative 
      potential. We invent daily - no matter than our inventions have been 
      invented before, the fact is that we are innovating at a remarkable rate.</p>

      <p>The scary coda to this story is that by the age of twelve, our creative 
      output has declined to about 2% of our potential, and it generally stays 
      there for the rest of our lives.</p>

      <h3>The price of acceptance</h3>

      <p>And then we start to learn the price of living in the modern world - 
      which is conformity. To live with other people, you must follow their 
      rules and values, which seem to be more about what you <i>cannot </i>do 
      than what you can do. We are straight-jacketed and smart-stepped into 
      doing what others do and not reinventing our worlds every day. When 
      someone is being creative, they are also rather unpredictable, which can 
      make living with them an uncertain and perhaps threatening experience. So 
      we are taught to be polite and be nice to people, including not scaring 
      them with our creative thoughts.</p>

      <h3>Scholastic thinking</h3>

      <p>Schools, also and especially, drill conformity into us. We learn that 
      there is one true way of thinking. We learn that there is one right answer 
      for every problem, and that this is the one in the teacher's head. Success 
      is based on knowing what is wanted, not what is interesting. We are told 
      to 'Read The Question' in 
      essays and examinations. Marks are awarded for nice writing and regurgitation, not 
      for creative and lateral thinking.</p>

      <p>Universities are often worse than high-schools which are worse than 
      junior schools. At University, we learn to reference every assertion and 
      never, never to question the wisdom and ultimate knowledge of our 
      professors.</p>

      <p>By the time we leave full-time education, we are functional members of 
      society, but our creative potential has been very largely stifled. The 
      good and great have commented on this in the
      <a href="../quotes/education.htm">quotations on education</a>. There is 
      even a whole school of philosophy (Conventionalism) that describes how new 
      knowledge is constrained.</p>

      <p>A caveat: Academic knowledge is not bad. In fact much of it is very 
      interesting and can be used in many ways. It is just that when all you 
      learn is to <i>know </i>and to repeat knowledge, then there is little 
      creativity going on.</p>

      <h2><a name="tra"></a>The traps of adulthood</h2>

      <p>As adults, we do become less creative, but not in the traditional way. 
      Our continued creative decline is more due to falling into a number of 
      cognitive traps than the fading of old age.</p>

      <h3>Habitual ossification</h3>

      <p>Where creativity does fade away is when we do not use it. 'Use it or 
      lose it', as they say. One of the biggest culprits here is the simple 
      pattern of human habit. Once we start doing something one way, we get 
      comfortable with it and then do not change or vary it. We find the best 
      route home and then we always drive that way, even if it is choked with 
      traffic.</p>

      <p>We also get stuck in clichés and familiar conversations. Few of us read 
      much ('Too busy!'), fewer of us continue to study and fewer still innovate 
      for the fun of it. </p>

      <h3>The expert trap</h3>

      <p>Those of us who do study and become experts can easily fall into the 
      expert trap, where experts can spend more time defending their hill than 
      building it further. <a href="../quotes/by_experts.htm">Here are some 
      quotes</a> by experts who should have known better, but were too busy 
      being expert. And <a href="../quotes/on_experts.htm">here are more quotes</a> 
      about what experts should really do.</p>

      <p>We repeat this in our roles in organizations. When you are a manager, 
      you find you have the rapt attention of everyone below you, and it is very 
      easy to assume that they are in thrall of your intelligence and wisdom. 
      The trap here is to assume that you are all-knowing and to pronounce with 
      great certainty on all and sundry. It is also a trap to feel obliged to 
      the expectations of knowledge that others put upon you and feel unable to 
      say 'I don't know, let's give it a try'. Managers must manage, as they 
      say.</p>

      <p>And the cycle repeats at home, where parents take a similar role, being 
      the fount of all knowledge for their children, who learn that being an 
      adult means being certain and certainly not being creative.</p>

      <h3>Unintelligent closure</h3>

      <p>Intelligence is, to some extent related to creativity, and brighter 
      people generally are able to be more creative. Although a funny thing 
      happens at around an IQ figure of 120, as described in Edward de Bono's 
      book, <i>Serious Creativity</i>. Above this level, creativity seems to 
      drop off. This is quite probably due to these people falling into the 
      expert trap. </p>

      <p>Another reason is the premature closure of quick thinking, where bright 
      people 'get it' in seconds flat and hence stop any further divergent 
      thinking. Guy Claxton, in his book <i>Hare Brain, Tortoise Mind</i>, tells 
      of the benefits of slower and more exploratory thinking.</p>

      <h2><a name="sta"></a>Staying creative</h2>

      <p>The secret of life is staying creative. Keep your creative juices 
      flowing and you will stay ahead of the pack.</p>

      <h3>Do different things</h3>

      <p>The best way of staving off creative ossification is to keep 
      doing different things. Read different books and papers. Go to different 
      places for your holidays. Talk to different people. Listen to them and 
      seek to synergize and synthesize. Take every opportunity to regenerate 
      your generative powers.</p>

      <h3>The not-so geriatric effect</h3>

      <p>But what about the effects of aging. We are born with a fixed number of 
      brain cells and they increasingly die off* after the age of 50, and even 
      faster beyond 70.</p>

      <p>This may be true, but, barring mental illness, the effect is miniscule in 
      comparison with the habitual ossification effect. People who have stayed 
      creative through their lives are way above others, not only people on the final lap 
      but also those much younger than them. With practice, you can get <i>
      better </i>at creativity, which puts a creatively active 60 year old 
      streets ahead of a stultified 30 year old.</p>

      <p>Creativity even affects longevity. It has been proven that people who 
      stay mentally active live longer even than those who stay physically 
      active. If you go to the mental gym every day, then your alertness will 
      keep you going longer.</p>
<h2>*A coda</h2>
<p>Nelles Hamilton has kindly informed me that: &quot;The latest from molecular 
biologists is that brain cells and neural pathways are created daily at a pace 
that results in what essentially is an entirely new brain structure every few 
months. For that matter, our bodies&#8212;even our bones&#8212;are similarly rebuilt, 
molecule by molecule, every couple of years, and, in the case of our stomach 
linings, every couple of days.&quot;</p>
<p>A scary effect! Regeneration raises questions about how memories and 
capabilities are sustained, although I suspect that the 'use it or lose it' 
principle is still true.</p>
<p><i>(A later note: I attended lecture on neurogenesis and the lecturer 
informed me that sadly this effect, of neuronal birth, declines with age).</i></p>
