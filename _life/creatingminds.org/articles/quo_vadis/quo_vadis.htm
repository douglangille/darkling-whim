    <P>&nbsp;</p>
    <P>Frederick Taylor both advanced and 
    froze management thinking with his &#8216;scientific management&#8217; that focused 
    solely on the task, relegating the worker to the machine. It is perhaps not 
    surprising that Taylor was himself psychologically stunted will all the 
    hallmarks of a disturbed, neurotic, anal-compulsive personality<sup>2</sup>. 
    His very focus on efficiency blinded him to the inhumanity of many of his 
    proposals, which were deeply unpopular even in his own day.</p>
    <P>&nbsp;</p>
    <P>Yet Taylor&#8217;s legacy persists, 
    despite the real and well-publicised concerns highlighted by people such as 
    Douglas McGregor<sup>3</sup> (Theory X and Theory Y) and Hertzberg<sup>4</sup> 
    (Motivation-Hygiene theory). Perhaps it is because it appeals so much to our 
    deep needs for control that many managers still stubbornly resist the notion 
    that people can successfully think for themselves. It also is alluringly 
    attractive for managers to assume that they have greater wisdom and creative 
    ability than their charges. The notion of their subordinates having greater 
    intelligence can be perceived as a threat to be suppressed rather than a 
    skill to be encouraged.</p>
    <P>&nbsp;</p>
    <P>Going further back, the blame might 
    even be laid at the door of the Christian church, where the constraints of 
    the scriptures and their interpretation by a controlling clergy forbade 
    innovation for many centuries. In 1634, Galileo was forced to recant his 
    heresy about the place of the Earth in the firmament thus:</p>
    <P>&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p style="line-height: 150%" class="arial">&#8220;I Galileo, 
    being in my seventieth year, being a prisoner on my knees, and before your 
    Eminences, having before my eyes the Holy Gospel, which I touch with my 
    hands, abjure, curse and detest the errors and the heresy of the movement of 
    the earth.&#8221;<sup>5</sup></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <P>This &#8216;Management by Fear&#8217; results in 
    creative abilities being displaced either towards disruptive activities such 
    as strikes and other unhelpful actions or in hobbies outside the workplace 
    which range from flower-arranging to fly fishing. W. Edwards Deming&#8217;s 
    exhortation to management to &#8216;Drive out fear&#8217;<sup>6</sup> is a critical 
    first step towards bringing innovation into the workplace.</p>
    <P>&nbsp;</p>
    <P>What official innovation there is in 
    such <i>Suppressed </i>companies, is very largely product-oriented, contained and focused 
    inwards. Individuals using innovation of any kind are also likely to keep it 
    to themselves, for fear of punishment for stepping outside the rules.</p>

    <p>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    In an organisation where innovation is <i>Enabled</i>, the basic 
    culture contains rules that give permission to be creative, but provide 
    limited assistance or direction with the task. This seems a small step, but 
    it can have a powerful effect on the innovation within companies. Many 
    significant innovations have come from unofficial projects where people were 
    simply allowed to continue work on pet projects.</p>
    <P>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    The &#8216;skunkworks&#8217;, popularised by Peters and Waterman is 
    an example of enabled &#8216;official unofficial&#8217; work, where people are allowed 
    to work on projects either in their own time or outside of the main research 
    activity.</p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p style="line-height: 150%" class="arial">&#8220;Last year a major corporate product 
    bombed. A skunk works member asked for and got permission to take two 
    samples home and set them up in his basement. He used one as a benchmark. He 
    tinkered with the other for about three weeks and corrected virtually all of 
    the flaws (with nickel and dime items), actually improving performance over 
    original design specs by a factor of three. The president visited the 
    basement and approved design changes on the spot.&#8221; <sup>8</sup></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <P>Skunkworks and indeed most 
    innovation in the Enabled organisation seem to work largely through 
    intrinsic motivation. As Kohn<sup>9</sup> has shown, promised reward is 
    neither a motivator nor any guarantee for innovative success. The 
    impoverished conditions of the typical skunkworks seems to be an important 
    ingredient for creativity. Finke et al.<sup>10</sup> report on increased 
    creativity when conditions are restricted and Fritz<sup>11</sup> describes 
    the power of creative tension as internally generated desire pulls people 
    forward.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <P>For such private projects to work, 
    the domain of innovation needs to be close to the skills and interests of 
    the people working on them. Innovating to order in more distant fields is 
    neither of interest nor practical at this maturity level, where managers 
    studiously ignore much innovation activity, allowing people to come up with 
    ideas on their own.</p>

      </center>
    </div>
    <P>&nbsp;</p>
    <P>At the level of <i>Encouraged</i> 
    innovation, the creative skills of most people in the organisation are 
    actively sought as the viewpoint around innovation has expanded from a 
    primarily product focus to wider work processes. </p>
    <P>&nbsp;</p>
    <P>Many companies reached this level in 
    the late 80s and early to mid 90s, when the recession of the time, along 
    with increasing need to offer quality as a basic, essential forced serious 
    work in changing the culture to a more humanistic, empowered environment. 
    Total Quality Management<sup>12</sup> was the &#8216;fad&#8217; that triggered many such 
    change efforts. It really was a great effort for many organisations as they 
    tried to vault directly from a Suppressed organisation to the Encouraged 
    level of maturity.</p>
    <p class="MsoListBullet">&nbsp;</p>
    <P>Innovation at this level often 
    follows analytic work. The classic quality improvement project involves 
    measuring the process, analysing to find root causes and then finding an 
    innovative solution to fix the underlying problem (for example as in Straker<sup>13</sup>).</p>
    <P>&nbsp;</p>
    <P>The primary tool that is commonly 
    used here is classic Brainstorming&#8211;which is often used incorrectly, 
    typically collecting a few logical ideas, rather than being a wide-ranging 
    exploration of creative possibilities. Few people who use or facilitate 
    brainstorming have ever read Alex Osborn&#8217;s original work14, and 
    fewer still abide by his rules. It also comes as a surprise to many people 
    that Brainstorming as is commonly practised can be less efficient than 
    individual critical thinking.</p>
    <P>&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p style="line-height: 150%" class="arial">&quot;An extensive body of research shows 
    that for both quality and creativity, brainstorming groups seldom are more 
    effective, and certainly less efficient than individuals&#8211;even when redundant 
    ideas by individuals are not counted.&quot;<sup>15</sup></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <P>Still, the TQM activity has resulted 
    in major gains for a significant number of companies (although there has 
    also been the usual crop of casualties along the path of change). The 
    dilemma that many of these companies now face is that they have done the 
    easy work, having picked the low-hanging fruit amongst their business 
    problems. They are now left with difficult problems and short-lived 
    advantage as global competition continues to escalate.</p>
    <P>&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p style="line-height: 150%" class="arial">&#8220;The workplace is demanding more 
    innovation and creativity. That&#8217;s a fundamental shift from five years ago, 
    when the focus was on reengineering and efficiency.&#8221; <sup>16</sup></p>
    </blockquote>
    <P>&nbsp;</p>
    <P>In some ways, it is possible for 
    this level to become a retrogressive step from the previous level, if the 
    intrinsic motivation of the Enabled organisation is replaced by reward for 
    improvements made. Well-meaning compensation of a proportion of costs saved 
    has resulted in large payouts and a focus on the immediate reward rather 
    than the longer-term and whole-company benefits.</p>

    <P>&nbsp;</p>
    <P>At the <i>Educated</i> level of maturity, 
    innovation is a critical agenda in its own right, sufficiently so to warrant 
    direct expenditure on training and for the domain of focus to expand to 
    include other areas of the company&#8217;s interest. People are now being asked to 
    help the whole company with ideas, rather than just to improve their limited 
    part of it, as in the previous stage, consequently the creative domain might 
    be more distant from the creator than previous maturity levels. For example, 
    a receptionist might sit in a marketing creative session, adding hybrid 
    vigour with ideas such as how to make customers feel comfortable when 
    starting to use new products.</p>
    <P>&nbsp;</p>
    <P>To increase creative and innovative 
    skills, people are trained on a range of tools and techniques, either to 
    stimulate general creative thinking or for specific use in creative problem 
    solving. There are several schools of thought, each with books and training 
    courses ready and waiting in the wings, including de Bono<sup>17</sup>, 
    Synectics<sup>18</sup> and Osborn&#8217;s legacy organisation, the Creative 
    Education Foundation<sup>19</sup>.</p>
    <P>&nbsp;</p>
    <P>In many ways the transition from 
    Encouraged to Educated is not as difficult as previous transitions as it 
    requires limited cultural change, although being creative may require a more 
    significant change in openness than was previously permissible in the 
    company culture. This is mitigated by the tendency at this level to 
    constrain the creative thinking to specific problem-solving sessions, where 
    the psychological safety and freedom<sup>20</sup> required may be controlled 
    by a trained facilitator.</p>
    <P>&nbsp;</p>
    <P>A problem at this stage is that, 
    when working in groups, people who have not been trained in the approaches 
    are likely to find it difficult to pick up the new methods on the fly, 
    especially where different modes of thinking are required. The trained 
    people may also be inhibited by the presence of the untrained people.

    <P>To maximally achieve in any activity 
    requires getting back to the fundamentals of how things work. Athletes study 
    physiology, artists study light and materials, and  people who wish to 
    develop real creativity and innovation in their organizations must 
    ultimately study psychology and neurology in order to truly understand how 
    creative thinking works.</p>
    <P>&nbsp;</p>
    <P>Factors that need to be taken into 
    account include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
    <p class="MsoListBullet">Personal change. It is a difficult task to 
    study and change oneself, as this is first-order change from within. To make 
    a lasting, second order change to ourselves requires that they step outside 
    and look back in<sup>21</sup>.&nbsp; </p>
      </li>
      <li>
    <p class="MsoListBullet">Psychological blocks. Adams<sup>22</sup> 
    and others have listed many internal and external factors that act to reduce 
    our creative potential, from environmental and cultural blocks onwards.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
    <p class="MsoListBullet">Deep drivers, such as Maslow&#8217;s hierarchy of 
    prepotence<sup>23</sup> and Argyris&#8217; Model 1 Theory in Use<sup>24</sup>, 
    which tend to make us less creative and the double-loop learning that is 
    required to help us get out of the mire.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
    <p class="MsoListBullet">The effects of early childhood and 
    education, and models that help to understand this, such as Transactional 
    Analysis<sup>25</sup>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
    <p class="MsoListBullet">Various other dysfunctional psychological 
    effects around decision-making, such as Risk bias, Negativity bias and 
    Confirmation bias<sup>15</sup>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
    <p class="MsoListBullet">Interpersonal psychological effects of 
    working in groups, including groupthink<sup>26</sup>, risky shift<sup>15</sup> 
    and leader dependency<sup>27</sup>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
    <p class="MsoListBullet">Effects of personality type, such as Kirton&#8217;s Adaptor-Innovator (KAI) 
    <sup>28</sup>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
    <p class="MsoListBullet">Internal modes of thinking that result both 
    in creative ideas and ways to carry these through to practical applications. 
    Creative people have been studied in depth and from various angles, and 
    their mental strategies are available for adoption from a number of authors<sup>29</sup>,
    <sup>30</sup>, <sup>31</sup>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
    <p class="MsoListBullet">The deeper cognitive effects of various 
    stimuli such as preinventive forms<sup>31</sup>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="MsoListBullet">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoListBullet">
      Does this mean we all need to become Ph.D&#8217;s in 
      psychology? Not really. Psychological principles have long been a part of 
      management training. All that is required is to direct and enhance this 
      education to include those factor which will act to increase the creative 
      ability and application within the organisation.</p>
    

    <h2><a name="lim"></a>Limitations of the maturity model</h2>
    <P>As W. Edwards Deming said, &#8220;All 
    models are wrong, but some are useful&#8221; Maturity is a useful model, but we 
    cannot simply push an organisation into a box marked &#8216;Level 2&#8217; without 
    recognising the limitations that this categorisation brings.</p>
    <P>&nbsp;</p>
    <P>The maturity of an organisation is 
    an aggregate of the maturity of its individual members. Skills and abilities 
    do not diffuse instantly across a company and individuals are known to 
    accept change at different rates<sup>33</sup>. Innovation diffuses according 
    to a number of factors34, such as social position and the ability 
    to understand new concepts. There is also more direct need for innovation in 
    functions such as R&amp;D than in some other areas, resulting in a natural 
    imbalance in the attention to creativity and innovation.</p>
    <P>&nbsp;</p>
    <P>As a result, there is a distribution 
    of innovation maturity across groups and organisations, and the numerical 
    &#8216;innovation maturity&#8217; of the organisation is an average. If the standard 
    deviation of that distribution is high, then a single numerical maturity 
    level is probably not a good measure of the company in question.</p>
    <P>&nbsp;</p>
    <P>Nevertheless, the model is a useful 
    paradigm for understanding parts of the organisation and identifying actions 
    required to transform individual entities to the required level of 
    innovative ability.</p>
    <h2>Directions for future research</h2>
    <P>The maturity model of innovation is 
    proposed as a conceptual framework, with a goal of helping to identify 
    actual innovation style and to guide future activity in this area. How 
    useful this is in practice will only come through active experimentation and 
    research.</p>
    <P>&nbsp;</p>
    <P>The effects of different 
    distributions of innovation maturity distribution in organisations and 
    groups are probably little understood and there may be some merit in 
    investigating this area.</p>
    <P>&nbsp;</p>
    <P>Perhaps the most intractable area 
    for many organisations is in the more general management of change, that is, 
    the transitions between the maturity levels. In the academic field we 
    often skip straight to the &#8216;understanding&#8217; level, but people organisations 
    are not (perhaps by definition), that clever. This also raises the question 
    of whether organisations have to go through each level, and if they 
    do not, how the transition process differs.</p>
    <P>&nbsp;</p>
    <P>Methods for measuring innovative 
    tendencies and abilities have been well researched<sup>28</sup>, <sup>35</sup> and 
    there is probably little requirement for further investigation, although one 
    or more of these instruments may be used in the above research.</p>
