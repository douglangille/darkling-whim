<h1>TRIZ 40 Principles</h1>

<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="../../tools.htm">Creative tools</a> &gt;
<a href="../triz_contradiction_analysis.htm">TRIZ Contradiction Analysis</a> &gt; 
Principles</p>
<p class="smaller" align="center">&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>1. Segmentation</h2>

      <p>Segmentation means to separate into smaller parts. A modular design can 
      result in parts which plug together in different ways, or is easy to 
      manufacture, assemble and take apart, such as when repairing or 
      transporting it. Open office 'cubicles' use segmentation to allow the 
      layout of offices to be easily changed. As you now have separate parts you 
      can treat these parts differently or they can be made of different 
      materials and have different shapes.</p>

      <h2>2. Extraction</h2>

      <p>Extraction means to take out or separate something, such as removing a 
      painful tooth or singling out the critical parts of a system. Sometimes 
      simply placing a bad art of the system in a different place lessens the 
      bad effect or removes it completely, as with our lamp post example. Seek 
      the value of different parts or aspects. Low-value items may be eliminated 
      or high-value items may be extracted and used elsewhere in different 
      circumstances. </p>

      <h2>3. Local Quality</h2>

      <p>Do not assume that the current placing or usage of parts cannot be 
      changed--the reasons may be buried in history or may be more for 
      manufacturing convenience than for the value they give in operation. Local 
      Quality means to single out specific parts and then to change them or 
      place them in an environment such that they are optimally useful.</p>

      <h2>4. Asymmetry</h2>

      <p>As aesthetic people, we are often attracted to symmetry, which leads us 
      to not question whether asymmetry may be more useful. Symmetrical objects 
      are often easier to manufacture, but may not be the most useful design. To 
      use asymmetry, make uniform objects asymmetrical; make things asymmetrical 
      in each of the different dimensions of the object and for more than one 
      parameter. Fashion designers use asymmetry to create a wide range of 
      interesting styles. Varying shapes give the opportunity for one shape to 
      do one thing and another shape to perform another function.</p>

      <h2>5. Combination</h2>

      <p>The principle of combination is bring together things which happen at 
      the same time or in the same place. This can mean doing things in parallel 
      or creating single devices where previously there were more. A washing 
      machine that also acts as a tumble-drier uses the principle of 
      combination. Combination gives you the opportunity to simplify!</p>

      <h2>6. Universality</h2>

      <p>Universality is used where objects can perform multiple functions, such 
      as 'Swiss army' knives or sofa beds. It is particularly useful where you 
      can eliminate an object by having another object perform the same 
      function.</p>

      <h2>7. Nesting</h2>

      <p>Nesting means putting one thing inside another like a Russian doll, or 
      fitting things together in some way. An object which is contained within 
      another object is protected and makes the overall device smaller. The 
      telescope uses nesting both for focusing and to fold it up into a smaller 
      and more portable device.</p>

      <h2>8. Counterweight</h2>

      <p>When a system results in an undesirable force in one direction, a 
      counterweight is a deliberate change to balance out or improve the 
      situation by acting in the opposite direction. Traction control systems in 
      vehicles can change the suspension system to shift the positioning of the 
      body to balance out a tendency to roll.</p>

      <h2>9. Prior Counteraction</h2>

      <p>When you know that an undesirable situation is going to happen, you may 
      be able to do something ahead of when it would occur, either to prevent it 
      from happening or to reduce the impact that might be felt when it does 
      happen. Methods to do this includes reinforcing and setting up 
      counterweights so the problem is managed at all times.</p>

      <h2>10. Prior Action</h2>

      <p>When something is to be done at some time, Prior Action means preparing 
      or taking some action beforehand to smooth and ease the event when it does 
      occur. For example, laying the table for breakfast last thing in the 
      evening will save time and stress on the following morning in the sleepy 
      hurry to eat and get to work. It is far too easy to design a device or 
      manufacturing process so that something is done when it is needed to be 
      done. But that may not be the best time for it to happen so think about 
      when you want an action/function and choose the best time!</p>

      <h2>11. Cushion in Advance</h2>

      <p>Another form of doing things ahead of an event is to prepare for things 
      which will fail or go wrong in some way. This can range from 
      mistake-proofing a process to creating uninterruptable power supplies for 
      computers.</p>

      <h2>12. Equipotentiality</h2>

      <p>A lot of work involves lifting and lowering things, for example to 
      access parts underneath them. Equipotentiality means finding ways to avoid 
      this heavy work. For example, a chest of drawers was a simple solution to 
      the problems of a single chest, where to get to things at the bottom you 
      had to take out all of the things on top (and then put them back again).</p>

      <h2>13. Inversion</h2>

      <p>Inversion means doing the opposite of what might seem normal, such as 
      having a tray come out of a hi-fi system to accept a CD, rather than 
      having to insert the CD into a static part of the system. You can lift 
      instead of lower, do things in reverse order, turn things upside down and 
      a thousand other inverting actions.</p>

      <h2>14. Spheroidality</h2>

      <p>We tend to like flat surfaces and often do not challenge them. 
      Spheroidality asks us to consider curves, in all of their various forms. 
      We can use ball bearings to reduce friction, bend metal smoothly to retain 
      strength or move things around in smooth curves rather than angular jerks. 
      Where there already is curvature, change the radius, or let a flat curve 
      take off into another dimension.</p>

      <h2>15. Dynamicity</h2>

      <p>If a system is made up of parts which are all connected rigidly 
      together, then any force applied to the system is felt equally by all 
      parts. When things are fixed, then when their environment changes, they 
      are unable to cope well with the change. Dynamicity means creating systems 
      which are able to cope with change and intrusions from outside it. 
      Separating parts, using suspension systems, flexible connections and 
      cushioning all are methods of achieving dynamicity.</p>

      <h2>16. Partial, overdone or excessive action</h2>

      <p>Sometimes perfection is either impossible or too expensive to consider. 
      What you can always consider is how you can do things at less than or even 
      more than 100%, and to what degree you can do this. Animals cope with 
      varying food supplies by storing food that is not needed now as body fat 
      (which can also double up as insulation) or slowing down their metabolic 
      rate, such as by hibernating or sleeping.</p>

      <h2>17. Moving to a new dimension</h2>

      <p>When you are having problems that has to do with straight lines, try 
      using a second or third dimension. Go upwards, sideways or around corners. 
      Reflect energy, bend metal, change your route. You can also move 
      dimensions by rotating the object, changing your viewpoint, or even 
      changing the number of objects.</p>

      <h2>18. Mechanical vibration</h2>

      <p>Vibration is effectively a way of injecting energy into an object, 
      which can break it away from other things or allow it to be moved 
      ('bounced') easily. You can do this by shaking, vibrating, sound waves or 
      ultrasonics. By varying both the frequency and amplitude, you can create 
      different effects.</p>

      <h2>19. Periodic action</h2>

      <p>A vibration is a constant series of energy bursts. We can also put gaps 
      between those energy bursts to create Periodic action. If you are using 
      continuous force, pulsed energy can be more effective (this is what a 
      hammer drill does). You can change the force, how long it is applied and 
      how long between each application. Rear cycle lamps were once all 
      constantly red, then someone came up with the idea of a flashing light 
      which not only saves energy, it also attracts motorists' attention.</p>

      <h2>20. Continuity of useful action</h2>

      <p>Not all parts of all machines are being optimally used all of the time. 
      We can thus improve matters by reducing this idle time or putting it to 
      better use. For example a reciprocating saw has a dead time at the end of 
      each stroke which is eliminated by the circular saw. An alternative may be 
      to put the reciprocation to good use, such as actuating a pump which 
      removes the sawdust.</p>

      <h2>21. Rushing through</h2>

      <p>Doing things at high speed reduces the time during which problems may 
      occur. For example, if you are cutting a soft material slowly, it will 
      deform, making the cutting a difficult job. By doing it very fast, the 
      material does not have time to deform.</p>

      <h2>22. Convert harm into benefit</h2>

      <p>Sometimes harmful or undesired effects, such as the creation of waste, 
      result from the process. A simple conversion of harm to benefit is when 
      the heat from a vehicle engine is used to warm the people in the car. Many 
      industries born from inventively looking at how waste can be not only 
      recycled but also put to good use. If something does not work well, ask 
      'where else would this limited effect be useful?' You can even increase 
      the harm to create benefit, such as making enough flammable waste gasses 
      to heat the building.</p>

      <h2>23. Feedback</h2>

      <p>Feedback is taking or sensing the output of a system and using this to 
      change events which happen before, such as a thermostat being used to 
      control temperature. You can also reverse feedback, perhaps to exaggerate 
      or accelerate change or to cancel out an undesirable effect. Pop stars use 
      positive feedback to create howling guitar noises. People who like silence 
      can use noise cancelling feedback.</p>

      <h2>24. Mediator</h2>

      <p>Sometimes you need an action carried out which cannot easily be done by 
      the system as it is. In this case, you have the option of either adding a 
      new part or temporarily bringing in something to perform the action. To 
      remove liquid from a vessel, you can build in a tipping mechanism or bring 
      in a pump when it is needed.</p>

      <h2>25. Self-service</h2>

      <p>Can your device do things for itself, even occasional actions such as 
      testing or maintenance? To create a hole into which a tube must fit very 
      snugly, you might be able to get the tube to drill the hole itself by 
      heating or sharpening the end, perhaps in combination with another 
      principle such as vibration.</p>

      <h2>26. Copying</h2>

      <p>Rather than use the expensive, delicate or inaccessible original, can 
      you use a simple copy. This may be done physically or optically, such as 
      using an image of some sort. Once you have a copy, you can change it 
      different ways to achieve the desired benefit. Image intensifiers work by 
      taking a copy of the light available and amplifying it. It may, for 
      example, be easier to measure a copy of an object than the object itself.</p>

      <h2>27. Inexpensive short life</h2>

      <p>When something is relatively expensive or causes other problems, you 
      might be able to replace it with something cheaper that works for the 
      moment. This is a principle than has been used many times to create a 
      disposable society. From Gillette&#8217;s razor blades onwards, many inventors 
      have found that a lucrative income can be created with cheap devices that 
      people buy regularly.</p>

      <h2>28. Replacement of a mechanical system</h2>

      <p>Mechanical inventors sometimes get trapped by their discipline and 
      opportunities arise for those with knowledge of other subjects can improve 
      the system. You can even replace physical systems with invisible effects, 
      for example replacing wheels on a train by a magnetic lift system. You can 
      also create different effects by varying fields such as using high 
      frequencies or pulsing.</p>

      <h2>29. Use pneumatic or hydraulic systems</h2>

      <p>In its most general form, this principle is about replacing solids with 
      liquids or gases, which can easily be channelled and have different 
      properties such as their flexibility, which can be useful for cushioning. 
      Pneumatic and hydraulic systems are particularly useful for channelling 
      energy to a desired place, using flexible pipes. By changing the bore of 
      the pipe, pressure can also be easily increased or decreased.</p>

      <h2>30. Flexible film or thin membranes</h2>

      <p>Thin films have a number of useful properties, such as low cost, low 
      space, flexibility and usage. They can be used to separate, isolate and 
      protect, such as the &#8216;cling film&#8217; that is used to wrap food. The film can 
      be bought in a roll, but it can also be created in situ (paint is just 
      such a useful thin film).</p>

      <h2>31. Use of porous materials</h2>

      <p>Porous material allow some substances through them and block others, 
      which allows them to be used for separating and filtering out desired or 
      undesirable elements. As with mops, they also can be used for absorbing 
      and collecting liquids or gases, which can subsequently be released in a 
      controlled manner as required. Where porosity is an undesirable effect, 
      then you may want to clog up the pores rather than utilise them.</p>

      <h2>32. Changing the colour</h2>

      <p>Colour can be an aesthetic factor or it can have practical uses, such 
      as signalling danger. It can also be used as a detection mechanism, such 
      as the use of litmus paper to determine acidity levels. You can also 
      change the transparency of colours, such as in optical filters.</p>

      <h2>33. Homogeneity</h2>

      <p>A homogeneous substance is made up of the same material. So what if you 
      made your device out of different materials? What would be the effect of 
      each part? How would these interact? What if you used all the same 
      material? The principle of homogeneity can also be used in other areas, 
      such as the behaviour of parts of the system. In an electronic system all 
      plugs could be the same to reduce costs, or they could be different to 
      prevent accidentally plugging things into the wrong place.</p>

      <h2>34. Rejecting and regenerating parts</h2>

      <p>When a part has been used and is no longer needed, what do you do with 
      it? Typically you either throw it away, restore it or recycle it somehow. 
      Whichever approach you use, you will probably need to include some system 
      to cope with this.</p>

      <h2>35. Transforming physical or chemical states</h2>

      <p>Sometimes changing the object in some way, such as its temperature, 
      concentration or density, is useful. Think of the chemical composition of 
      the substances. What is the relationship between the atoms and molecules? 
      Are they tightly bound together, do they slide around or come apart 
      easily? Look at the effects on flexibility, load-bearing, chemical 
      reactions, and so on.</p>

      <h2>36. Phase transition</h2>

      <p>Substances often go through changes, such as expanding, evaporating, 
      cooling or changing shape. Think about how this happens and how you can 
      start, stop or otherwise control the change. Is the effect reversible? Can 
      you use a simple catalytic effect?</p>

      <h2>37. Thermal expansion</h2>

      <p>When you heat things up, they usually expand at varying rates. This can 
      either be a problem that you need to handle or it can be a tool to solve 
      problems. The bimetallic strip is a simple example where two connected 
      metal strips, each of which expands at a different rate, resulting in a 
      device which bends when it is heated, thus giving the basis of many 
      thermostats and thermometers.</p>

      <h2>38. Use strong oxidisers</h2>

      <p>The oxygen in the air reacts with many substances, from iron (creating 
      rust) to flammable substances (enabling fire). This effect can be 
      increased by using materials which combine with oxygen more easily or by 
      adding more oxygen to the system, for example in a blowtorch.</p>

      <h2>39. Inert environment</h2>

      <p>When oxygen and other reagents in the environment are a problem, 
      sometimes a good solution is to take them away, replacing them with 
      chemicals that will not react with your device. For example, light bulbs 
      are partially evacuated and filled with inert gases to prevent the thin 
      filament from oxidising and thus breaking.</p>

      <h2>40. Composite materials</h2>

      <p>When things are made of all the same substance, they are vulnerable to 
      problems that affect that material. By using a combination of materials, 
      synergistic effects can be created where the different materials used not 
      only contribute their different properties, they also act together to 
      provide something that is better than any individual part. For example, 
      composite bows can fire arrows further and more consistently than bows 
      made of any single material.</p>
