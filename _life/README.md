## Reference Archive Guidelines

The changingminds.org and creatingminds.org archives are **frozen, read-only reference material**. They serve as queryable knowledge bases but are not part of active PKM.

### Working with Archives

**Query, don't modify:** Use archives for research and reference but never edit the original HTML files.

**Extract when needed:** When archive content becomes relevant for active work, create a new note in the appropriate domain folder (`_writing` for storytelling craft, `_work` for persuasion/leadership, `_tech` for communication techniques, etc.).

**Link back:** Include provenance links to archive sources in your domain notes for reference.

**Organic growth:** Let your PKM develop naturally in domain folders where you're actively working. Archives remain a deep reference layer, not primary content.

This approach maintains clean separation between reference material and living knowledge while preserving the valuable archived content for consultation.
