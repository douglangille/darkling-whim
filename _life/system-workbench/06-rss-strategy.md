# RSS Strategy

## Mental Model

- **feeeed** = newspaper (real-time, in-the-moment)
- **Inoreader** = research library (archive, long-tail reference)

## feeeed (Mobile)

### Purpose
- Daily skim
- Recency-focused
- Frictionless, neurodivergent-friendly flow

### Configuration
- ~30 feeds (kept light)
- Rotated seasonally
- Unread counts disabled
- Mobile-primary interface

### Feed Categories
- News
- Work (higher ed, AI, tech, productivity)

## Inoreader (Browser)

### Purpose
- Archive access
- Strategic research
- Tagging and retrieval
- Second-brain-style corpus

### Usage Pattern
- **Not** a daily skim tool
- **Not** an inbox
- Tag, archive, and retrieve as needed
- Full back catalog access

### Folder Structure
- **Signal**: Trusted thinkers
- **Noise**: Exploratory content

## Segmentation Strategy

**By intent, not topic**:
- Daily skim → feeeed
- Longtail reference → Inoreader

## Framework Sources

- Monthly Method → RSS feed (no website bookmark needed)
- Agile Results → RSS feed
- Maggie Appleton's digital garden → RSS (slow-drip insight)

## Decision Rules

- Delete bookmarks for frameworks tracked via RSS
- Use bookmarks only for frequently accessed tools
- Use Apple Notes Reference Vault for individual posts/insights (not entire sites)
- Track sites via RSS for ambient awareness (no browser bookmarks)

## Open Loops

- Potential Inoreader tagging schema by narrative function:
  - Signal
  - Inspiration
  - Strategic Fuel
- Optional automation: sync starred Inoreader items → Apple Notes or Forever Notes (IFTTT/Zapier)
- Optional seasonal review plan to rotate/archive feeeed feeds

## Discardables

- Temptation to use Inoreader as daily skim (counterproductive)
- False need to "keep up with everything" (reframed as scene-based, not saga-based productivity)
- Illusion of "keeping up"
