# AI Literacy & CLEAR Framework

## Source

EDUCAUSE Shop Talk episode: "A Practical Guide to AI Literacy" (August 11, 2025)

## Key Takeaways

- Multiple faculty entry points
- Start small, iterate
- Use practical frameworks for AI literacy in higher ed

## CLEAR Framework (AI Prompting)

### Context Scope

Scoped specifically to **AI prompting** (not coaching frameworks, not goal-setting variants).

### Definition

- **C**oncise
- **L**ogical
- **E**xplicit
- **A**daptive
- **R**eflective

### Elements Explained

#### Concise
- Clear, direct prompts
- No unnecessary complexity
- Focused on essential information

#### Logical
- Structured reasoning
- Sequential thinking
- Coherent flow

#### Explicit
- Specific requirements stated
- Clear expectations
- Unambiguous language

#### Adaptive
- Adjust based on response
- Iterative refinement
- Context-aware modifications

#### Reflective
- Review and assess outputs
- Learn from results
- Continuous improvement

## Application to Higher Ed

### Target Audiences
- Faculty
- Librarians
- IT staff

### Implementation Approach

**Tiered Faculty Engagement**:
- Entry points
- Examples
- Quick wins
- Potential library-led supports

## Open Loops

- Create one-page CLEAR prompt-checklist handout for faculty/librarians/IT
- Compare CLEAR against other prompt frameworks and AI-literacy rubrics
- Recommend default framework for NSCC
- Map CLEAR to tiered faculty engagement with examples

## Discardables

- Non-article CLEAR variants (InsideTrack coaching; CLEAR goals) unless context reopens
- Generic AI-literacy rhetoric without actionable frameworks
