**User:**

Given how I use chatgpt (and other AI tools), is this an honest and transparent disclaimer as to how I use the tools? 

AI Assistance Disclaimer
This document was developed with the support of artificial intelligence tools for tasks such as brainstorming, research verification, accessibility checks, and language refinement. All content has been reviewed and approved by the author to ensure accuracy and appropriateness.

---

**Assistant:**

One line: it’s close, but it sounds more corporate than accurate for how you actually work.  

**Analysis**
- It frames usage as light-touch (“support”) when you often use AI as a structured thinking partner, editor, and generator that you then refine.  
- “Research verification” is risky wording because AI isn’t a verification tool.  
- “Accessibility checks” may overpromise unless you’re explicitly running those checks.  
- “Reviewed and approved” is fine, but it reads like legalese.

**Fixes**
- Be explicit that the tools help with ideation, drafting, and clarity.  
- Avoid implying AI fact-checks.  
- Keep it short and human.

**Sample Rewrite (clean + honest)**
> This document was created with help from AI tools for outlining, drafting, and improving clarity. The author reviewed and adjusted all content to ensure it reflects their intent and meets accuracy standards.

If you want something even plainer, I can tune it.

---

**User:**

What's a plainer and honest version 

---

**Assistant:**

Here’s a straightforward, no-nonsense version:

> I used AI tools to help outline and draft this document. I reviewed and edited everything, and the final content is my own.

If you want it to sound slightly more formal or more casual, I can adjust.

---

**User:**

How about something more present tense

---

**Assistant:**

Try this:

> I use AI tools to help outline and draft my work, and I review and edit everything before it’s final.

If you want it even shorter: *“I use AI to help draft my work, and I review all content myself.”*

---

**User:**

What would be a work appropriate version?

---

**Assistant:**

Here are two work-appropriate options—neutral, clear, and non-technical.

**Option A (standard professional):**  
> I use AI tools to support outlining and drafting. All content is reviewed and finalized by me.

**Option B (a bit more formal):**  
> AI tools are used to assist with outlining and drafting. All material is reviewed and approved by the author before publication.

If you want it to sound more policy-friendly, I can tune further.

---

**User:**

My activities included research, ideation, outlining and drafrting

---

**User:**

My activities included research, ideation, outlining and drafrting

---

**Assistant:**

Here are a few polished, work-appropriate versions that reflect those activities cleanly.

**Option A (straightforward, professional):**  
> I use AI tools to support research, ideation, outlining, and drafting. All content is reviewed and finalized by me.

**Option B (slightly more formal):**  
> AI tools are used to assist with research, ideation, outlining, and drafting. All material is reviewed and approved by the author before publication.

**Option C (minimalist):**  
> I use AI to assist with research, ideation, outlining, and drafting, and I review all final content.

Want it more conversational or more formal?

---

**User:**

Brainstorming or ideation?

---

**Assistant:**

“Brainstorming” is clearer and more widely understood in workplace contexts; “ideation” skews consultant-speak.  

Use **brainstorming** unless the audience expects design-thinking language.

---

**User:**

Ok.. do that

---

**Assistant:**

Here’s the clean, work-appropriate version using **brainstorming**:

> I use AI tools to support research, brainstorming, outlining, and drafting. All content is reviewed and finalized by me.

If you need shorter or more formal, just say the word.

---

**User:**

Is outlining needed?

---

**Assistant:**

Short answer: not really. “Drafting” already implies some level of structural work, and most readers won’t care about the distinction.

A cleaner version without it:

> I use AI tools to support research, brainstorming, and drafting. All content is reviewed and finalized by me.

If you *want* to signal structure/organization help without the extra word, we can tweak, but this is lean and accurate.

---

**User:**

Does research, brainstorming and drafting accurately reflect how I use chatgpt?

---

**Assistant:**

Short version: **yes, mostly — but “research” needs care.**

**Breakdown**
- **Brainstorming** — absolutely. You use it heavily as a thinking partner and option generator.
- **Drafting** — yes. You co-draft scenes, prompts, explanations, workflows, and policy-ish text.
- **Research** — *partially.* You don’t use it to *verify* facts; you use it to *survey*, *frame*, and *synthesize*. If someone reads “research” as “fact-checked by AI,” that’s inaccurate.

**If you keep “research,” consider softening it:**  
- “…to support research tasks”  
- “…to explore ideas during research”  
- “…to assist with research and synthesis”

**Most accurate phrasing:**  
> I use AI tools to support research tasks, brainstorming, and drafting. All content is reviewed and finalized by me.

If you want it even tighter, I can tune it.

---

**User:**

I like the idea of using "support"... that is "to support research, brainstorming, and drafting"

---

**Assistant:**

Here’s the polished version built around that phrasing:

> I use AI tools to support research, brainstorming, and drafting. All content is reviewed and finalized by me.

It’s clear, accurate, and workplace-safe.

---

**User:**

Formal or neutral version?

---

**Assistant:**

Here are both so you can pick the tone that fits the audience:

**Neutral (work-appropriate, plain):**  
> I use AI tools to support research, brainstorming, and drafting. All content is reviewed and finalized by me.

**Formal (policy/report style):**  
> AI tools are used to support research, brainstorming, and drafting. All material is reviewed and approved by the author prior to finalization.

If you tell me the setting (report, proposal, academic, policy), I can tune further.

---

**User:**

Formal should be in the past tense as a disclaimer of use.. the neutral is fine in first person present tense and might land well as an email signature

---

**Assistant:**

Here are the two versions tuned accordingly:

**Neutral (first-person, present tense — good for signatures):**  
> I use AI tools to support research, brainstorming, and drafting. All content is reviewed and finalized by me.

**Formal (past-tense disclaimer):**  
> AI tools were used to support research, brainstorming, and drafting. All material was reviewed and approved by the author prior to finalization.

If you need a variant for a specific document type, I can adjust.
