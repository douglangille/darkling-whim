**User:**

So the plan is to use Apple Notes for quarterly and weekly planning, tagged notes for quick reference stuff that belongs on Apple notes, and untagged items that would represent an Inbox to sort through. 

Obsidian is my writing workbench and my knowledge archive of notes, ideas, and source docs of my own creation. Eg my resume. As currently conceived, it isn’t for copy/paste text from websites, etc. If I save it, it’s because I wrote my own thoughts (with or without an LLM). Probably keep all LLM related material here. Eg prompt library. 

My default document folder points to my personal OneDrive and contains a couple gigs of documents and files that I probably haven’t opened in years. The idea would be to set aside some time and move anything I’ve written into Obsidian and maybe some quick reference stuff into Apple Notes. I’ll delete a bunch of stuff. There will be other detritus that can’t be deleted. .. should I actively put pdfs or appliance warranties and stuff like that into Apple notes or Obsidian? Or leave it in OneDrive? The goal that I have in mind is in consolidating my storage. Opinions?

---

**Assistant:**

You’re basically circling three buckets already—Notes for “operational now,” Obsidian for “thinking and writing,” OneDrive for “static files”—and the only real question is how aggressive you want to be about collapsing that third one.

**Short take:** keep PDFs, warranties, and anything you didn’t author in OneDrive; don’t pollute Notes or Obsidian with inert files. Let each system do what it’s actually good at.

Here’s the more textured pass.

---

## Quick assessment
You’ve already defined the most important distinction:  
**Notes = lightweight planning + scratchpad + tagged quick-ref**  
**Obsidian = authored thinking + LLM workbench + durable knowledge**  
**OneDrive = every file that should exist but nobody wants to look at.**

That’s a clean split. The only tension is the dream of “consolidation,” which sounds tidy but often becomes a disguised version of “shoving files somewhere they don’t belong.”

---

## What really matters for consolidation
Think in terms of *retrieval friction* vs *editing friction* vs *stability*:

- **Apple Notes**: amazing retrieval for *your own short, human-created snippets*. Awful for long-term file storage. No folder-level affordances; attachments get weird over time; exporting is a pain.
- **Obsidian**: superb for *ideas, writing, and text you want to iterate on*. Terrible as a file cabinet. PDFs in Obsidian will exist but won’t feel native or pleasant to manage.
- **OneDrive**: boring and stable. Perfect for things that must exist but rarely get touched.

So the real split is:  
**Do you want a “library” (Obsidian) or a “filing cabinet” (OneDrive)?**  
They are not the same service.

---

## Recommended boundaries

### 1. **Obsidian (authored + high-context)**
Lives here:
- Anything you wrote  
- Prompt libraries  
- Story bibles, ideas, captured reflections  
- Reference notes *you created* based on reading  
- Your resume, portfolio, job docs (since they’re authored and evolve)

Should *not* live here:
- Warranties  
- PDFs you didn’t write  
- Receipts  
- Downloaded manuals  
- Random “important” documents you don’t want to lose  
These are inert and clutter your idea space.

---

### 2. **Apple Notes (planning + quick ref)**
Lives here:
- Quarterly + weekly plans  
- Tagged cheat sheets you’ll use often  
- A few PDFs you reference *frequently* (like 2–3 max)  
- Screenshots you need for the next few days  
- Small bits of “I’ll need this soon and then delete it.”

Should *not* live here:
- Archives  
- Long-term storage  
- Your entire email-attachment graveyard  
Once you put files here, getting them out is a chore.

---

### 3. **OneDrive (cold storage + formal docs)**
Lives here:
- All PDFs, warranties, appliance manuals  
- Contracts, tax slips, etc  
- Anything that’s basically “digital paper”  
- All documents with legal/administrative meaning

This bucket should be boring and simple.  
It doesn’t need to be “consolidated” into the other apps because those apps just aren’t file repositories.

---

## Suggested cleanup workflow
A light, low-friction pass:

1. **Sort by “Did I write this?”**
   - Yes → Obsidian  
   - No → stays in OneDrive

2. **Sort by “Do I need to reference this in the next 1–7 days?”**
   - Yes → drop a copy in Notes (tagged or untagged as appropriate)  
   - No → stays in OneDrive

3. **Shred mercilessly** for anything truly obsolete.

4. **Don’t import PDF archives into Obsidian.**  
   If a PDF needs contextual notes, create a note in Obsidian *about* it, but leave the file itself in OneDrive and link to it.

---

## Why this works
You avoid polluting your creative space, you keep Notes light and tactical, and you stop OneDrive from feeling like a junk drawer because it becomes what it should’ve been the whole time: the place where the boring but essential stuff goes.

---

If you want, I can sketch the exact folder structure in OneDrive and a matching set of tags/folders in Notes and Obsidian so the whole ecosystem feels intentional.

---

**User:**

Sure. That would be a nice template. I’ll probably do my own thing based on your provided inspiration 

---

**Assistant:**

Here’s a clean template you can adapt for your storage-and-workflow decisions without locking you in.

**One sentence:** The simplest rule is: keep *active* and *personally-authored* material close (Notes/Obsidian), and let OneDrive hold the long-tail detritus unless there’s a real retrieval need.

---

## Storage Decision Template (Opinionated, Minimal)

### 1. Apple Notes → “Active, Lightweight, Quick”
Use it for:
- **Quarterly / weekly planning**
- **Checklists + quick reference** (e.g., router password, appliance model numbers)
- **Captured snippets** you *intend to process soon*
- **PDFs** only if:  
  - You reference them regularly **and**  
  - They’re easier to find if attached to a note (e.g., *“Heat pump: model + warranty summary”*)

Avoid putting here:
- Anything archival or rarely used.
- Anything requiring structure or cross-linking.

Mental model: *Short-term memory + quick lookup drawer.*

---

### 2. Obsidian → “Workbench + Personal Knowledge Base”
Use it for:
- Anything **you wrote**, including:
  - Essays, reflections, project docs
  - Your **resume**, role descriptions, career strategy notes
  - Prompt library & LLM interactions worth keeping
  - Story bible, writing drafts, experiments
- Long-lived **“what I know”** notes (not “what I downloaded”)

Avoid putting here:
- Manuals, warranties, externally authored PDFs (unless you’re **actively annotating** them or writing attached commentary)
- Anything with no thought added — this keeps the vault clean and confidence high.

Mental model: *Your brain’s extended memory.*

---

### 3. OneDrive → “Cold Storage, Low-Maintenance”
Use it for:
- **PDFs you don’t read often**: appliance manuals, tax slips, health/dental statements
- **Receipts**, statements, old coursework, miscellaneous junk
- Things you don’t want to delete but also don’t want cluttering higher-friction systems
- Bulk archives (e.g., “old writing from 2014” that you may someday mine)

Avoid putting here:
- Anything you expect to access weekly or monthly.
- Workflow actions; this is storage, not work.

Mental model: *Deep freeze.*

---

## Decision Heuristics (Fast)
Ask:

- **Do I need my own thoughts attached to it?**  
  → Obsidian  
- **Do I need to access this during a normal week?**  
  → Notes  
- **Do I mostly need it to exist somewhere, but I don’t care where?**  
  → OneDrive  
- **Is it a PDF I’ll barely look at except when something breaks?**  
  → OneDrive, not Notes  
- **Is it a PDF I reference a few times per year?**  
  → Notes, but summarize it (don’t dump 80 pages)

---

## Folder Pass Template (When You Clean OneDrive)
**Pass 1: Trash**  
Obvious junk.

**Pass 2: Move to Obsidian**  
Only files that represent *your own authored work* or require active thinking.

**Pass 3: Move to Apple Notes**  
Short, high-utility reference items you’ll actually use.

**Pass 4: Everything Else → Stay in OneDrive**  
Cold storage wins.

---

## Quick Examples
- **Washer warranty PDF** → OneDrive  
- **Washer maintenance checklist you wrote** → Notes  
- **Notes on whether you should replace the washer next year** → Obsidian  
- **Career narrative draft** → Obsidian  
- **Recipe you reference weekly** → Notes  
- **Random downloaded article** → Delete or OneDrive (unless you created notes from it → Obsidian)

---

If you want, I can turn this into a single-page Apple Note or Obsidian template.

---

**User:**

Ok. Makes sense. I need to go through my chatbots and clean up the conversation history. While it isn’t technically hurting nothing, it’s mental weight that content is living there. The fold probably goes to obsidian. Most should be deleted or archived to signal it’s been processed. Doesn’t matter which?

Is there a great omnibus prompt that I can use to rollup and summarize a long conversation without scrolling through and picking out individual outputs?

---

**Assistant:**

Here’s the one-liner you want: a single “drop it in and let the model do the heavy lifting” prompt you can paste into any chat to auto-roll-up an entire conversation without scrolling.

**Quick answer:** yes, the “processed → archive or delete” distinction doesn’t matter; choose whatever reduces cognitive drag. If the chat is feeding Obsidian, send only the *distilled* version, not the raw transcript.

---

## Omnibus Roll-Up Prompt (General-Purpose)

**One sentence:** Use this when you want a clean executive summary, thematic analysis, decisions, and action items from a long conversation.

**Omnibus Conversation Roll-Up Prompt**
```
You are my summarization engine.

Analyze our entire conversation up to this point — every message above — without requiring me to individually supply or scroll through anything.

Produce:
1. A concise executive summary (5–8 bullets).
2. Key decisions, conclusions, or outputs.
3. Outstanding questions or unresolved threads.
4. Action items (group by “Do”, “Capture”, “Maybe/Later”).
5. A compact knowledge extract suitable for storing in my Obsidian vault (clean, self-contained, no references to the chat).

If redundancy or contradictions appear in the conversation, reconcile them cleanly and choose the strongest interpretation. 
Strip out all filler, emotions, and conversational fluff. Just the distilled signal.
```

---

## Optional “Deep Roll-Up” Variant
If you want the model to act more like a forensic analyst:

```
Perform a deep roll-up of our entire conversation above. 
Identify the main themes, sub-themes, decision points, reasoning patterns, and any implicit assumptions I made. 
Merge duplicates, correct inconsistencies, and compress the material into a single coherent narrative + structured notes. 
Supply:
- Narrative roll-up (1–2 paragraphs)
- Structured notes (topics + distilled insights)
- Decisions made
- Next steps
- Archive-worthy artifacts (anything worth preserving in Obsidian)

Do not quote the chat. Rewrite everything cleanly.
```

---

## When to Use Which
- **Shorter chats:** use the first one.
- **Multi-session messy chats:** use the deep variant.
- **Exporting to Obsidian:** run either prompt, then copy only the “knowledge extract” or “archive-worthy artifacts.”

---

If you want, I can also draft:  
- a “chat cleanup protocol”  
- an Obsidian template for storing chat roll-ups  
- a workflow for periodically harvesting LLM work into your vault.

---

**User:**

Depending on the topic, these rollup could go to the daily note or individual notes. Probably the latter if I’m taking the time to summarize. 

---

**Assistant:**

Here’s the short answer up front: **yes — you can use one prompt to ingest an entire conversation and produce a clean roll-up without manually hunting for outputs.**

Below is a template built for your workflow (Apple Notes + Obsidian + “processed = archived/deleted”). It’s built to handle *any* long thread you paste in.

---

## **Omnibus Roll-Up Prompt (Drop-In Template)**

Use this whenever you paste a big conversation blob.

```
You are my conversation archivist.

TASK
1. Read the entire pasted conversation.
2. Extract only the meaningful content: decisions, insights, workflows, templates, writing guidance, technical steps, pros/cons, and anything that moves a project forward.
3. Ignore chit-chat, apologies, setup messages, repeated drafts, and side-paths unless they contain an insight.
4. Produce a clean roll-up in the following sections:

- **Summary (5–10 sentences):** What this conversation *was about* in plain language.  
- **Key Decisions & Conclusions:** Bulleted.  
- **Action Items / Next Steps:** Bulleted, explicit, minimal.  
- **Reusable Assets:** Templates, prompts, scripts, rules, definitions worth keeping.  
- **Reference Notes:** Any context I may want to file into Obsidian.

5. Apply compression and merge duplicates. Remove fluff.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Use tight, direct prose. No motivational tone. No meta-commentary on the prompt.

Ready. Paste the conversation.
```

---

## **How to Use It**
- **Daily note:** Paste the roll-up if the conversation relates to today’s work.  
- **Dedicated note:** Use when the topic is stable (workflow, concept, prompt library, writing guide).  
- **Chat cleanup:** Once summarized → archive/delete the thread guilt-free.

---

## **A Tiny Optimization (Optional)**
If you want the archivist to **tag** items that belong in Obsidian vs Apple Notes, add this block:

```
After the roll-up, add:
**Filing Suggestions:**  
- What belongs in Obsidian (knowledge, workflows, personal source material).  
- What belongs in Apple Notes (quick ref, reminders, temporary scraps).  
Keep this section short and decisive.
```

---

If you want, I can also build you a **variant** for:
- fiction-mode material  
- technical how-to conversations  
- project retros  

Need one?

---

**User:**

Nah. Just the two variants you first gave will do the trick I think: short focused convos and spraining multi-session/topic chats. 

---

**Assistant:**

Here are the two clean, reusable variants—tight, purpose-built, and ready to paste into whatever chatbot you’re cleaning up.

---

## **1) Short, single-topic conversation rollup**

**One-Prompt Rollup (Short Chats)**  
> *“Summarize this entire conversation into a tight, structured rollup intended for my Personal Knowledge Base. Preserve only the durable insights, decisions, and actionable outcomes. Remove filler, chit-chat, and ephemeral details.  
>  
> Output sections:  
> - **Core Insight** (1–3 sentences)  
> - **Decisions Made**  
> - **Key Reasoning / Rationale**  
> - **Next Steps**  
>  
> Keep it concise and neutral.”*

Use when: You had one focused chat and just want the useful residue.

---

## **2) Sprawling or multi-session conversation consolidation**

**Omnibus Rollup (Messy / Multi-Topic / Multi-Session)**  
> *“Create a unified, de-duplicated rollup of the **entire conversation history** in this thread, regardless of length.  
>  
> First, detect the natural topic clusters.  
> Then produce a structured summary with sections for each cluster:  
> - **Topic Summary**  
> - **Key Points & Insights**  
> - **Decisions / Commitments**  
> - **Open Questions**  
> - **Recommended Follow-ups**  
>  
> Strip out repetition, meta chatter, and transient side-paths. Collapse everything into clean, reusable knowledge suitable for long-term storage.”*

Use when: You’ve gone down rabbit holes, mixed topics, or had multiple days of discussion in one chat.

---

If you want, I can bundle these as a one-page “Chat Cleanup Kit” for Obsidian.

---

**User:**

Give me these two prompts in code blocks

---

**Assistant:**

Here are the two ready-to-paste prompts.

### **1) Short, focused conversations**
```md
You are my summarizer. Produce a tight, actionable roll-up of this single, focused conversation.

Instructions:
- Extract the core question/problem, the key insights, and the final decisions.
- Remove filler, pleasantries, and side-tracks.
- Convert any advice into a clear checklist of actions or rules.
- Keep it concise; no more than 6–10 bullets unless complexity demands more.
- Flag any open loops or follow-ups.

Here is the conversation:
<PASTE>
```

### **2) Sprawling, multi-session or multi-topic chats**
```md
You are my conversation compiler. Create a structured, high-level roll-up of this long, multi-topic chat history.

Instructions:
- Identify the major themes and subtopics; group content accordingly.
- For each theme: summarize decisions, insights, options explored, and unresolved questions.
- De-duplicate repeated threads; keep only the strongest version of the idea.
- Preserve chronology only where it affects meaning; otherwise, reorganize for clarity.
- Produce a final “Action/Reference Package” with:
  - Key decisions made
  - Guidance/rules extracted from the discussion
  - Items to archive
  - Items needing next steps

Here is the conversation:
<PASTE>
```

---

**User:**

I’d probably use these as the last question before I archive. 

However, for chats that might be longer than the context window, probably better to export and attach as a document maybe?

---

**Assistant:**

Here are the two variants, clean and ready to paste.

### **1. Short, focused conversations**
```text
<ChatMerge>
Please produce a concise, high-signal rollup of this conversation. 
Focus on: (1) the core question/problem, (2) the key reasoning steps, 
(3) the final answer or decision, and (4) any follow-ups I should consider.

Strip fluff, restate only what materially matters, and phrase it as a standalone note.
</ChatMerge>
```

### **2. Sprawling, multi-session / multi-topic threads**
```text
<ChatMerge>
Please create a structured rollup of this full conversation (including prior sessions if available). 
Identify the major themes, decisions, unresolved questions, and reusable insights. 
Group related items, collapse repetition, and produce a self-contained overview 
that I can drop into my knowledge archive.

If there are contradictions or unclear threads, flag them.
</ChatMerge>
```

### On exported long chats  
Yes — if a conversation exceeds the context window, exporting and attaching as a file is the cleanest approach. I can ingest the whole thing in one go and produce a unified rollup without you having to scroll or clip segments manually.

Want a “long-chat export → summarize” template too?

---

**User:**

Sure. Note: I’m probably going to steer away from the whole chatmerge thing. Less useful if I’m extracting to obsidian on the reg. 

---

**Assistant:**

Here are clean, self-contained versions of the **two prompts**, each in its own code block, with no ChatMerge dependency.

---

## 1) **Short, focused conversations**
Use this when the chat is tight, single-topic, and you just want a clean takeaway.

```md
Please produce a concise end-of-conversation roll-up.

**What I need:**
- A clear summary of the key decisions, insights, and next steps.
- Strip out fluff, repetition, and speculative tangents.
- If there were options discussed, note the final choice and why.
- Keep it short but accurate.

**Purpose:** I’m about to archive this thread and want the essential output to save into my notes.
```

---

## 2) **Sprawling, multi-session or multi-topic conversations**
Use this when the chat is long, messy, or crossed multiple themes.

```md
Please generate a structured roll-up of this entire conversation.

**What to do:**
- Identify the major themes covered across the thread.
- For each theme: summarize the conclusions, decisions, recommended actions, and any open questions.
- Deduplicate recurring ideas so the final roll-up is clean and coherent.
- Flag anything that seems unresolved or worth capturing as its own note.

**Purpose:** I’m archiving this long thread and want a clean, durable summary I can store.
```

---

### On the “too long for the context window” issue
Yeah—if the conversation is massive, exporting it and attaching it as a document is the cleanest approach. Then you can ask for a structured roll-up of *that* file, which bypasses the chat history limit entirely.

Want me to draft an optimized “summarize this attached export” prompt too?

---

**User:**

Sure. 

---

**Assistant:**

Here are the **two prompt templates**, clean and ready to paste into your last message before archiving a chat.

---

## 1) **Short, focused conversation roll-up**
```md
Summarize this conversation into a concise, high-signal roll-up.

Format:
- What we decided
- Key reasoning
- Any open loops I should carry forward

Keep it short (150–250 words max) and strip out filler, meta-chat, and prompts.
```

---

## 2) **Sprawling, multi-session/topic conversation roll-up**
```md
Create a structured roll-up of this full conversation.

Format:
## 1. Core Topics
(Bullets, 3–7 items)

## 2. Decisions & Outputs
(What conclusions we reached; consolidate duplicates)

## 3. Useful Insights
(Only the ideas worth carrying forward)

## 4. Next Actions
(Clear, brief, action-ready)

Ignore all meta-chatter, dead ends, and prompt engineering steps. Deduplicate aggressively. Keep the output tight, analytical, and useful.
```

If you want, I can also draft a “use when exporting long chats as docs” version, but the above two should cover 95% of cases.

---

**User:**

Just had a brain fart. Maybe in this analysis, the prompt should make a suggestion on how useful the content is. That is, is it worth keeping at all or is it just hoarding? Score out of 100

---

**Assistant:**

Here are the two prompts—now updated to include a **“usefulness score (0–100)”** and a **keep/delete recommendation.**

---

## **1) Short, focused conversation roll-up prompt**
```md
You are my cleanup assistant.  
Summarize this single-topic conversation in a tight, actionable roll-up.

Return the following sections:

1. **Core Points** — the essential takeaways only.  
2. **Decisions & Commitments** — anything I decided, planned, or should remember.  
3. **Next Actions** — 1–3 concrete steps, if any.  
4. **Usefulness Score (0–100)** — how much long-term value this conversation has.  
5. **Keep or Delete?** — based on the score, recommend either “Keep (why)” or “Delete (why).”

Be concise, avoid filler, and surface only lasting value.
```

---

## **2) Sprawling, multi-session, multi-topic chat roll-up prompt**
```md
You are my consolidation assistant.  
This conversation is long, possibly multi-session, and may cover multiple themes.  
Extract only what has enduring value.

Return the following sections:

1. **Topic Map** — list the major themes or threads that appeared.  
2. **Distilled Insights** — the durable ideas worth keeping; skip any meandering.  
3. **Decisions & Influential Moments** — where my thinking shifted or solidified.  
4. **Reconstruct the Useful Stuff** — rewrite key outputs cleanly (no chat phrasing).  
5. **Next Actions / Follow-ups** — only if genuinely useful.  
6. **Usefulness Score (0–100)** — how retainable the whole chat is.  
7. **Keep / Partial Keep / Delete?** — and a short justification.

Focus on clarity, permanence, and signal over noise.
```

If you want, I can create a **mega-prompt** that auto-detects which mode to use—but these two should cover most of your cleanup workflow.

---

**User:**

Give me the mega prompt for kicks and giggles. 

---

**Assistant:**

Here’s the **“for-kicks-and-giggles MEGA prompt”**—a single monster you can drop at the end of any chat to squeeze out:  
- a roll-up,  
- topic map,  
- decisions + actions,  
- archival value score,  
- keep/delete suggestion,  
- Obsidian-ready structure.

All inside one code block, clean and ready to paste.

```md
You are my end-of-conversation auditor.

**Your tasks:**

1. **Conversation Roll-Up (200–300 words max)**  
   - Extract only the durable insights, decisions, and reusable reasoning.  
   - Ignore chit-chat, troubleshooting dead ends, or duplicated thinking.

2. **Topic Map**  
   - List the 3–7 core topics the conversation truly covered.  
   - For each: one crisp bullet describing what was resolved or learned.

3. **Decisions & Actions**  
   - Pull out any decisions I actually made.  
   - List any actions implied or explicitly stated.  
   - Keep it tight and literal.

4. **Usefulness Assessment**  
   - Rate the entire conversation’s long-term value: **0–100**  
     - 0–30 = discardable  
     - 31–60 = archive lightly  
     - 61–80 = worth keeping with a short note  
     - 81–100 = fully integrate  
   - Explain your score in 3–5 sentences.  
   - State clearly: **Keep**, **Archive**, or **Delete**.

5. **Obsidian-Ready Output**  
   Produce two sections:
   - **“Daily Note Snippet”** → tiny 5–8 line digest suitable for that day’s note.  
   - **“Long-Form Note Draft”** → if the usefulness score is >60, turn the roll-up into a tidy note draft with heading hierarchy. If ≤60, state “Not recommended for long-form capture.”

**Tone/Rules:**  
- No filler. No generic advice. No moralizing.  
- Treat this as a compression + signal extraction pass.  
- Prioritize clarity and concision.

Begin.
```

---

**Assistant:**

Here’s the short version: **keep warranties/PDFs in OneDrive unless you actually reference them; don’t contaminate your “thinking tools” with cold storage.**

Now the breakdown:

## 1. Your system is already cleanly partitioned
You’ve drawn a crisp line:
- **Apple Notes** → plans, short-lived reference, frictionless capture.  
- **Obsidian** → authored knowledge, writing, thinking, prompts, archives of your own work.  
- **OneDrive** → the big basement box of “files I technically own.”

This is already a strong architecture. The only missing piece is deciding which of the cold-storage files deserve promotion.

## 2. Principle: Put a thing where you *act on it*
Warranties, appliance manuals, old PDFs?  
You don’t “think” with them (Obsidian).  
You don’t “quick reference” them often (Apple Notes).  
They’re classic “rarely needed but must exist” material.

That makes them perfect for OneDrive.

## 3. When to *promote* a file into Notes or Obsidian
Use these triggers:

### Promote to **Obsidian** when:
- You’re **processing** the file into your own knowledge (summaries, thoughts, rewrites).  
- It becomes **part of your creative or professional system** (writing sample, resume versions, drafts).  
- It really is **your output**, not something you downloaded.

### Promote to **Apple Notes** when:
- It’s something you might realistically need on your phone, fast, in the real world.  
  Examples:  
  - Car insurance details  
  - Vaccine records you show twice a year  
  - A cheat-sheet or checklist you actually use  
  - A PDF you look at once every few months for home maintenance

If you haven’t needed a document in 12 months? It belongs in OneDrive.

## 4. Goal: consolidate *mental* storage, not *file* storage
You don't need to cram everything into one app.  
You need all your **active, attention-consuming stuff** consolidated.

So:
- **Apple Notes** = active planning + at-hand reference  
- **Obsidian** = active thinking + durable authored knowledge  
- **OneDrive** = everything that shouldn’t bother you unless you search for it

## 5. Suggested workflow for the OneDrive cleanup
Fast and painless:

1. **Create three temp folders** inside OneDrive:  
   - `Archive` (keep)  
   - `Review Later` (unsure)  
   - `Delete`

2. **Drag whole clusters at once**, not individual files.  
   (Sorting by folder is much faster than by file.)

3. Any file that looks like:
   - a manual  
   - an invoice  
   - a random PDF  
   - an old download  

   → **Archive** (don’t overthink it)

4. Anything you wrote or created:  
   → skim quickly  
   - Still meaningful? → Obsidian  
   - Meh? → Archive or Delete

5. After the dust settles, revisit `Review Later` once a quarter for 10 minutes.

## 6. Answering your core question directly
**Should warranties, PDF documents, appliance manuals go into Notes or Obsidian?**

**No. Keep them in OneDrive.**  
They’re not thinking material and they clutter the other two systems.

If you need fast access occasionally, drop *links* to them in Notes—don’t move the files.

---

Does this match your intent, or is there another edge case you want to poke at?

---
