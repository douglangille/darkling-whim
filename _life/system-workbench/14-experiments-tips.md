# Experiments & Unexpected Productivity Tips

## Light Mode Work Apps Experiment

### Concept

Force work apps (Teams, Outlook, M365, Edge) into **permanent light mode**, while everything else follows auto dark/light based on sunrise/sunset.

### Purpose

Passive restriction/signaling:
- Glaring white screen at night signals "off the clock"
- Introduces friction against after-hours pseudo-productivity

### Mechanism

**Cognitive dissonance**:
- Brain-dissonance of mixed light/dark modes is strong for user
- Acts as sensory tripwire
- Context cue for time-of-day and intention

### Context

- **Higher ed** (not healthcare)
- Most things can wait
- Real problem = pseudo-productivity from after-hours email/Teams
- Not about devices, but about time-of-day boundaries

### Assessment

**"Gem if layered, not cure-all"**:
- Effective as one layer in boundary system
- "Squeaky hinge" — irritating enough to deter casual use
- Passive friction, not enforcement

### Status

- Treated as **experiment only**
- No heavy framing
- Logged for potential future blog entry
- Part of "Doug's Unexpected Productivity Tips" (explicitly **not** "hacks")

### Open Loops

- Surface collected experiments when preparing blog content
- Option to expand into broader **sensory signaling system** if experiment proves useful

### Discardables

- Technical implementation details (themes, scripts) — unnecessary for experiment framing
- No need to over-design or formalize at this stage

## Other Quirky Productivity Experiments

### Tracked for Future Content

- Assistant tracking similar quirky-but-grounded experiments
- To be surfaced when user prepares to write/share
- Philosophy: practical, testable, not gimmicky

## Trophy Room Concept

### Status

Pinned for future reactivation.

### Potential Integration

- Dashboard tied to health data visualization
- Part of broader life-systems design

## Narrative OS

### Status

Productivity system concept pinned for future reactivation.

### Potential Implementation

Apple Notes-based (open loop).

## Scene-Based Productivity

### Philosophy

**Scene-based, not saga-based**:
- Reframes "keeping up with everything"
- Acknowledges limits
- Reduces overwhelm
- Aligns with neurodivergent-friendly workflows

### Applications

- RSS strategy (skim vs. archive)
- Task management (Now/Next/Later)
- Creative work (focus vs. worldbuilding)

## Discarded Gimmicks

- Overly rigid systems
- Guilt-based accountability
- Scorecard mentality
- "Keeping up" illusions
