# Digital Environment Pruning

## Guiding Principles

- **Intentional, low-clutter productivity environment**
- Bookmarks = frequently accessed tools only
- RSS = current thinking (Signal/Noise folders)
- Apple Notes = long-term reference capture

## Guiding Question

"If I use the app, do I need the bookmark?" (and vice versa)

## Bookmarks Strategy

### Keep
- Frequently accessed tools
- Unique, high-value content not available via RSS

### Delete
- Frameworks tracked via RSS (Monthly Method, Agile Results)
- Book summary sites (Nat Eliason, Four Minute Books) → use ChatGPT summaries or YouTube instead
- Sites tracked via RSS for ambient awareness (e.g., Maggie Appleton)

### Special Case: VS Code
- Keep as **webapp bookmark only** (vscode.dev)
- All usage is GitHub-adjacent
- Local install unnecessary
- Archiving via git + Homebrew available if needed

## App Pruning

### Test-and-Trim Approach

1. Evaluate: Is app redundant with mobile web?
2. Short testing period
3. Delete if redundant

### Keep
- **Banking apps**: Secure biometrics, high frequency

### Delete After Testing
- BlueCross (redundant with mobile web)
- YourHealthNS (redundant with mobile web)

## Archiving Strategy

### ChangingMinds.org
- Archived with `wget` as digital backup
- Preserves high-value, low-access resources outside active workflows
- Not in bookmarks or feeds

## Apple Notes Reference Vault

### Purpose
- Individual posts
- Rare insights
- Long-term mental models
- **Not** entire sites or feeds

### Future
- Possibly create boilerplate note template for Reference Vault entries (open loop)

## Conceptual Extraction

### Plaintext Productivity
- **Site**: Not personally usable
- **Concepts kept**:
  - Cognitive sovereignty
  - Modularity
  - Antifragility
- **Bookmark**: Deleted
- **Pattern**: Extract value before discarding operational tools

## Open Loops

- Revisit "Narrative Productivity OS" implementation in Apple Notes
- Boilerplate note template for Reference Vault entries
- Future triage of remaining phone apps/bookmark combos as part of digital environment audit

## Discarded

- Nat Eliason book notes bookmark (replaced by ChatGPT summaries)
- Four Minute Books website bookmark (replaced by YouTube feed)
- Plaintext Productivity as operational tool (kept conceptual insights only)
