# Creative Writing Workflow

## AI Novel Machine Pipeline

End-to-end workflow from concept → final manuscript:

1. Premise generation
2. Synopsis & themes
3. POV/tense/style lock
4. Character roster & deep dives
5. Setting bible
6. Act/chapter outline
7. Scene seeds
8. Beat sheets
9. Prose drafting
10. Continuity/style passes
11. Thematic/arc reviews
12. Final compilation

## Framework Options

- 4-Act/40-Chapter
- Save the Cat
- Hero's Journey
- Genre-driven selection

## Creative Prose Mode

### System Prompt
"Base GPT-5, narrative mode, no chat" — extended version exists for custom instructions.

### Scene Kickoff Template
- Minimal format
- Pulls briefs from story bible
- Metadata lives in bible (tone, POV, etc.) — not re-entered each session
- Paired with Creative Prose Mode system prompt
- Emulates Standard GPT-5 behavior within ChatGPT

## GPT-5 Creative Advantages

- Sharper in-session continuity
- Proactive scene generation
- Adaptive tone
- More gestural prompting (less rigid prompt engineering)
- Better memory
- Collaborative behavior
- Reduced babysitting

## Creative Boundaries

- **R-rated**: Violence, intimacy, grit — fully available
- **NC-17**: Explicit sexual/violent content — not available, not needed
- User confirmed comfortable working within R-rated limits

## Maggie & Grayson Universe

- Fiction universe where GPT-5 orchestration will be leveraged
- Experimental "vibe prompts" planned
- Test sandbox/system prompt for GPT-5 creative workflow (open loop)

## Story Bible Strategy

- Metadata stored in story bible
- File structure optimization for GPT-5 ingestion (open loop)
- ChatGPT pulls scene briefs on demand
- Condensed one-pager merging prompt + kickoff (open loop)

## Voice Dial

- Future creative writing style guide should include "voice dial" section
- Allows tone calibration without switching models
- GPT-5 confirmed able to produce cinematic writing styles when prompted

## Projects as RAG-Lite

- Better indexing
- Semantic retrieval
- Multi-file synthesis
- Persistence within a project
- Not full RAG, but improved over earlier models
