13. **[Cross-Platform Workflows](13-cross-platform.md)** - Gemini → ChatGPT, Markdown migrations

## Key Concepts

### System Architecture
- **Labs**: Domain ideation (persistent)
- **Projects**: Deliverables (short-lived)
- **ZORA**: Obsidian vault (continuity historian)
- **Memory**: Curated cross-chat context
- **ChatMerge**: Append-only XML ledger

### Now–Next–Later (NNL)
Outcome-oriented framework applied across:
- Microsoft Planner (work)
- Apple Reminders (personal)
- Novel writing (creative)

### Doug's Default Day
Nutrition OS targeting:
- 50/25/25 plate ratio
- ~80% adherence
- Neutral awareness (not scorekeeping)

### GPT-5 Orchestration
- Proactive routing
- Better memory
- Reduced prompt engineering
- Creative Prose Mode for fiction

## Rolling Summary Method

When requested, generate complete summaries with four sections:
- **Canon**: Established facts, architectures, distinctions
- **Decisions**: Commitments, settled choices, operational rules
- **Open Loops**: Pending work, unresolved items, future experiments
- **Discardables**: Explicitly parked content, metaphors, rejected approaches

## Cluster Themes

Summaries organized by theme (not chronology):
- AI & Creative Workflows
- Productivity Systems & Experiments
- Health & Diet
- Information Management
- Framework Integration

## Custom Instructions Compressed

See [Interaction Rules](04-interaction-rules.md) for the full compressed custom instructions used in ChatGPT.

## Open Loops Across All Files

- Quarterly Memory review cadence
- Naming/versioning for Labs & Projects
- Writing style guide with "voice dial"
- Finish AI Writing Studio course
- GPT-5 creative sandbox/system prompt
- 2-week meal rotation (Sobeys/Foodland)
- CLEAR framework handout for faculty
- Optimized bible file structure for GPT-5
- Track GPT voice rollout (Onyx, Alloy)
- Trophy Room + Narrative OS concepts

## Philosophy

"Workbench, not warehouse" applies across:
- Obsidian vault design
- Digital environment pruning
- System architecture
- Life optimization

Everything is treated as an **intentional tool** (not a collection bucket).
