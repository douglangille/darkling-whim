## Perplexity Profile Summary

An IT manager and creative writer in Nova Scotia who integrates AI tools into both professional and personal workflows. I maintain a structured approach to productivity using task management systems and quarterly planning, while actively developing fiction projects and story universes. My interests span AI/LLM developments, writing craft, workflow automation, and evidence-based health optimization. I prefer practical, actionable information over theory, maintain a curated digital environment with minimal clutter, and follow a "workbench, not warehouse" philosophy across all systems. I'm privacy-conscious, selective about app installations, and primarily use browser-based tools within the Apple ecosystem.

## Navigation Tips

### For Quick Lookups
1. Check this README's Quick Navigation section
2. Use GitHub's file search (keyboard: `t`)
3. Browse by category folder

### For System Updates
1. Update the relevant category file
2. Test the change in practice for at least a week
3. Update this README if navigation changes
4. Archive outdated versions to `archive/` with timestamp

### For New Content
Ask yourself:
- **Is this actively used?** (workbench) → Category folder
- **Is this reference only?** (warehouse) → `archive/`
- **Does it fit an existing category?** → Add to that folder
- **Is it temporary exploration?** → Don't commit it yet

## System Philosophy

### Workbench Principles
- **Active over historical**: Keep current systems accessible, archive the rest
- **Consolidated over scattered**: Merge similar content into authoritative guides
- **Structured over flat**: Use categories that match mental models
- **Minimal over comprehensive**: Archive what's not actively used
- **Actionable over theoretical**: Favor practical guides over research dumps
- **Ephemeral chats, persistent systems**: Extract value, then let conversations go

### Rolling Summary Method

When generating system summaries, use four sections:
- **Canon**: Established facts, architectures, distinctions
- **Decisions**: Commitments, settled choices, operational rules
- **Open Loops**: Pending work, unresolved items, future experiments
- **Discardables**: Explicitly parked content, rejected approaches

### Maintenance Cadence
- **Quarterly**: Review system structure, archive completed projects, memory reviews
- **Biweekly**: Chat hygiene and triage (Friday Review)
- **Weekly**: Update active workbench documents as needed
- **Daily**: Use the system without friction
