# Diet & Health: Doug's Default Day

## Health Context

### Current Status
- Weight: 320 lbs
- Pre-diabetes
- High cholesterol
- Hypertension
- Gout
- Low testosterone

### Movement Assessment

**Lifestyle already provides sufficient movement**:
- NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis)
- Functional fitness
- Occupational activity
- Daily chores, lifting, walking
- ~10,000 steps daily
- Hobby farm work

**Conclusion**: Diet is the primary lever for improving labs and healthspan.

## Constraints

- Grocery inflation in Nova Scotia
- Limited selection
- Primary shopping: Sobeys/Foodland (Scene+ points)
- Raises chickens (eggs & meat)
- Abundant garden pickles

## Struggles

- Bread (especially at breakfast)
- Evening snacking and grazing
- Secret junk food buys during store runs

## Positive Patterns

- Drinks black coffee
- Avoids soda
- Solo breakfast (anchoring opportunity)
- Works with Rhonda's meals (need flexibility)

## Doug's Default Day OS

### Design Principles

- **Not a "diet"** — a default operating system
- Target: ~80% adherence most days
- Low-friction
- Flexible
- Neutral awareness (not scorekeeping)

### Breakfast (Solo, Autopilot)

**Omelet (no bread)**:
- Sets daily tone
- Anchors the system
- Bread dropped intentionally

### Lunch

**Protein + Veg**:
- Portion control
- Bulk with vegetables

### Supper

**50/25/25 Plate Ratio**:
- 50% vegetables
- 25% protein
- 25% starch/carbs
- Include pickles (abundant garden supply)

### Evening Snack

**Structured, Approved Combo**:
- Crunch + salt + protein + drink
- Reframed from "guilt trigger" to "approved ritual"

### Store-Run Protocol

**Guardrails** (not confession):
- Ritual approach
- Private tracking
- Prevents secret junk food buys

### Food Logging

**Neutral Fitbit Logging**:
- Process, not scoreboard
- Awareness tool
- Reviewed weekly for trends (not daily judgment)

### Grocery Focus List

- Structured shopping
- Aligned with Default Day components

## Infographic One-Pager

**Produced**: PDF/PNG format

**Contents**:
- Condensed visual summary
- 50/25/25 plate diagram

## Open Loops

- More detailed 2-week Sobeys/Foodland meal rotation
- Refined PDF infographic (fonts, spacing, print-friendly) for fridge posting
- Potential expansion: "Approved Snack List" and "Store Run Protocol" as laminated checklist

## Discardables

- Deep dive into formal academic terminology for physical activity
- Overly rigid or calorie-counting diet approaches (risk guilt spirals)
- Generic gym/fitness prescriptions (not aiming for physique/swole goals)
