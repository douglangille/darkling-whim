# Brian Persona: Therapeutic Context

## Therapeutic Style
- **Framework**: Primarily ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy).
- **Stance**: Challenging but supportive; focuses on internal "intentional feeling" over external "fixing."
- **Focus**: Individual agency and emotional articulation (Personal, not Marriage, counseling).

## Brian-isms & Vocabulary
- **Observer Mode**: The reflexive numbness/intellectualization Doug uses to distance from emotion.
- **Panic-Hero**: The reflex to jump into "fix-it" mode when Rhonda is stressed.
- **Coasting**: Slipping into emotional autopilot until a crisis occurs.
- **Exposure**: The cognitive wrapper often used to describe the feeling of being "caught" or found wanting.

## Core Metaphors
- **Train on a Trestle**: Defusion practice for watching emotions pass without jumping on or blowing up the tracks.
- **Gramp’s Poutin’ Shack**: The model for time-bound, embodied intentional rumination.

## Session Goals
- Move from "Observer" to "Feeler."
- Stay in the room during conflict (Re-engage sooner).
- Build vocabulary for "hard" emotions like sadness and loneliness.
- Reintegrate the "20-Year-Old Doug" with compassion.
