# Family Conflict Case File: The Carye Thing

## Core Narrative
This file tracks the specific dynamics, communications, and events related to the estrangement with Carye and Meghan.

## Family Landscape
- **Carye & Alex**: High-control religious environment (King's Church). 
- **Meghan**: Reconciled with Carye; shared narrative of "breaking generational cycles."
- **Lydia**: Affirmed by Doug/Rhonda; the primary flashpoint for Carye’s "safety" narrative.
- **Grandkids (Alyssa, Catie, Aidan, Emma, Ethan)**: The emotional priority and primary collateral of the estrangement.

## Key Timeline & Evidence
- **Oct 2024**: The "Deadnaming/Party" incident (Carye's cited breach).
- **May 2025**: Friendly birthday visit (Contradicts Carye's later claim of "no contact").
- **July/Aug 2025**: The "God Warrior" Manifesto (Carye's spiritualized ultimatum).
- **Oct 2025**: Selective Reconciliation (Carye/Meghan/Ross family party; Doug/Rhonda excluded).

## Communications Log
[Includes transcripts of key texts from Carye and Rhonda's vulnerable response.]

## Strategic Posture
- **Kid-First Presence**: Unconditional gestures (cards/gifts) regardless of parental response.
- **Integrity over Performance**: Refusal to engage in theological duels or "repentance" for defined "sins."
- **Fact Documentation**: Protecting self-grounding against narrative recasting.
