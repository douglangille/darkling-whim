# Family Conflict Case File: The Carye Thing

## Core Narrative
This file tracks the specific dynamics, communications, and events related to the estrangement with Carye and Meghan.

## Family Landscape
- **Carye & Alex (The Leightons)**: High-control religious environment (King's Church). 
- **Meghan**: Reconciled with Carye; shared narrative of "breaking generational cycles."
- **Lydia**: Affirmed by Doug/Rhonda; the primary flashpoint for Carye’s "safety" narrative.
- **Grandkids (Alyssa, Catie, Aidan, Emma, Ethan)**: The emotional priority and primary collateral of the estrangement.

## Key Timeline & Evidence
- **Oct 2024**: The "Deadnaming/Party" incident (Carye's cited breach).
- **May 2025**: Friendly birthday visit (Contradicts Carye's later claim of "no contact").
- **July/Aug 2025**: The "God Warrior" Manifesto (Carye's spiritualized ultimatum).
- **Oct 2025**: Selective Reconciliation (Carye/Meghan/Ross family party; Doug/Rhonda excluded).
- **Nov 2025**: Alyssa's birthday. Proposed crochet lessons never materialize as Carye fails to make time.
- **Dec 11, 2025**: Christmas Concert. Doug and Rhonda attend but sit separately. After leaving, Alex calls them back; emotional reunion where Rhonda and Alyssa are both in tears.
- **Dec 24, 2025**: Christmas Eve supervised visit. After much "back-and-forth," Doug and Rhonda spend one hour at the Leighton house to drop off gifts.
- **Jan 2026**: Carye continues passive-aggressive Facebook posts regarding "healing from family trauma." She begins a January social media fast/break.
- **Jan 10, 2026 (Planned)**: Doug and Rhonda plan to watch the girls curl on Saturday morning to maintain presence.

## Communications Log
- **Manifesto (Aug 2025)**: Carye frames estrangement as "Spirit-led" and moral protection.
- **Rhonda's Response (Nov 2025)**: Vulnerable, asking for "rules of the road" and clarifying intent vs. impact.
- **Dec 2025**: High-friction coordination for Christmas Eve; limited to "Merry Christmas/Happy New Year" via Messenger.

## Strategic Posture
- **Kid-First Presence**: Maintaining visibility at public events (curling, concerts) when direct access is gatekept.
- **Integrity over Performance**: Refusal to engage in the "family trauma" narrative used to justify exclusion.
- **Fact Documentation**: Notaging the contradiction between "trauma" claims and the Leighton's proximity (visiting neighbors nearby while ignoring Doug/Rhonda).
