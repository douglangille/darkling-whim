# Counselling Workbench: Source of Truth

This directory maintains the modular context for Doug's personal growth, therapy integration, and family conflict resolution. It is designed to be used as the primary data source for the **Counselling Workbench** Perplexity Space.

## Modular Components
1. **`brian-persona.md`**: 
   - Defines the therapeutic framework (ACT).
   - Maps specific vocabulary: "Observer Mode," "Panic-Hero," "The Train on a Trestle."
2. **`workbench-inner-work.md`**: 
   - Tracks active growth goals and session takeaways.
   - Contains the **Cumulative Playbook** of practical resilience strategies.
3. **`case-file-carye.md`**: 
   - Detailed narrative and evidence log of the family estrangement.
   - Used for conflict debriefs and strategy mapping.
4. **`personal-history.md`**: 
   - Life acts (1972–Present) and core metaphors like "Gramp’s Poutin’ Shack."
5. **`perplexity-space-instructions.md`**: 
   - The system prompt for configuring the Perplexity Space AI.

## Usage for AI Assistant
- **Priority**: Always read these files before providing advice or session prep.
- **Focus**: Doug's internal emotional experience ("Feeling Mode").
- **Updates**: Use `create_or_update_file` to save new session insights back to `workbench-inner-work.md`.
