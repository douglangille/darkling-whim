# Counselling Workbench: Inner Work & Integration

## Purpose
Dedicated space for personal growth, therapy integration (with Brian), and emotional articulation.

## Core Growth Themes
- **Observer Mode vs. Feeling Mode**: Moving from intellectualizing emotions to inhabiting them.
- **The "Panic-Hero" Reflex**: Shifting from fixing Rhonda's problems to being present with her.
- **Memory/Processing Differences**: Managing the mismatch between Doug's context-based memory and Rhonda's emotional memory.
- **The 20-Year-Old Doug (ACT)**: Reconciling with the younger self to address roots of shame and avoidance.

## Session Takeaways
- **Dec 8, 2025**: Explored the physiological "surge" (flush/nausea) vs. the positive pride felt with Lydia.
- **Oct 27, 2025**: Identified "Coasting" as a reflex of emotional autopilot.

## Resilience Playbook (Cumulative)
1. **Grounding**: Fact logs against narrative manipulation.
2. **Communication Modes**: Containment (neutral) vs. Voice (vulnerable).
3. **Intentional Feeling**: Numbness is a signal to breathe and feel.
4. **Partner-ish Presence**: Small affirmations of being "in it together."

## Open Loops
- Distinguishing healthy regulation from unhealthy avoidance.
- Building vocabulary for sadness and loneliness.
