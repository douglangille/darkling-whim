<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Relationships developed through a number of stages. Presented here is a comprehensive 
generic model, based on a wide review of other models. Note that it focuses on 
growth of the relationship and does not include subsequent breakdown stages. 
Also note that these stages are not all sequential. Phases 3 to 5 in 
particular are likely to have some overlap.</p>
<p>The duration of each phase may vary significantly, from moment to years, based 
on opportunity and motivation of the parties.</p>
<h2><a name="bef"></a>Phase 1: Before meeting</h2>
<p>Before the people in a relationship ever meet, there are a number of 
activities that may happen, leading up to the first meeting. If the meeting is 
by chance (or design of others) then this stage is effectively skipped.</p>
<h3>Knowing about them</h3>
<p>The first step is to know that they exist. One person usually knows first and 
the second person may not know until the first meeting.</p>
<p>Knowing about them may happen in various ways, for example a man may see a 
woman in a bar or a sales person hears of a possible customer from a colleague.</p>
<h3>Learning about them</h3>
<p>More information is often needed to motivate a desire for contact. This may 
be done by first-hand research, where the person actively looks for information 
by the other party. If there is a third person helping out, they may volunteer 
information, for example where a friend is 'match-making' or a company researches 
prospects for a salesperson.</p>
<h3>Wanting to meet</h3>
<p>With enough information, the motivation for a relationship begins. This can 
range from a cautious interest to early strong desire, such as when a woman sees 
a man she does not know at a party and is immediately attracted to him.</p>
<h3>Seeking contact</h3>
<p>With the motivation to meet, the next (and sometimes difficult) step is 
figuring out how to get to meet them. This may be through friends who will 
enquire if the other person is interested (and help them through this phase). </p>
<p>In sales, <a href="../../disciplines/sales/prospecting/cold_calling.htm">cold 
calling</a> is a difficult and often unrewarding activity and other methods of
<a href="../../disciplines/sales/prospecting/prospecting.htm">prospecting</a> 
may also be used to connect with possible customers.</p>
<h2><a name="get"></a>Phase 2: Getting to know you</h2>
<p>In this phase, contact is made with the other person and early negotiations 
lead either to departure or continuation of the relationship.</p>
<h3>First contact</h3>
<p>First contact with the other person is an important and difficult stage as 
early impressions are important although this is easy to get wrong. When we meet 
others we seek to classify them, typically using global or personal
<a href="../theories/stereotypes.htm">stereotypes</a> which are often inadequate 
for the decisions made at this time.</p>
<p>Typically, <a href="../../techniques/body/greeting.htm">greeting</a> between 
strangers is highly formalized, with handshakes, exchange of
<a href="../../techniques/conversation/name/name.htm">names</a> and simple 
pleasantries such as discussing the weather, local sports or other safe topics. </p>
<h3>Basic exchange</h3>
<p>Possibly within the first contact and possibly in subsequent meetings there 
is an exchange of information which allows each person to refine their 
impression of the other person and decide whether they want to continue with the 
relationship.</p>
<p>Exchange at this level typically includes a seeking of common factors such as 
origins, hobbies, families, friends, work and so on. There is also information 
exchange which helps with the next stage of deciding where to take the 
relationship. A typical question to help this is 'What do you do?', which 
effectively translates as 'how could you help me'. </p>
<h3>Deciding desired relationship</h3>
<p>From the information gained so far, the possibilities for the nature of an 
ongoing relationship should be clear, whether it is one of friendship, 
convenience, exchange or romance.</p>
<h3>Acquaintance</h3>
<p>If the relationship is not going to get any closer, then its development 
stops here. This is quite common and most people have many acquaintances with 
relatively few good friends. </p>
<p>The state of acquaintance is a safe position whereby there is no obligation 
between the two people and it is easy to refuse any request. Interaction is 
functional with a clear and simple request/response structure.</p>
<h2><a name="clo"></a>Phase 3: Getting close</h2>
<p>When both parties want to develop the relationship further, then there is 
more activity to get to a stronger closeness. </p>
<h3>Seeking more contact</h3>
<p>Getting closer means spending more time with the other person. This starts 
with proposals and continues with 'dates' in which pre-planned activities are 
jointly carried out.</p>
<h3>Revealing secrets</h3>
<p>A common part of developing intimacy is in revealing things about yourself 
that you would not easily tell others. This says 'I trust you' and encourages a 
reciprocal exposure of vulnerabilities.</p>
<h3>Dancing to and fro</h3>
<p>Coming together is seldom a single movement and often appears as a dance with 
one approaching, the other retreating then moving back in and so forth. This 
tests the determination and commitment of the other person in seeking a lasting 
relationship.</p>
<h3>Intensifying the relationship</h3>
<p>As the people get closer, the things that they do together show increasing 
commitment and sharing. The speed and depth of this stage will vary greatly with 
the relationship.</p>
<p>Romantically, this goes from touching to kissing to petting and intercourse. 
In sales it would include courting the customer, serious consideration of 
products and final sales. After sales the relationship may well continue with 
ongoing support and loyalty into referrals and future sales.</p>
<h2><a name="sta"></a>Phase 4: Stabilizing</h2>
<p>Even when the relationship seems to have reached its peak, there is more work 
to do to create a stable, longer-term relationship.</p>
<h3>Honeymoon</h3>
<p>After first getting together there is often a 'honeymoon' period when 
everything goes wonderfully well and each person cannot imagine not being in the 
relationship. </p>
<p>In studies of romantic relationships, it has been show that can last up to 
two years. However, in the end, reality bites, the wings dissolve and the 
parties either find a working 'normal' relationship or otherwise drift apart.</p>
<h3>Storming</h3>
<p>After having a close relationship with someone for a while, those endearing 
little affections can turn into annoying habits as the little things that you 
once forgave become major irritations.</p>
<p>The relationship may also become rather one-sided as one person does much 
more of the running and the other sits back and lets it happen. Again, for the 
person putting in the effort this can be rather annoying.</p>
<p>The relationship can consequently turn from being relatively harmonious to 
being marked with regular disagreement and acrimonious argument.</p>
<p>This is another stage at which the relationship may break up if the challenge 
to ongoing stability is not met. </p>
<p>Sometimes relationships can remain in the storming stage for a long period, 
resulting in a long journey along a very rocky road which bumps and grinds and 
wears everyone down.</p>
<h3>Stabilizing</h3>
<p>If there is still sufficient commitment for the relationship to continue, 
differences need to be resolved or at least moved to an acceptably workable 
footing.</p>
<p>If storming has been particularly acrimonious then the partners may have hurt 
one another deeply. This may require deliberate reconciliation with support from 
a third party mediator or counselor of some sort. </p>
<p>Acceptance, understanding and heartfelt apology are common in this stage, as 
is constructive dialog that works towards an effective long-term relationship in 
which neither is overly dominant and where each puts effort into meeting the 
needs of the other.</p>
<h2><a name="dev"></a>Phase 5: Developing commitments</h2>
<p>Alongside and within the previous two phases commitments may be made to the 
relationship and to one another.</p>
<h3>Internal commitment</h3>
<p>Along the way and at particular times, the individual person mulls over the 
relationship and its importance and makes personal decisions to commit time and 
effort to making the relationship work. </p>
<p>Trust is an important driver of this - if I do not trust you, then I would 
put myself at risk if I made commitments. </p>
<h3>Demonstrating commitment</h3>
<p>When a commitment is demonstrated to the other person, it encourages them to 
also show their commitment in return and so deepen the relationship. 
Demonstration of commitment includes such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Giving one's time to the other</li>
	<li>Keeping appointments (and arriving on time)</li>
	<li>Talking up the partner in conversations with other people</li>
	<li>Providing emotional support in times of distress</li>
	<li>Giving gifts and otherwise transferring resources to the other</li>
</ul>
<h3>Socializing </h3>
<p>Demonstrating commitment also sends a message to other people that this is an 
important relationship. When we make something public, it becomes harder to go 
back on the commitment.</p>
<h3>Formalizing the commitment</h3>
<p>There are a number of ways in which a commitment may be formalized, and so 
making it harder for either party to renege on the agreement. In a commercial 
situation, contracts are commonly used. In romantic relationships, commitments 
include moving in together, getting married and having children. </p>

<h1><a name="So"></a>So what?</h1>

<p>Understand these stages and see if they make sense in your own relationships. 
Where it works for you, facilitate the relationship forward to the point where 
you want it go go.</p>
