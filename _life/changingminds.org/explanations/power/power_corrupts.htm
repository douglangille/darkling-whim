Corruption</a>&nbsp;| <a href="#So">
So what?</a></p>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a famous saying, 'Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts 
absolutely.' There is much truth in this.</p>
<h2><a name="pow"></a>Powerful behavior</h2>
<p>The behavior of a powerful person often leads much to be desired. Some of the 
unsocial things they may do include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Being disinterested in the welfare of others.</li>
	<li>Stereotyping others, including showing bias.</li>
	<li>Not making eye contact when in conversation.</li>
	<li>Acting as if they are entitled to get what they want.</li>
	<li>Expecting others to comply with their requirements without question.</li>
	<li>Acting in untrustworthy ways, but expecting to be trusted.</li>
	<li>Having different rules and <a href="../values/values.htm">values</a> for 
	themself vs. other people.</li>
	<li>Being more prone to anger than others. </li>
	<li>Acting outside company policy or creating it for their own purpose.</li>
	<li>Breaking the law.</li>
	<li>Believing they are untouchable and above the law.</li>
	<li>Colluding with other powerful people in immoral and illegal acts.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="int"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>A person gets introduced to power at an early age, when parents have total 
control over their lives. They then discover that they have the ability to 
control their parents through actions that range from fluttering eyelashes to 
screaming fits. This makes them feel good.</p>
<p>In life and business, the game continues, of being under the power of others 
and finding one's own power. The person finds out how one gains power, for 
example by playing the 
game whilst bending the rules. </p>
<p>Initially, they may have good intent, seeking to build the company, help 
others succeed and so on. With this sound purpose, they excuse themselves for 
small indiscretions, as the minor means is clearly worth meeting the far greater 
ends. </p>
<p>Many <a href="../../techniques/conversion/cults.htm">cult</a> leaders start 
out this way, doing good and helping others. But before long the power goes to 
their head as they are seduced by the powerful feeling it gives them.</p>
<h2><a name="sed"></a>Seduction</h2>
<p>Power is seductive not only because it is the means by which you can get what 
you want, but also because it gives you the confidence that goes along with this 
knowledge. Seduction is often an
<a href="../../techniques/general/more_methods/incremental.htm">incremental</a> 
process. It happens one small step at a time, almost imperceptibly. Actions are 
justified with thoughts such as 'just this once' or 'it's important'. </p>
<p><a href="../theories/acquired_needs.htm">McClelland</a> describes the need 
for power as one of the basic things we seek. Power can also been as a 
fundamental means by which the basic need for a sense of
<a href="../needs/control.htm">control</a> is achieved. Beyond this, it can also 
play a significant role in boosting our sense of <a href="../needs/identity.htm">
identity</a>. After a while, we begin to feel that power is a part of our inner 
self, that we <i>are </i>powerful people, and that losing it would be something akin to an identity crisis, where we 
no longer know who we really are.</p>
<p>In this way, playing to deep needs, power becomes seductive, drawing us in. 
When people look up to us and treat us like gods, then it is too easy to believe 
them and assume we really are superior. What we miss is that they are in awe of 
the power, not the inner person. When company managers retire, many are 
perplexed by the lack of respect to which they had become accustomed. </p>
<h2><a name="add"></a>Addiction</h2>
<p>In addiction, a person starts to want something for its own sake. The 
alcoholic drinks not because it makes him or her happy, but because it has 
become deeply ingrained and the thought of living without that numbing alcoholic 
haze is so scary. </p>
<p>The same is true of the power addict: the though of not having power is so 
frightening, they are driven to seek more and more power, even though they may 
well never use it. Like a miser, the power addict just want to have it.</p>
<p>Addiction leads to actions that are unhealthy. Addicts lose their sense of 
social goals and turn inwards, wanting only to satisfy their craving. In this 
way, it becomes easier and easier to fall into corruption.</p>
<h2><a name="cor"></a>Corruption</h2>
<p>A critical problem for people in power is not so much how to achieve their 
goals -- they now have the power to do this -- it is to sustain their humanity 
and not fall into the pit of corruption.</p>
<h3>The paradox of power</h3>
<p>The 'paradox of power' describes how people need and use social skills to 
gain positions of power, yet when they reach that position they seem to forget 
how to be civil to other people.</p>
<p>One reason for this is that people in power meet many others who want 
something from them. These people may want the powerful person to use their power for 
some particular purpose. They may just want to bask in the reflected glory. 
Either way, the powerful person feels isolated.</p>
<p>Another reason for becoming uncivil is that the person is naturally that way, 
but is skilled at appearing to be civil. They hence used these skills on the way 
up, but now that they have 'made it', they fall back into their truer, less kind 
self.</p>
<h3>Exchange and obligation</h3>
<p>On the way up and in maintaining their position of power, the person may 
well have been helped by others on the tacit understanding that the favor will 
be called in at a future date. They hence may be called on to do something that 
they do not really want to do, but which they still feel obliged to do.</p>
<p>Powerful social <a href="../groups/groups.htm">groups</a> are often like 
this, with ritual back-scratching and helping one another to ensure that their 
power is sustained. In conversation,
<a href="../theories/out-group_homogeneity.htm">out-group</a>, lower-power 
people are <a href="../theories/stereotypes.htm">stereotyped</a> and considered 
inferior.</p>
<p>Corrupt people like to deal with other corrupt people. When everyone is in it 
up to their necks, everyone also knows that nobody else is going to blow the 
whistle, exposing the corruption to external eyes. In this way, corrupt systems 
are self-sustaining. </p>
<p>Criminal and street gangs work in a similar way as they get recruits to break 
the law as a part of the induction process, thereby giving the gang power over 
the person should they ever wish to leave.</p>
<h1><a name="So"></a>So what?</h1>

<p>If you achieve power, remember your <a href="../values/values.htm">values</a> 
and sustain your humanity. Use your power for good, helping others as well as 
gaining what you personally want.</p>
<p>If you are faced with a corrupt person in power, then if you want to persuade 
them, seek to understand the inner person. Beware of being corrupted yourself, 
drawing the line beforehand and never stepping over it. Powerful people 
recognize powerful attitudes. If you act as if you have power, then they may 
cede this to you. If you act as a weak underling, then they may persecute you as 
a victim. </p>
