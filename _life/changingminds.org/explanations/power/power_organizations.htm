<h1>Power in Organizations</h1>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="../explanations.htm">Explanations</a>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<a href="power.htm">Power</a> 
&gt; Power in Organizations</p>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here is a list sources of power that may be found in organizations (Morgan, 
1986), with further commentary</p>
<h3>Formal authority</h3>
<p>The simplest form of power is that vested in the position of 'manager'. A 
manager has subordinates who must do his or her bidding, only within legal and 
organizational rules. The basic employment
<a href="../../disciplines/leadership/styles/transactional_leadership.htm">
transaction</a> is 'we give you money, you do as your are told'.<p>Of course 
there are many more ways that power can be exerted, and in particular in 
motivating people more effectively such as is found in
<a href="../../disciplines/leadership/styles/transformational_leadership.htm">
transformational leadership</a>.<h3>
Control of scarce resources</h3>
<p>
Other than directing employees, managers control budgets and the assets and 
other resources that the firm holds, from technology to people. A part of this 
control is the ability to allocate these resources to projects and other work.</p>
<p>
It is not unsurprising that many of the political battles in organizations is 
over control of resources and 'empire-building' is a classic game, with a 
significant risk that organizational goals get forgotten in the cut and thrust 
of winning and losing control of resources.</p>
<h3>
Use of organizational structure, rules and regulations</h3>
<p>
Organizations have hierarchies, departments, teams and other structures, often 
each with its own rules as well as the rules that govern the action within the 
organization as a whole. Many people do not know all of these rules, which makes 
them a source of power for those who care to take time to learn their detail.
</p>
<p>
Power can also be gained from quoting rules that do not exist or misquoting 
rules by overstating or understating their meaning.</p>
<h3>
Control of decision processes</h3>
<p>
Work is selected and resources are allocated by decisions, many of which are 
decided in some form by groups of people. By managing how decisions are made, 
for example by requiring consensus or senior-manager signoff, the power of some 
people may be curtailed whilst others gain the ability to shape decisions. </p>
<p>
When decisions are made in committee or other meetings, the person who chairs 
the meeting or keeps the minutes may have notable power to control decisions.</p>
<h3>
Control of knowledge and information</h3>
<p>
Knowledge is power, as they say, and how you gather and distribute it is a 
source of power, whether it is technical or social information. </p>
<p>
Experts often work in this way, protecting their elevated status by hiding the 
sources of their knowledge and exacting high prices (whether financial or 
social) for their learned opinions.</p>
<h3>
Control of boundaries</h3>
<p>
The structures and groups of the organization are only so because they have 
boundaries which people cross in order to access resources and meet people. 
Thus, for example, an executive's Personal Assistant may have disproportionate 
power in the ability to allow access or not to the executive. Likewise security 
guards, though not paid very much can allow, bar or hassle people crossing their 
boundaries.</p>
<h3>
Ability to cope with uncertainty</h3>
<p>
A quite different source of power is personal resilience, the ability to handle 
uncertainty and stress that might debilitate others. Such people can gain 
position by taking on work that others fear and is a common route for 
upwardly-mobile go-getters who seek early promotion.</p>
<h3>
Control of technology</h3>
<p>
Technology is (or should be) an enabler, providing data, analysis, information, 
access and other benefits. Those who control what technology is used by the 
organization or who gets the latest computers and software has significant 
power, and the person who used to be the 'IT Manager' may now be the 'Chief 
Information Officer'.</p>
<p>
Having the latest technology can also be a status symbol, thereby giving the 
holder social power in the way they can show themselves to be influential and 
clever.</p>
<h3>
Interpersonal alliances, networks and control of &#8216;informal organization&#8217;</h3>
<p>
Who you know makes a lot of difference. We naturally help our friends and those 
who have helped us in some way in the past. Social networks are the glue of 
organizations and those who build and work their informal associates can thereby 
gain significantly more power.</p>
<p>
In the time when smoking was allowed but only in special 'smoking rooms', it was 
often said that this became a 'club' where the low and the high in the 
organization rubbed shoulders, which no doubt gave power to the lower people in 
the name-dropping they could use and and help they might get.</p>
<h3>
Control of counter-organizations</h3>
<p>
Not to every organization is there an equal and opposite counter-organization, 
but in the battlefield of businesses, whole ecologies spring up, include local 
opposition to factory expansion, trade unions seeking ever-increasing pay and 
benefits and so on. If you can infiltrate or otherwise hold some sway over the 
groups who might oppose you, you may at least be able to damp the danger they 
power and possibly neutralize them completely.</p>
<h3>
Symbolism and the management of meaning</h3>
<p>
We live a lot, more than perhaps we realize, in the sway of the symbols and
<a href="../critical_theory/schools/semiotics.htm">semiotics</a> of the 
workplace. If you can recognize the subtlety and understand the workings of how 
meaning is created, then you have a surprisingly powerful tool for change and 
influence.</p>
<p>
Symbols and meaning-making is a particular pattern of
<a href="../culture/culture.htm">culture</a>, and those who would change the 
underlying culture of an organization can make use of these.</p>
<h3>
Gender and the management of gender relations</h3>
<p>
In a balanced workplace, around half the people are men and half are women. In 
practice, some women gravitate towards particular roles whilst men seek other 
work positions. The 'glass ceiling' still exists in many companies and, perhaps 
due to life breaks such as having children, fewer women make it to the higher 
echelons. </p>
<p>
This can lead to frustrations and energy that can be put to good and destructive 
use. If you can harness this, you have power. There is also the power of sexual 
attraction, and tall and shapely people continue to make good use of their 
physical assets. </p>
<h3>
Structural factors that define the stage of action</h3>
<p>
The 'stage of action' in organizations is set up by the organizational purpose, 
vision, mission, strategy and other high-level shaping activities that lead to 
scenarios of activity, from driving into new markets to struggling with 
organizational change.</p>
<p>
If you can shape the direction of the organization, you have tremendous power to 
affect much of what it does and consequently the futures (and power) of others 
in the firm.</p>
<h3>
The power one already has</h3>
<p>
Last, but certainly not least, is the power of the individual. We can be 
charming, willing, obstinate and more. And we have feet we can use to leave the 
company at any time we choose.</p>

<h1><a name="So"></a>So what?</h1>

<p>So take note! If you are feeling powerless in an organization, think again 
and review the above list. Everyone has the ability to acquire and use more 
power than they might reasonably expect to have.</p>
