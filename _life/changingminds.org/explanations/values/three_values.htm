<h1>The &#39;Three Rs&#39;: Core Values to Teach Your Children (and Adopt 
Yourself)</h1>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="../explanations.htm">Explanations</a>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<a href="values.htm">Values</a> 
&gt; The &#39;Three Rs&#39;: Core Values to Teach Your Children (and Adopt 
Yourself)</p>
<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="#res">Respect</a> | <a href="#resp">
Responsibility</a> | <a href="#rob">Robustness</a> | <a href="#So">So what?</a></p>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Values are the basic rules we adopt for our lives, especially when 
interacting with other people. Sharing such values is the basis of a harmonious 
society, where we are able to live safely and comfortably with others, even strangers, 
who adopt the same approach. </p>
<p>While there are many values, much can be reduced to the &#39;3Rs&#39; of Respect, 
Responsibility and Robustness. This is a simple and clear set that not only can 
we all adopt, but which is easy to teach to children. </p>
<h2><a name="res"></a>Respect </h2>
<p><a href="../needs/respect.htm">Respect</a> is &#39;respect of&#39; someone or something. It is a mindset that leads to 
respectful action. </p>
<p>Respect means accepting people as they are, with all their differences. This 
does not mean that you should weakly give in to demands and ignore antisocial 
actions, but it does mean respecting the inner person, even when you may 
criticize what they say or do. </p>
<p>Respect means avoiding judgement, where you might assume the other person is 
bad in some ways. It means avoiding falling into the 
<a href="../theories/theory_of_mind.htm">Theory of Mind</a> trap, where 
we believe we know what others are thinking and feeling (and easily assume this 
is uncharitable and about us). </p>
<p>Respect starts with self-respect. How we think about others is often a 
reflection of our self-image. When we are truly comfortable in our own skin, it 
is much easier to respect others, too. Self-respect does not include arrogance, 
which is often a cover-up for poor self-respect. Indeed, much outer dysfunction 
is a sign of inner disharmony.</p>
<p>One of our deep drivers is the need for <a href="../needs/status.htm">status</a>, in which others 
<a href="../needs/acceptance.htm">accept</a> and 
<a href="../needs/approval.htm">admire</a> us, respecting our seniority and expertise. This can lead to 
disrespectful conflict as we gossip and climb over one another to get up the 
narrowing hierarchy. Paradoxically, we can gain more respect and support by 
giving respect. In showing integrity we can also expect respect in return. When 
others like the respect you give them, they may translate this into authority 
and start pushing you down. This is where simple assertiveness can be used to 
respectfully require respect.</p>
<p>Respect also includes respect for society and the social system that binds us 
together and reduces distrust and conflict. It means respecting rules, laws and 
social norms. This does not mean being a slavish prude, especially when this 
leads to the trap of always judging others. It does, however, mean understanding rules and only 
breaking them when there is very good reason. </p>
<p>Beyond our society, we should respect other societies, animals and nature at 
large. Respect for the planet translates into respect for future generations. It 
includes constraining our consumption and supporting long-term conservation 
goals. </p>
<p>Overall, then, we should show respect of ourselves, other people, society (and it&#39;s 
institutions and rules), and the natural world in which we live.<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="resp"></a>Responsibility </h2>
<p>Responsibility in this context is mostly &#39;responsibility for&#39; completing 
promises, taking action or accepting consequences of your past actions. You can 
also have &#39;responsibility for&#39; people or things when they are in your care. A 
further form 
is to have &#39;responsibility to&#39; a superior in carrying out commands or promises.
</p>
<p>Responsibility means doing the things we should do. But what &#39;should&#39; we do? 
These are often dictated by the roles we have, such as employee, friend and 
citizen. The employee has formally defined responsibilities, while friends have 
only informal, socially defined responsibilities. Citizens have a combination of 
the two, with both formal responsibility as laid down by law, and informal, 
socially defined responsibility. </p>
<p>We have free <a href="../../techniques/willpower/willpower.htm">will</a> and may or may not complete those tasks for which we have 
responsibility. This leads to questions of accountability and consequence. To 
whom are we accountable? Who has the authority to punish us or coerce us into 
action? At work, managers have such ability. At home, it may be parents or 
partners. In law, the police and courts keep 
us in line. And in the social sphere, values, morals and other unwritten norms 
may be strictly enforced by the people around us, including family, 
acquaintances and even complete strangers. </p>
<p>To do the jobs for which we have responsibility, we need resources, ability, 
motivation and support. Resources required include time, money, tools and 
materials. Ability includes knowledge and skill. Motivation gives us the energy 
to do the job, even when it gets boring or difficult. We may also need help from 
others, for example to provide some of the above or to legitimise our actions.
</p>
<p>Responsibility is often paired with authority. Authority lets you take 
decisions and allocate resources. It lets you assert expertize. it may increase 
your ability to influence and even command others. Sometimes also, 
responsibility and authority become separated. Managers may have command 
authority where they pass responsibility to subordinates and then sit in 
blameless judgement. The hapless employees get the other side of the coin, with 
responsibility but no authority in a potentially no-win, ser-up-to-fail 
scenario. Well-meaning social volunteers can have the same dilemma where they 
gave local politics and petty jealousies Children may see the adulthood they 
seek as having the freedom to do what they like with none of the responsibility.
</p>
<p>Sometimes responsibility is given, even if the person is unwilling. Managers 
assign responsibility to subordinates when they allocate tasks. Parents give 
chores to their children and expect them to study hard. We also expect friends 
to help us and to act in accordance with our own values. </p>
<p>Responsibility may also be taken, for example where a volunteer helps out 
with a local charity or an employee takes on extra work in the hope that it will 
help their career. Such responsibility may be taken by adopting ad-hoc roles 
that can vary in duration from moments to years. </p>
<p>We teach children about responsibility by giving them chores and explaining 
morality, then holding them accountable for these. We also socialise them with 
stories.</p>
<h2><a name="rob"></a>Robustness </h2>
<p>Robustness is largely about &#39;robustness of&#39; oneself in sustaining a 
functioning self and coping with issues. We can also show robustness in our 
actions, doing things that are reliable and long-lasting. </p>
<p>Life is full of disappointments and the motivation to pick oneself up and 
keep going is a critical skill. More than this, it is also an attitude and basic 
value borne out of a healthy self-respect and taking responsibility for oneself.</p>
<p>Robustness means having the courage to face risks and do what is right rather 
than what seems easy. It means having the character and integrity to act when 
others hold back. It means doing the right thing even if this is unpopular. It 
does not necessarily mean being foolhardy in the face of danger, but it 
certainly does not mean avoidance as a default action. </p>
<p>With a robust approach to life, it is easier to be independent, standing 
alone as needed. The emotional strength of robustness means you do not need to 
lean on others or depend on their support. </p>
<p>Robustness has a particular attitude towards failure where it is not seen as 
a bad thing nor taken as being shameful. Quite the reverse, failure is welcomed 
as an opportunity to learn. Even though failure can be disappointing, a robust 
character who is knocked down picks themself up, dusts themself down, and looks 
for learning that can help make things better next time. </p>
<p>Often, robustness means standing up for what you believe to be right. It 
means standing your ground and fighting your corner, even when you seem alone in 
your views. More likely is that others date not day what you voice, and that 
they may, with encouragement, rally to your flag. Robustness is attractive and 
convincing. It is hence an attribute of leaders who achieve significant change.
</p>
<p>Persistence is another attribute of robustness. When others might give up, 
having a dogged determination can help people win through difficult or simply 
boring times. Sometimes you need various resources and support, and sometimes 
you just need to keep going. </p>
<p>We can even be &#39;anti-fragile&#39; where we not only survive difficulties, we also 
thrive and grow in chaos, uncertainty and change. </p>
<p>Being realistically robust also needs that we know when to change our 
approach and give up on banging our head against a brick wall. Sometimes it is 
more successful to be flexible and adapt to the realities on the ground. As 
humans, we have an enormous ability to adapt, and with a robust approach, we 
need to decide carefully when to persist and when to flex. </p>
<p>Robustness also helps creativity as the uncertainty of new ideas are 
entertained without judgement. It allows us to accept and drive change in our 
lives as we seek growth and development. It lets us change our understanding of 
the world around us. </p>

<h1><a name="So"></a>So what?</h1>

<p>Respect, responsibility and robustness are about being adult. In this, we may 
need to subvert the self, repress the id, and step beyond the child. They assume 
adulthood as fully entering society, becoming a functioning, contributing 
citizen. </p>
<p>The pattern of these three Rs can be seen in classic teenage angst as they 
demand respect without giving any, seek authority without responsibility, and 
still fall back into the child&#39;s position of helpless victim that pleads to be 
rescued from their wild plans gone wrong. If parents can teach the three Rs from 
an early age, perhaps their children might have an easier transition to 
functioning adulthood. </p>
<p>If you can truly adopt these three Rs, while it may make life more difficult, 
you will be admired more for your integrity and character. Paradoxically, while 
respect, reliability and robustness are not always easy to sustain, in the end 
they make life easier as other people trust you more, accept your arguments and 
sell to work with you. </p>
<p>As adults, we can reflect on how well we are living this triad of values and 
so fulfilling our position. Yes, there are other values and sets, yet respect, 
responsibility and robustness do seem to provide a solid basis for a good life.
