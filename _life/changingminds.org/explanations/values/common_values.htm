<h1>Common Values</h1>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="../explanations.htm">Explanations</a>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<a href="values.htm">Values</a> 
&gt; Common Values</p>
<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="#har">No harm</a> | <a href="#nee">
Help needy</a> | <a href="#oth">Respect others</a> | <a href="#hon">Be honest</a> 
| <a href="#mai">Maintain harmony</a> | <a href="#pun">Punish transgressors</a></p>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here are a set of common and basic social rules that appear in many 
societies. Together, they form the foundation by which people can live together. 
In particular they lead to higher levels of social <a href="../trust/trust.htm">
trust</a> and so enable people to live together and reduce both stress and 
the need to monitor others.</p>
<h2><a name="har"></a>No harm</h2>
<p class="quote"><u>Rule</u>: <i>Do not do anything that will harm or distress 
others.</i></p>
<p>People cannot live together if they are under constant threat of being hurt 
by others around them. It is a basic principle of tribes and societies where 
people can feel safe that members should not attack one another. This can be 
seen in such as the <a href="ten_commandments.htm">Ten Commandments</a> which 
says 'Thou shalt not kill'.</p>
<h3>No attack</h3>
<p>Harm can take many forms, from physical attack to unwarranted criticism. The 
greater the harm, the greater the transgression of this rule. We can and do 
criticize others, but this is usually done under the banner of punishment, as 
below.</p>
<h3>No distress</h3>
<p>Not only should you avoid direct harm to others, you should also avoid 
actions which which may lead to the distress of others. Distress is a form of 
harm, which can be mild and can also be very upsetting.</p>
<h3>No threat</h3>
<p>Threats are a form of harm as they cause distress in order to gain 
compliance. Threats can be stronger, particularly when they are extreme or made 
to vulnerable people. They may be overt and may also be more subtle. In any case people who are threatened 
often feel indignant as they know that threats are wrong.</p>
<h2><a name="nee"></a>Help needy</h2>
<p class="quote"><u>Rule</u>: <i>Help others in need, especially those who 
cannot help themselves.</i></p>
<p>Care is one of the core drivers of trust. If you show that you care about me, 
then I will be far more likely to trust you. And a key sign of care is that you 
help me. Doing no harm is passive care. Helping is active care and leads to 
greater trust.</p>
<h3>Vulnerability</h3>
<p>Social rules say that you should care for your friends and family first. They 
also make it important to help <a href="vulnerability.htm">vulnerable</a> people 
who cannot help themselves or who may be threatened by others.</p>
<h3>Getting help</h3>
<p>Helping others has an <a href="../../principles/exchange.htm">exchange</a> 
element to it, in that if I help people when they are in need, then someone will 
help me when I need it. This is not a direct exchange with one other person 
but a wider exchange with the society or group that is mandated by this general 
rule.</p>
<h2><a name="oth"></a>Respect others</h2>
<p class="quote"><u>Rule</u>: <i>Be considerate of others, respecting the 
person.</i></p>
<p>When people disrespect one another, they act with contempt, showing a lack of 
concern and care that can easily lead to distress and is unlikely to result in 
helping the needy.</p>
<p>Respect involves having a concern for others such that you believe they 
should not be unduly distressed, including by one's own arrogance and need for 
status. Paradoxically, while showing respect involves lowering one's own status 
or boosting that of others, when done well this ends up in a far greater reciprocal 
respect.</p>
<h3>Position</h3>
<p>Respect is often particularly required for those in senior positions. 
Hierarchies, whether familial or organizational, do not work without at least 
upward respect. They also work better with downward respect.</p>
<h3>Apology</h3>
<p>A way of showing respect is that when a person has been distressed, for 
whatever reason, that the perpetrator apologizes. To not apologize when you have 
done wrong is to show contempt that is typically seen as being bad (and 'bad' 
usually means values have been transgressed). </p>
<h3>Appreciation</h3>
<p>It is also respectful to show appreciation for others in the way you greet 
them, listen to them, thank them and so on. We all need our egos stroking and 
there are many rituals and rules that basically say you should be nice to people 
even when it is not strictly necessary.&nbsp; </p>
<h2><a name="hon"></a>Be honest</h2>
<p class="quote"><u>Rule</u>: <i>Tell the truth and do not deceive</i>.</p>
<p>If people in a group <a href="../behaviors/lying/lying.htm">lie</a> to one 
another or otherwise act deceptively, then this shows a lack of respect and 
damages the cohesiveness of the group. When lies are discovered,
<a href="../trust/trust.htm">trust</a> may be lost and
<a href="../trust/effects_of_betrayal.htm">betrayal</a> responses can harm 
relationships even further.</p>
<h3>Reliability</h3>
<p>When you make a promise, then honesty means you should keep that promise. 
This includes the implicit promise to follow social rules that everyone makes 
when joining or living in a group. When you are honest and reliable then others 
can predict how you will behave and so can feel safe around you.</p>
<h3>Integrity</h3>
<p>At the higher end of good values are people with strong integrity, who will 
care for others and be honest, even if they personally suffer as a result (for 
example admitting doing something wrong, even if denial or saying nothing would 
work).</p>
<h3>White lies</h3>
<p>Honesty may be tempered if the truth could distress or harm others. Where 
others will be hurt more by the truth than lies, then what we call '<a href="../behaviors/lying/white_lies.htm">white 
lies</a>' may be told.</p>
<h2><a name="mai"></a>Maintain harmony</h2>
<p><u>Rule</u>: <i>Be nice. Work to make others happy. Avoid things that would 
make others unhappy.</i></p>
<h3>Be nice</h3>
<p>Within a society, disharmony, disagreement and general unpleasantness of one 
person is experienced by many. There is hence pressure to be polite with others, 
being nice even when you feel like being nasty. </p>
<h3>Don't rock the boat</h3>
<p>When others say things that are wrong, the harmony rule motivates people to 
avoid trouble by either saying nothing or agreeing. Some persuaders use this 
rule by asserting untruths or bad ideas in a context where people are highly 
motivated to maintain harmony, and hence will agree even when they do not.</p>
<h2><a name="pun"></a>Punish transgressors</h2>

<p class="quote"><u>Rule</u>: <i>Transgressors much be punished, and everyone 
should engage in the punishment.</i></p>
<p>When a person has transgressed, acting in ways forbidden by values, then a 
core rule of social groups is that the transgressor must be punished.</p>
<h3>Social punishment</h3>
<p>Social punishment can seem simple but feel very painful and even a simple 
public criticism may damage status as the person is pushed down the social order 
in retaliation for their crimes. The worst punishment is isolation or even 
ejection. When a person has <a href="../../principles/bonding.htm">bonded</a> 
with the group, being removed feels like a part of their
<a href="../identity/identity.htm">identity</a> is being cut away.</p>
<p>A common way punishment is meted out is through gossip. Being talked about in 
negative ways by many people is not nice. Gossip also ensures everyone who needs 
to engage in punishment (which can easily be further gossiping) knows what they 
must do.&nbsp; </p>

<h3>Everyone punishes</h3>
<p>A particular aspect of social punishment rules is that, when a person is 
judged as guilty, then <i>everyone </i>should actively engage in punishing them. It is 
not enough to sit on the sidelines. Inaction means breaking this rule, which 
makes the fence-sitter guilty and now deserving of punishment.</p>
<h1><a name="So"></a>So what?</h1>

<p>Understand the common values and the impact of these on people. Beware of 
transgressing these yourself. If others have transgressed, be seen to be 
agreeing with condemnation, although it is better to be seen as a person of high integrity who cares 
about, respects and actively helps other people.</p>
<p>Social rules and transgression of these are often used in political wars, 
where character assassination is used as way of eliminating opponents. </p>
