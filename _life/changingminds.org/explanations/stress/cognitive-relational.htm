<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a common model of stress that is based around a cycle of appraisal of 
environmental stress and consequent coping. Appraisal and coping are <i>
mediating processes</i> that seek to reduce stress.</p>
<p>This is also known as the <a href="transactional_stress.htm"><i>Transactional 
Model</i></a>, <i>Lazarus Theory</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="ant"></a>Antecedents</h2>
<p>Antecedents provide input into the central appraisal activity. </p>
<h3>Stressors</h3>
<p>There are direct causes of the stress, such as a broken computer, being 
shouted at, or losing something. </p>
<p>General causes of stress include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Deprivation</i>: Not having what you want.</li>
	<li><a href="../../principles/uncertainty.htm"><i>Uncertainty</i></a>: Don't 
	know what things mean or what to do about them.</li>
	<li><i>Difficulty</i>: Unable to take effective action.</li>
	<li><i>Threat</i>: Perceived probability of harm.</li>
	<li><i>Harm</i>: Physical or psychological damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>They typically come from the external environment, although we can also 
create stress internally by imagining bad things happening.</p>
<p>Stress is an accumulative thing and many small stresses can be as bad as one 
large one. The particular combination of factors can also be significant.</p>
<h3>Other environmental factors</h3>
<p>As well as direct stressors, there are other contextual factors that may be 
significant for appraisal, for example whether other people are present.</p>
<p>Context is important for the production of meaning in any appraisal, whether 
stress-driven or not. In stress situations it can take on particular importance 
when environmental factors may exacerbate the stress or constrain coping.</p>
<h3>Person factors</h3>
<p>As well as external environmental factors, the internal human aspects of the 
person being stressed have a significant affect on the appraisal process. </p>
<p>Some people have a greater tendency towards anxiety than others (as in 
'neuroticism in the <a href="../preferences/big_five.htm">big five</a> 
personality model). This will make them more susceptible to stress. At the other 
extreme, those whose stress threshold is high actively
<a href="../preferences/risk_bias.htm">take risks</a>.</p>
<p>Another important factor is the ability of the person to cope with stressful 
situations once they occur. Again, some people are better at this than others.</p>
<p>A wide range of additional personal factors can be significant in how people 
perceive stress, such as how <a href="../preferences/extravert_introvert.htm">
extraverted or introverted</a> they are.</p>
<h2><a name="pri"></a>Primary appraisal</h2>
<p>Appraisal is the thinking stage that takes aspects from antecedents and 
identifies coping actions. It happens after stress is experienced, even though 
the person may not think of it as 'stress'. More likely it is an seen as an 
'issue', which may be defined as 'a risk that has happened'.</p>
<p>Appraisal is often considered as a single activity, but is really made up of 
two distinct components: assessment of the situation (primary appraisal) and 
identifying what to do about it (secondary appraisal). </p>
<p>In primary appraisal, people usually first appraise for short-term threat to
<a href="../needs/needs.htm">needs</a> and then for longer-term impact on 
personal and organizational <a href="../motivation/goals.htm">goals</a>. They 
may also look on the positive side, seeking opportunities and looking forward to 
challenges.</p>
<p>Key questions they may ask include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>What happened?</i> Review and clarification of actual events.</li>
	<li><i>Why did it happen?</i> Searching for causes.</li>
	<li><i>Who is to blame?</i> Is in my fault or could I point the finger 
	elsewhere?</li>
	<li><i>What will happen as a result?</i> How will it continue to impact 
	needs and goals.</li>
	<li><i>How can I benefit from this?</i> Seeking the silver lining.</li>
</ul>
<p>The results of such questions can vary significantly, depending on whether 
the person is problem-focused or is driven by self-focused emotion.</p>
<p>The inner resources people use for this analysis include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Knowledge of the situation.</li>
	<li><a href="../models/models.htm">Models</a> of how things (should) work.</li>
	<li><a href="../values/values.htm">Values</a> that tell what is good or bad.</li>
</ul>
<p>Primary appraisal may be short and internal. It may also access external 
knowledge or call on information and analysis from other people. </p>
<h2><a name="sec"></a>Secondary appraisal</h2>
<p>In secondary appraisal, the person decides what can be done to reduce the 
feelings of stress.</p>
<p>Things they choose do may depend on how familiar they are with the situation 
and the resources which they can use. These choices can be intelligent and 
effective, though they are often automatic and dysfunctional.</p>
<p>There is a kind of fight or flight option in choosing what to do. The person 
may seek to address the stressful situation, seeking to gain from it or actively 
reduce the stress. They may also feel helpless and just wallow in the stress, 
doing little to really cope.</p>
<h3>Rehearsal</h3>
<p>In deciding what to do, the person may just reactively jump to coping action. 
They may also run through possible coping strategies in their mind. Humans are 
one of the few species that can think this way and are particularly adept and 
considering complex possibilities and consequently adapting their approach.</p>
<p>This rehearsal effectively plays the whole loop, thinking of how coping 
strategies and tactics may work and then re-appraisal and revision of plans.</p>
<p>Important here (and in primary appraisal) is the sense of
<a href="../needs/control.htm">control</a>. If the person appraises the 
situation as one they can successfully handle, then their stress levels will 
reduce, which will further help them cope. In effect, rehearsal gains the 
benefits of coping even before the person puts plans into practice. General 
confidence also reduces stress, although over-confidence can cause inadequate 
coping and lead to further problems.</p>
<h2><a name="cop"></a>Coping</h2>
<p>Coping is the actual action taken to reduce the stress. This may be effective 
or ineffective. The actions here may be thought through and they may be 
unconscious reactions.</p>
<h3>Focus</h3>
<p>There are two ways people tend to focus in coping that is strongly affected 
by their personality.</p>
<p><i>Problem-focused coping </i>puts attention on the real issue and seeks to 
fix the problem and possibly prevent it from recurring.</p>
<p><i>Emotional coping </i>seeks just to reduce the stress and may be 
dysfunctional, including the use of <a href="../behaviors/coping/coping.htm">
coping mechanisms</a> and <a href="../behaviors/games/games.htm">games</a>. Such 
approaches are typical when there is little conscious appraisal.</p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>A critical aspect of how people plan to cope will depend on the resources 
available to them.</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>External resources </i>include money, power over others, access 
	control, and so on. </li>
	<li><i>Social resources </i>include the ability to call on others for help. 
	</li>
	<li><i>Internal resources </i>include resilience (picking yourself up after 
	a blow), resolve (determination to succeed) and cognitive ability 
	(intelligence and creativity, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>Resources are a key consideration during appraisal. The potential of having 
resources available can make primary appraisal more positive. The specific 
resources available will also strongly shape secondary appraisal and actual 
coping.</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>People will not always deploy all resources or take any action to reduce the 
stress as they are constrained by rules, laws, policies,
<a href="../values/values.htm">values</a> and so on. For example we are socially 
conditioned not to hit anyone, so this option is (usually) ruled out.</p>
<h2><a name="out"></a>Outcome</h2>
<p>As a result of our coping actions, there is an outcome in terms of things 
that happen and, in particular, a change in the level of stress.</p>
<p>Sometimes just taking action gives a feeling of empowerment and stress is 
reduced. Even thinking about it can help.</p>
<p>Sometimes also we are surprised at how our coping actions lead to responses 
from the environment and other people that negates our coping and may increase 
the stress on us.</p>
<h3>Benefit</h3>
<p>Outcomes are the results of action. Benefits are the positive outcomes that 
individuals and organizations experience. </p>
<p>There are also non-benefits, where nothing is gained, and dysbenefits, where 
further problems and stress is caused. A common issue happens when coping that 
is beneficial to one person causes dysbeneficial stress to others.</p>
<h3>Looping</h3>
<p>When outcomes give us feedback on our coping actions we re-appraise the 
situation and, if necessary, try something else. In this way coping is a 
continuous process. The environment around us is constantly changing and what 
may have worked may not now be that effective.</p>
<h2><a name="dis"></a>Discussion</h2>
<p>This is a 'Feel-Think-Do' model, where the person feels stress, thinks about 
it (appraisal) and then acts. </p>
<h3>Complexity</h3>
<p>As indicated above, stress management is not a simple sense-and-respond 
system but an ongoing <a href="transactional_stress.htm">transactional</a> 
process.</p>
<p>The environment keeps changing and unfolding, throwing new stressors at us 
and preventing us from effectively resolving every stress as it occurs.</p>
<h3>Assumptions</h3>

<p>There are three meta-theoretical assumptions in this model: </p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Transaction</i>: The person and the environment exert reciprocal 
	influences on each other.</li>
	<li><i>Process</i>: Emotions and thoughts change continuously.</li>
	<li><i>Context</i>: The meaning given to stress is dependent on the 
	environmental context (as in any human cognition).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Internal-external</h3>
<p>There is an ongoing theme through this model of things internal to the person 
and external in their actions and contextual events. </p>
<p>While there is always both internal and external activity, people may bias 
this, for example by consciously analyzing the environment and taking deliberate 
action, as opposed to just feeling stressed and reacting habitually. </p>
<h3>Positive-negative</h3>
<p>There can also be a focus on the positive, for example seeking opportunity 
during appraisal, rather than the more usual negative view of stress as a 
problem or irritant. When many avoid or seek to reduce stress, others see it as 
a chance to grow or otherwise find advantage. While they may not always succeed 
in this, the optimistic outlook reduces stress and may lead to real benefits.
</p>
<h1><a name="So"></a>So what?</h1>
<p>Use this model to assess both stressful events and how people respond to 
them. Seek out how they appraise the situation and decide on coping actions.</p>
<p>Stress is a form of <a href="../../principles/tension.htm">tension</a>, which 
is central to persuasion. This means you can utilize this model during 
persuasion, for example in creating stressors or guiding the person through the 
appraisal and coping.</p>
<p>You can also use an understanding of this to help them, for example in 
showing how they appraise and cope, and how there are more effective ways of 
doing this.</p>
