<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p>We spend a lot of time at work, where we may find great fulfilment and 
meaning in our lives. Unfortunately, many of us are more likely to find it a 
place of stress and discomfort. Here are a number of factors that are likely to 
increase the stress a person may feel at work. </p>
<h2><a name="un"></a>Unpleasant environment</h2>
<p>Many modern offices and workplaces are rather pleasant, with air 
conditioning, ergonomic seating, coffee, plants and so on. But it was not always 
like this and is still not all like this.</p>
<p>Environments which are hazardous put us always on our guard, watching for 
things that may fall, toxic leaks, dangerous machinery and so on. Even simple 
things like dirty toilets make us uncomfortable and fearful for our health.</p>
<p>If you are faced with such a workplace, other than working to make the whole 
place safer, you can focus on your particular area, tidying up, cleaning and 
making things generally healthier.</p>
<h2><a name="con"></a>Lack of control</h2>
<p>We have a deep need for a sense of <a href="../needs/control.htm">control</a> 
and losing or reducing this leads to uncertainty and stress.</p>
<p>Some jobs are very precise and straightforward and the person has a lot of 
control over what they are doing, whether it is sweeping the floor or 
programming a computer. In such deterministic environments, the person is in 
control and if there are any problems there is little that is stopping them.</p>
<h3>Complexity</h3>
<p>Having said this, there are limitation to human ability and as the job gets 
more complex the person may find it more and more difficult to sustain control. 
In this way a computer programmer, although they know that computers obey all 
instructions, may be unable to produce perfect programs simply because of the 
complexity of the situation. </p>
<h3>Random forces</h3>
<p>A bigger problem is when random forces are at play, for example the variation 
in weather that farmers face and which can add significantly to the uncertainty 
and stress the farmer faces.</p>
<h3>Autonomous agents</h3>
<p>Another form of complexity that reduces control is in social situations where 
other people may have opposing goals or intent. Even if they work for you, they 
are not totally under your control. On the other hand, when you work for others, 
you have even less control over them, which can be very stressful.</p>
<p>When you have a lack of control, seek to find out exactly the major issues 
and their causes, then find ways to improve the situation by addressing these.
</p>
<h2><a name="res"></a>Responsibility without authority</h2>
<p>This is a particularly common variant of insufficient of control, where you 
are given work that must be done but you do not have the authority to command 
others to help you and do those things that are needed in order to complete 
those things for which you are responsible. This is increasingly common in jobs 
which are collaborative and cross team and organisational boundaries. </p>
<p>In a knowledge organisation, where many are educated to degree level and 
beyond, you are expected to 'get things done' without having the 'old fashioned' 
management command-and-control approaches. Managing change is an extreme form of 
this, where the change manager has to influence people who may well be opposed 
to the change, for quite understandable reasons.</p>
<p>Responsibility without authority is a particular case where persuasion and 
influence is important. Where you have responsibility but no authority, the best 
way of counteracting this to develop skill in these areas.</p>
<h2><a name="job"></a>No job satisfaction</h2>
<p>Enjoying one's work can lead to a great sense of
<a href="../emotions/pride.htm">pride</a> and satisfaction and give
<a href="../meaning/meaning.htm">meaning</a> to our lives, which is something we 
all seek. Unfortunately, many of us gain little satisfaction from what we do at 
work. It is just a job that gives us money to pay the bills. Worse, we may be 
dissatisfied and unhappy when the job ends up with us feeling a negative 
meaning, that our lives are being wasted or spend in doing bad things.</p>
<p>Work becomes more meaningful when we understand its meaning. If you can link 
your actions to the success of the organisation then it is easier to find 
satisfaction. But when you just feel like a small cog in a big engine that is 
being spun from above for unknown reasons, then your job satisfaction will go 
down. Worse, if you can see you are disconnected from the main work without the 
possibility of contributing any value, then you may feel distinct 
dissatisfaction with your job. </p>
<p>A good way to help with job satisfaction is first, when looking for a job, to 
seek work that you can find meaningful. If you are already in a job, try to 
understand how it is contributing to the company and to society. You can also 
focus on the small things, recognizing that even a five-minute task is an 
essential part of the whole. Great machines do not function without their small 
cogs.</p>
<h2><a name="tim"></a>Not enough time</h2>
<p>We all want to do a good job, but when time is literally money (we are paid 
for the time we are there), there is always pressure to deliver within a time 
boundary rather than take time to do the job well.</p>
<p>The result is that we get the dual stress of both hurrying to meet deadlines 
and the realization that our work is not of high quality. When we are prevented 
from doing our best, we feel frustrated. When we make mistakes, typically from 
hurrying, we feel incompetent and worry about the impact of being found out.</p>
<p>When faced with time pressures, you can help by looking to understand time 
management and applying some of the methods, such as planning ahead and sticking 
to your priority list. If you can say no, then this is a powerful method. If you 
cannot say no, then bounce decision back up to your boss, asking what your 
priorities should be.</p>
<h2><a name="fee"></a>No feedback</h2>
<p>It is not always easy to know that we are adding value to an organisation, 
even if we think we are. If we get feedback to indicate that we are helping out, 
then helps us create <a href="../meaning/meaning.htm">meaning</a> in our lives. 
Praise also strokes the ego, boosting our sense of
<a href="../needs/identity.htm">identity</a>.</p>
<p>For its best effect, praise has to be specific, saying what we are doing 
right. General praise is nice for the ego but does not help us keep doing the 
right things. </p>
<p>Feedback that tells us we are doing things wrong is also important, as it 
gives us control in being able to correct the situation. It is certainly better 
than no feedback. The trick with giving corrective feedback is in helping the 
person accept and act on it, rather than take it as personal slight and attack 
back.</p>
<h2><a name="conf"></a>Conflict</h2>
<p>In the ideal organization, everyone has objectives which aligns with everyone 
else, with no overlap or conflict. Also everyone would have the same values and 
beliefs in keeping a focus on the higher goal such that they are always 
motivated to cooperate.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there can be many reasons for interpersonal conflict at work. 
A common one is where one person needs another person to do something by a 
certain time, but the second person has no motivation to do so and may well be 
strongly motivated in another direction. The result is conflict, either verbally 
overt or subtle and pernicious.</p>
<p>Conflict can trigger the <a href="../brain/fight_flight.htm">fight-or-flight 
reaction</a>, with attendant body chemical changes that create immediate stress, 
including that caused by us having to exercise
<a href="../../techniques/willpower/self-control.htm">self-control</a> in 
holding back our animal instincts to lash out in return.</p>
<p>We also conflict with others based on our <a href="../values/values.htm">
values</a>, deciding what is right and wrong and judging them as good or bad. 
This is a dangerous zone as the subsequent dislike can go far beyond the short 
term original cause.</p>
<p>When conflict arises, <a href="../power/power.htm">power</a> become more 
important. People with the vested power of position may manipulate their 
resources to get what they want, even when it seriously disadvantages others. 
Others may turn to subtlety and subterfuge, quietly sabotaging and anonymously 
causing mayhem. </p>
<p>If you are caught up in conflict at work, do avoid getting dragged into
<a href="../behaviors/games/mintzberg_game.htm">political games</a>. Instead 
seek to understand with the other person, building
<a href="../../techniques/conversation/rapport/rapport.htm">rapport</a> and 
hence developing the power to influence them in a collaborative way.</p>
<h2><a name="har"></a>Harassment</h2>
<p>Although there are laws against it in many countries, there is still much 
oppression with in the workplace, often by managers who have a strong task focus 
and who consider directive command a necessity and who substitute people skills 
with sledge-hammer coercion.</p>
<p><a href="../theories/stereotypes.htm">Stereotypes</a> are also still alive 
and well and women and people from minority groups can easily find themselves 
being victimized or otherwise on the receiving end of unkind bias. It is such 
situations that have led to legislation about equality and, if you face such 
bias, you may need to invoke. </p>
<p>An unconscious trap can happen where we subtly accept the bias of stereotypes 
applied to us and, without knowing it, give way to others or otherwise put 
ourselves at a disadvantage. In such ways women start acting like men in 
androcentric workplaces and people with darker skins do not bother applying for 
more senior roles.</p>
<p>A good first step when you are affected by harassment or victimization of any 
kind is to ask the offender if they know what they are doing and the effect they 
are having. A surprising number will apologize and change. For others, you may 
need to get advice from HR or Trade Unions. In any case, do try to avoid getting 
into a retributive situation where your only choice is vengeance. It is far 
better to correct the problem than just punish it.&nbsp; </p>

<h2><a name="cul"></a>Cultural mismatch</h2>
<p>Every organization has its own <a href="../culture/culture.htm">culture</a>. 
This includes a mixture of beliefs, values and models that shape how people 
behave and how they assume others will behave. Culture tells you what is right 
and wrong, what should and should not be done. </p>
<p>We also have personal beliefs, values and models, which is in effect our 
personal culture that has been built from the cultures within family, friends 
and former employers. It is hence not surprising that when a person first joins 
an organization (or even moves team within an organization) they easily feel out 
of sorts and in disagreement with a number of the cultural elements they find. 
This can lead to inner dissonance and outer conflict with others, each with 
attendant stress and discomfort.</p>
<p>If you find yourself in cultural conflict, you have several choices. First, 
you can hold your ground and fight for what you believe is right. This is 
unlikely to be successful and will lead to high stress. Alternatively, you can 
adopt the new culture, giving up your old beliefs and accepting new truths. If 
this is too difficult, you can 'bite the bullet' and quietly accept that the way 
things work here are not your ideal, but your need for employment overrides your 
need for moral agreement. Finally, you can leave. </p>
<h2><a name="wor"></a>Work-life balance</h2>
<p>Another source of stress is where people spend so much time at work they find 
they are neglecting their home life to the detriment of their family and 
friends. This can be a paradox as family and friends often are more important, 
yet the need to earn a living and build a meaningful career somehow takes 
precedence.</p>
<p>Some companies expect you to work long hours. If you find this abhorrent, 
then you have a mismatch and the best answer is to leave (preferably finding an 
alternative job first). Other companies consider getting your work-life balance 
out of kilter to be a symptom of a workaholic or disorganized person.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that if you find your work-life balance is not what you 
want, then you need either to manage your time more effectively or find a job 
where you will be allowed to do this.</p>
<h2><a name="thr"></a>Threat of job loss</h2>
<p>If you live constantly under the threat of losing your job, then this will 
add quite a powerful layer of stress. Without a regular income, many would 
financially sink, losing their accommodation and perhaps ending up on the 
streets.</p>
<p>Some jobs have a greater probability of job loss. A common such example is 
sales, where there are many roles where missing target sales can result in a 
sales person being fired. The effect can happen at all levels in the 
organisation. At the bottom, simple manual jobs can easily be replace or 
outsourced. Even at the top, CEO tenure has been decreasing steadily over a 
number of years. If you do not make the numbers or someone else can do it for 
less, then you are out.</p>
<p>There are two strategies to keeping your job. First, whatever you do, do it 
well. Certainly better than most of those around you, so if somebody has to go, 
it is not you. The other strategy is, if a regular income is critical, to take 
jobs that are more secure (although of course 'jobs for life' is now very much a 
thing of the past).</p>
<h2><a name="cha"></a>Change</h2>
<p><a href="../../disciplines/change_management/change_management.htm">Change</a> 
in the workplace can be both threatening and wearisome. Few organizations can 
stand still these days and constant change can be highly stressful, especially 
if there is a threat each time of being fired just because your skills are no 
longer needed. </p>
<p>Change also impacts needs for a sense of <a href="../needs/control.htm">
control</a> and a sense of <a href="../needs/identity.htm">identity</a> as the 
ground beneath you and team structure is constantly shifting. Change can be 
particularly threatening for successful people, who have succeeded in the former 
structure but who may be disadvantaged by the changes. This can make things 
difficult for the change agents as powerful people defend their hard-won 
empires.</p>
<p>If you are faced with organizational change, the best approach is often to go 
along with it rather than fight back. Seek to understand the real purpose then 
use this in subtle influence that both helps the change and also helps you.</p>
<h2><a name="rep"></a>Suppression</h2>
<p>In many workplaces the culture still is such that honest opinions cannot be 
expressed. Personal opinion, creativity and certainly criticism of managers is 
not welcome, even if the ideas expressed could save or make the company 
millions.</p>
<p>This principle derives from management theory from a hundred years ago, a 
surprising amount of which is still around. Managers do the thinkers and workers 
do the doing. Whilst many companies are much better than they once were, there 
are still plenty of managers who really do not like their carefully laid plans 
being interrupted, even if they are going off the rails.</p>
<p>A common pattern is a focus on positivity and good news. Based on the idea 
that a positive approach will bring success, bad news is positively ignored and 
the bringers of bad news are vilified as nay-sayers who will destroy morale.</p>
<p>When you cannot say what is concerning you, you have to bottle it up. The 
result is an organization full of repressed people, who may well know that the 
whole company is going down the tubes but who dare not say anything. This is the 
principle of <a href="../theories/groupthink.htm">Groupthink</a>, where team 
harmony is prioritized over challenge, even to the point of destruction.</p>
<h1><a name="So"></a>So what?</h1>
<p>Understand the stressors at work and do something about those which impact 
you the most. Do not sit there and do nothing otherwise your performance will be 
impacted, which will just increase the stress even further.</p>
