<p class="smaller" align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Much attention is paid to negative emotions and it often seems that there are 
relatively few positive emotions, yet this can be as much about attention and 
experience that anything. Psychology has also tended in the past to the medical 
view of fixing problems rather than the positive side of life. Positive emotion 
may be considered as any feeling where there is a lack of negativity, such that 
no pain or discomfort is felt.</p>
<p>Frederickson (2009) identifies the ten most common positive emotions as <i>
joy, gratitude, serenity, interest, hope, pride, amusement, inspiration, awe </i>
and<i> love</i>. She also noted that we really need a 3:1 ratio of positive to negative in 
order to have a good life. </p>
<p>There are also other positive emotions we can consider, for example the 
emotion felt when helping others (this does not seem to have a clear word so is 
called <i>altruism</i> 
here). In addition, <i>satisfaction</i> and <i>relief</i> are discussed.</p>
<p>Here is a brief discussion on each of these.</p>
<h2><a name="joy"></a>Joy</h2>
<p>'Joy' is a common term that is used to describe the spectrum of
<a href="happiness/happiness.htm">happiness</a>, from gentle comfort to ecstatic 
bliss. As a positive emotion, it is probably the most common one to be 
identified and also the one that is most commonly sought. Joy is often 
short-term, appearing quickly and also fading fast. Overall happiness can be 
increased by finding more things to be joyful about.</p>
<p>Joy can be found in many of the other positive emotions, all of which are 
linked to 'being happy', yet it is useful to separate them out for individual 
consideration.</p>
<h2><a name="gra"></a>Gratitude</h2>
<p><a href="../../techniques/happiness/expressing_gratitude.htm">Gratitude</a> 
is one of the strongest correlates with happiness. Simply by being grateful for 
what you have, you are focusing on the positive, as opposed to being unhappy 
about what you do not have. Expressing gratitude multiplies this as it not only 
reinforces the internal positive attitude but it both gains the altruistic 
pleasure of helping others and may be reflected in their 'gratitude for 
gratitude' and how they seek to make you happy in future.</p>
<h2><a name="ser"></a>Serenity</h2>
<p>Serenity is the calm of being content with what you have. It is an
<a href="happiness/epicurean_pleasure.htm">Epicurean pleasure</a> in the way 
Epicurus defined pleasure as the absence of pain. Serenity is linked with higher 
spiritual states where the person feels at one with the universe and neither a 
victim nor a beneficiary of fate.</p>
<h2><a name="int"></a>Interest</h2>
<p>We have <a href="../motivation/interest.htm">interest</a> in those things 
that will help us to meet <a href="../needs/needs.htm">needs</a> and achieve our
<a href="../motivation/goals.htm">goals</a>. Interest is also sparked by
<a href="../needs/novelty.htm">novelty</a> which piques our
<a href="../needs/curiosity.htm">curiosity</a> and so creates
<a href="../motivation/inquiry_arousal.htm">inquiry arousal</a>. Just taking an 
interest in what is going on around you and in the world at large gives space 
for the pleasure of discovery to appear. </p>
<h2><a name="hop"></a>Hope</h2>
<p><a href="hope.htm">Hope</a> is anticipatory happiness. It is the pleasure of 
an assumed future where good things happen and you will experience joy or other 
positive emotions. Hope is associated with optimism and our natural bias towards 
this can bring happiness into an unhappy situation as we think about how things 
can only get better. </p>
<h2><a name="pri"></a>Pride</h2>
<p><a href="pride.htm">Pride</a> can have both negative and positive sides. A 
prideful person is arrogant and concerned with their
<a href="../needs/status.htm">status</a> over others. They may feel 
happy, but at the expense of others. The more positive form of pride is typified 
by the 
pride in one's work or one's team. It is a 'purer' form of pride as it is 
intrinsically felt and is not negative about other people.</p>
<h2><a name="amu"></a>Amusement</h2>
<p>Amusement happens when we find something funny, from jokes to the incongruous 
nature of the world around us. <a href="../../techniques/humor/using_humor.htm">
Humor</a> is an easy way of connecting with others and a shared sense of 
amusement is a helpful social bond. Being easily amused is also not to take 
things too seriously, especially ourselves. If you can laugh at your own 
mistakes then you can be happy forever.</p>
<h2><a name="ins"></a>Inspiration</h2>
<p>Inspiration is what we feel when we see consummate skill or hear a great 
speech, and are inspired to do something as a result of this. In this way, 
inspiration is a strong motivational force and can be very powerful for changing 
minds. <a href="../../disciplines/leadership/leadership.htm">Leaders</a> in 
particular will use this, particularly when using
<a href="../../disciplines/leadership/styles/charismatic_leadership.htm">
charismatic</a> and
<a href="../../disciplines/leadership/styles/transformational_leadership.htm">
transformational</a> styles of leadership.</p>
<h2><a name="awe"></a>Awe</h2>
<p>Awe is the feeling you get when you see a wonderful sunset or landscape. It 
is what you feel when you experience great art and marvel at the skill of the 
artist. This can be achieved through appreciation of painting, performance or 
some other creative expression. Awe can also be spiritual as you wonder at the 
marvels of the infinite universe or the totality of your god. Awe can come just 
from openness to experience. When you think of the wonders around you and even within you, you 
can just feel in awe of it all.</p>
<h2><a name="lov"></a>Love</h2>
<p><a href="../theories/love.htm">Love</a> is a hugely powerful emotion which we 
first experience as an infant from our parents or carers. It is also complex and 
there are several forms that may or may not seek reciprocation. The purest form 
is unconditional love, seeking to give but not to receive (romantic love seeks 
both to give and to get affection). </p>
<h2><a name="alt"></a>Altruism</h2>
<p>Altruism is the pleasure of
<a href="../../techniques/happiness/devoted_service.htm">helping other people</a>. 
It is related to love but is not quite the same, although it can be seen as 
being based on the love of humanity. Helping people, even strangers, is a very 
powerful method for gaining happiness and has strong social value as well as 
proving us as 'higher beings' who are not solely driven by selfish motivations.</p>
<h2><a name="sat"></a>Satisfaction</h2>
<p>Satisfaction is the pleasure of meeting
<a href="../../techniques/happiness/achievable_challenge.htm">challenges</a> and 
achieving <a href="../motivation/goals.htm">goals</a>. It is related both to 
pride and serenity and is a low-activation emotion (in contrast to states of 
higher arousal such as inspiration). The opposite of satisfaction is 
dissatisfaction and the <a href="../trust/effects_of_betrayal.htm">betrayal</a> 
impact of this is known by many companies who have not satisfied their 
customers.</p>
<h2><a name="rel"></a>Relief</h2>
<p>When we feel threatened, then we feel relief when the threat is avoided as we 
'dodge the bullet'. We also feel relief when we are feeling uncomfortable about 
something, from being ill to revising for exams, and the uncomfortable period 
finishes. We sometimes talk about a 'blessed relief', which reflects the 
positive feeling as we <a href="../../principles/contrast.htm">contrast</a> the 
comfort now with the recent discomfort.</p>
<h1><a name="So"></a>So what?</h1>

<p>Persuasion can be based both in negative such as <a href="fear.htm">fear</a>, 
neutral ones such as <a href="surprise.htm">surprise</a> and also avaricious
<a href="desire.htm">desire</a>. However perhaps the most effective emotions are 
the positive ones. If you can offer happiness as a reward then it is more 
effective than the sadness that is suggested by fear motivators.</p>
