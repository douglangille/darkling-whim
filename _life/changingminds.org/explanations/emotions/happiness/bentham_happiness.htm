<p class="smaller" align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jeremy Bentham was the founder of
<a href="../../research/philosophies/utilitarianism.htm">Utilitarianism</a>, 
where the fundamental axiom is that it is the greatest happiness of the greatest 
number of people that should be the basis for all decisions.</p>
<p>He defined fourteen pleasures that we all seek and which precipitate 
happiness.</p>
<h2><a name="sen"></a>1. The pleasures of sense</h2>
<p><a href="../../needs/stimulation.htm">Stimulating</a> the senses in many ways 
creates <a href="../../needs/arousal.htm">arousal</a>, which can often be 
pleasurable. </p>
<p>Bentham describes these as:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p class="quote"><i>The pleasures of the taste or palate; including whatever 
	pleasures are experienced in satisfying the appetites of hunger and thirst.
	</i></p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="quote"><i>The pleasure of intoxication. </i></p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="quote"><i>The pleasures of the organ of smelling. </i></p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="quote"><i>The pleasures of the touch. </i></p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="quote"><i>The simple pleasures of the ear; independent of 
	association. </i></p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="quote"><i>The simple pleasures of the eye; independent of 
	association. </i></p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="quote"><i>The pleasure of the sexual sense. </i></p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="quote"><i>The pleasure of health: or, the internal pleasureable 
	feeling or flow of spirits (as it is called), which accompanies a state of 
	full health and vigour; especially at times of moderate bodily exertion. </i>
	</p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="quote"><i>The pleasures of novelty: or, the pleasures derived from 
	the gratification of the appetite of curiosity, by the application of new 
	objects to any of the senses.</i></p></li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="wea"></a>2. The pleasures of wealth</h2>
<p>With money, you have <a href="../../needs/control.htm">control</a> and
<a href="../../needs/status.htm">status</a> which, as basic needs, can 
lead to greater happiness.</p>
<p>Bentham describes the pleasures of wealth as those which:</p>
<p class="quote"><i>...a man is apt to derive from the consciousness of 
possessing any article or articles which stand in the list of instruments of 
enjoyment or security, and more particularly at the time of his first acquiring 
them; at which time the pleasure may be styled a pleasure of gain or a pleasure 
of acquisition: at other times a pleasure of possession.</i></p>
<h2><a name="ski"></a>3. The pleasures of skill</h2>
<p>There is a joy in simply being able to do something, whether it is an 
intellectual exercise or physical action. When we meet our goals, we get a sense 
of <a href="../../../techniques/happiness/achievable_challenge.htm">achievement</a> 
and a secure knowledge that we are in <a href="../../needs/control.htm">control</a>.</p>
<p>On this subject, Bentham said:</p>
<p class="quote"><i>The pleasures of skill, as exercised upon particular 
objects, are those which accompany the application of such particular 
instruments of enjoyment to their uses, as cannot be so applied without a 
greater or less share of difficulty or exertion.</i></p>
<h2><a name="ami"></a>4. The pleasures of amity</h2>
<p>Friendship is a classic route to happiness and those with good friends (and 
who <i>are </i>good friends) can expect to have a longer, more fulfilling life.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Bentham described this as follows: </p>
<p class="quote"><i>The pleasures of amity, or self-recommendation, are the 
pleasures that may accompany the persuasion of a man's being in the acquisition 
or the possession of the good-will of such or such assignable person or persons 
in particular: or, as the phrase is, of being upon good terms with him or them: 
and as a fruit of it, of his being in a way to have the benefit of their 
spontaneous and gratuitous services. </i></p>
<h2><a name="goo"></a>5. The pleasures of a good name</h2>
<p>One's <a href="../../../techniques/conversation/name/name.htm">name</a> is 
one's <a href="../../../disciplines/brand_management/brand_management.htm">brand</a>. 
Who you are socially is, in many ways, who you really are. If you have a good 
reputation as a person then you effectively are in credit with significant 
social capital, which in turn allows you to ask things of others and expect 
people to help you without prompting. </p>
<p>Bentham described the pleasures of a good name as that which:</p>
<p class="quote"><i>...accompany the persuasion of a man's being in the 
acquisition or the possession of the good-will of the world about him; that is, 
of such members of society as he is likely to have concerns with; and as a means 
of it, either their love or their esteem, or both: and as a fruit of it, of his 
being in the way to have the benefit of their spontaneous and gratuitous 
services. These may likewise be called the pleasures of good repute, the 
pleasures of honour, or the pleasures of the moral sanction. </i></p>
<h2><a name="pow"></a>6. The pleasures of power</h2>
<p><a href="../../power/power.htm">Power</a> gives one the ability to influence 
others and is a key contributor to one's sense of
<a href="../../needs/control.htm">control</a>.</p>
<p>Bentham noted the pain-pleasure aspect of power, describing the pleasures as 
those that that accompany:</p>
<p class="quote">...<i>the persuasion of a man's being in a condition to dispose 
people, by means of their hopes and fears, to give him the benefit of their 
services: that is, by the hope of some service, or by the fear of some 
disservice, that he may be in the way to render them </i></p>
<h2><a name="pie"></a>7. The pleasures of piety</h2>
<p>Almost in contrast to power, piety is about being reverent and dutiful, 
including to family, state and church. Social <a href="../../values/values.htm">
values</a> describe what 'good' is and complying to these rules can make you 
feel good, particularly in contrast to those wicked people who do not follow the 
rules as well as you.</p>
<p>Bentham said:</p>
<p class="quote"><i>The pleasures of piety are the pleasures that accompany the 
belief of a man's being in the acquisition or in possession of the good-will or 
favour of the Supreme Being: and as a fruit of it, of his being in a way of 
enjoying pleasures to be received by God's special appointment, either in this 
life, or in a life to come. These may also be called the pleasures of religion, 
the pleasures of a religious disposition, or the pleasures of the religious 
sanction. </i></p>
<h2><a name="ben"></a>8. The pleasures of benevolence</h2>
<p>When you have <a href="../../power/power.htm">power</a> in the form of 
resources you can use to whatever end you choose, you can find happiness in
<a href="../../../techniques/happiness/devoted_service.htm">service</a> to 
others, helping those who are less able to help themselves.</p>
<p>Bentham described these as:</p>
<p class="quote"><i>...the pleasures resulting from the view of any pleasures 
supposed to be possessed by the beings who may be the objects of benevolence; to 
wit, the sensitive beings we are acquainted with; under which are commonly 
included, 1. The Supreme Being. 2. Human beings. 3. Other animals. These may 
also be called the pleasures of good-will, the pleasures of sympathy, or the 
pleasures of the benevolent or social affections.</i></p>
<h2><a name="mal"></a>9. The pleasures of malevolence</h2>
<p>In contrast to&nbsp; benevolence, power may be used to harm others and it is 
a sad indictment of the human condition that we can find pleasure in the 
discomfort of others (what the Germans call 'Schadenfreude'). If we are honest, 
most of us have wished ill of others and have also done things to hurt them. </p>
<p>Bentham said that the pleasures of malevolence come from:</p>
<p class="quote"><i>...the view of any pain supposed to be suffered by the 
beings who may become the objects of malevolence: to wit, 1. Human beings. 2. 
Other animals. These may also be styled the pleasures of ill-will, the pleasures 
of the irascible appetite, the pleasures of antipathy, or the pleasures of the 
malevolent or dissocial affections </i></p>
<h2><a name="mem"></a>10. The pleasures of memory</h2>
<p>Having a good <a href="../../../techniques/memory/memory.htm">memory</a> can 
be a blessing for many reasons. At least there is the utility in being able to 
remember things learned. In addition, past pleasures can be recalled and one is 
able to indulge in nostalgic enjoyment.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Bentham described these as:</p>
<p class="quote"><i>...the pleasures which, after having enjoyed such and such 
pleasures, or even in some case after having suffered such and such pains, a man 
will now and then experience, at recollecting them exactly in the order and in 
the circumstances in which they were actually enjoyed or suffered. These 
derivative pleasures may of course be distinguished into as many species as 
there are of original perceptions, from whence they may be copied. They may also 
be styled pleasures of simple recollection. </i></p>
<h2><a name="ima"></a>11. The pleasures of imagination</h2>
<p>The human imagination is remarkable in its ability to create a virtual 
reality that, in extreme, is more real than the real world. At the very least 
imagination lets you indulge in fantasies. It may also help you dream up futures 
that you can practically implement.</p>
<p>Bentham described the pleasures of the imagination as:</p>
<p class="quote"><i>...the pleasures which may be derived from the contemplation 
of any such pleasures as may happen to be suggested by the memory, but in a 
different order, and accompanied by different groups of circumstances. These may 
accordingly be referred to any one of the three cardinal points of time, 
present, past, or future. It is evident they may admit of as many distinctions 
as those of the former class. </i></p>
<h2><a name="exp"></a>12. The pleasures of expectation</h2>
<p>Imagination helps you to think about the future and create expectations for 
pleasures to come. This anticipated pleasure can be as good, if not better, than 
the enjoyment of things happening.</p>
<p>Bentham described these as:</p>
<p class="quote"><i>...the pleasures that result from the contemplation of any 
sort of pleasure, referred to time future, and accompanied with the sentiment of 
belief. These also may admit of the same distinctions</i></p>
<h2><a name="ass"></a>13. The pleasures dependent on association</h2>
<p>The human brain works by linking neurons into thoughts and dreams that can 
lead to pleasant reveries. In daydreaming, for example, we wonder about what may 
be and may come up with associated ideas that are further benefit to us.</p>
<p>Bentham explains:</p>
<p class="quote"><i>...pleasures of association are the pleasures which certain 
objects or incidents may happen to afford, not of themselves, but merely in 
virtue of some association they have contracted in the mind with certain objects 
or incidents which are in themselves pleasurable. Such is the case, for 
instance, with the pleasure of skill, when afforded by such a set of incidents 
as compose a game of chess. This derives its pleasurable quality from its 
association partly with the pleasures of skill, as exercised in the production 
of incidents pleasurable of themselves: partly from its association with the 
pleasures of power. Such is the case also with the pleasure of good luck, when 
afforded by such incidents as compose the game of hazard, or any other game of 
chance, when played at for nothing. This derives its pleasurable quality from 
its association with one of the pleasures of wealth; to wit, with the pleasure 
of acquiring it </i></p>
<h2><a name="rel"></a>14. The pleasures of relief</h2>
<p>Relief is a form of <a href="../../../principles/closure.htm">closure</a> 
where an expected unpleasant event does not happen. In such cases, the lack of 
unpleasantness is experienced as pleasantness in itself.</p>
<p>Bentham's comment on this is:</p>
<p class="quote"><i>To the catalogue of pleasures may accordingly be added the 
pleasures of relief: or, the pleasures which a man experiences when, after he 
has been enduring a pain of any kind for a certain time, it comes to cease, or 
to abate. These may of course be distinguished into as many species as there are 
of pains: and may give rise to so many pleasures of memory, of imagination, and 
of expectation.</i></p>

<h1><a name="So"></a>So what?</h1>

<p>Bentham was a very perceptive philosopher who produced an interesting list of 
pleasures that you can consider when seeking to persuade. If you can offer to 
increase pleasure (or threaten to reduce it), then this may be sufficient for 
you to gain agreement.</p>
