<h1>Type of Fear</h1>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="../explanations.htm">Explanations</a>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<a href="emotions.htm">Emotions</a> 
&gt; Type of Fear</p>

<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="#pai">Fear of pain</a> |
<a href="#loss">Fear of loss</a> | <a href="#non">Fear of non-gain</a> | 
<a href="#ext">Fear of extinction</a> | <a href="#los">Fear of uncertainty</a> | <a href="#fai">Fear 
of failure</a> | <a href="#con">Conditioned fear</a> | <a href="#So">So
what</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="fear.htm">Fear</a> is a deep <a href="../motivation/motivation.htm">
motivator</a>, which makes it important to understand when changing minds. For example, fear of change 
can stop people from listening to you, so you should understand and address that 
fear at an early stage. </p>
<h2><a name="pai"></a>Fear of pain </h2>
<p>Pain hurts and extreme pain is excruciating. Pain is designed to protect the 
body by making us take care of physical damage to ourselves. This can become 
unhelpful when we have got the message yet the pain continues. We might also 
consider that high levels of pain are unnecessary. </p>
<p>Pain can be psychological as well as physical. Psychological pain is often 
felt in the body as tension and stress, and can be every bit as unbearable as 
that caused by physical damage to the body. Most fear is felt this way, which is 
why we may fear fear itself.</p>
<h2><a name="loss"></a>Fear of loss </h2>
<p>We acquire many things in our lives, often as a result of long and hard work. 
This includes physical objects and intangible things such as relationships. The 
thought of losing what we have gained is often a fearful thought (that has led 
to a profitable insurance industry). </p>
<p>The sense of loss is preceded by the process of attachment, in which we 
connect things and people to our sense of <a href="../identity/identity.htm">
identity</a>, making them an extension of 
our selves. Loss then becomes a loss of self, which relates to the fear of 
extinction. </p>
<p>When attachment is stronger, the anticipated sense of loss is also greater, 
which in turn amplifies fear. This is why the thought of losing family and 
friends can be so scary. It also explains why there are philosophies that 
propose a reduction in material wealth and even living as a hermit.</p>
<h2><a name="non"></a>Fear of non-gain </h2>
<p>The flip-side of losing what you have is to not gain what want and expect. 
When we <a href="../needs/prediction.htm">predict</a> the future (which we constantly do), some things are 
particularly desirable, in particular those related to achieving our 
<a href="../motivation/goals.htm">goals</a>. The 
thought of not gaining the things we have planned to gain is painful and makes 
us fearful. </p>
<p>Achieving our goals is affected by our ability to control the world around 
us. If we cannot achieve this then we may rightly feel threatened by it, and 
consequently fearful of it.</p>
<p>Fear of non-gain can be driven by anticipated loss, where we imaging gaining 
what we desire and then feel a sense of loss when we think about not getting it.
</p>
<h2><a name="ext"></a>Fear of extinction </h2>
<p>Our sense of <a href="../identity/identity.htm">identity</a> is a fundamental need and is closely associated with 
our sense of meaning and self-worth. When things happen to reduce this sense we 
feel diminished and our sense of personal meaning in the world is damaged. </p>
<p>The opposite position to identity is actual or perceived personal 
extinction, either of which is terrifying. It is perhaps unsurprising that many 
religions have a focus in continuation of the self after death. It is this fear 
of extinction that is the ultimate concern when our identity is threatened.</p>
<p>Fear of rejection by others is very common. We extend our sense of identity 
to include those around us. When others reject us, our extended sense of 
identity is damaged and can trigger the empty feeling of loneliness.</p>
<h2><a name="los"></a>Fear of uncertainty </h2>
<p>In the <a href="../needs/cia.htm">The CIA Needs Model</a> there are two key needs: for a sense of 
<a href="../needs/identity.htm">identity</a> and 
for a sense of <a href="../needs/control.htm">control</a>. As well as the fear of 
extinction (loss of identity) we may also fear 
losing control, which is affected by uncertainty. This fear is often about the possibility of 
the non-gain of not being unable to 
achieve our goals.</p>
<p>Fear of losing control can come through a realization that we sometimes do 
not have the power to change the environment or what others think and do. 
Achieving our goals means coping with nature's events and influencing others. 
When we cannot do this we feel all at sea and out of control. </p>
<p>Other people have their own goals and may be uncaring about us or even 
manipulate us for their own ends. We fear being under the influence of others 
who get us to do things that we know are not in our best interests. They achieve 
this through power in various forms or may just be skilful at persuasion. When 
powerful others act against us we feel powerless and out of control. </p>
<p>Fear of losing control may be combined with other fears, such as of pain, 
loss, non-gain or extinction. </p>
<h2><a name="fai"></a>Fear of failure </h2>
<p>A key element of control is in control of oneself, both in managing the 
effects of emotions and in having the skills to achieve our goals. The thought 
that we may fail to get what we want can be rather scary. </p>
<p>A worry is that we will react unthinkingly, getting angry or excited and do 
things we will later regret. Failing to have sufficient self-control is a big 
issue for some people. </p>
<p>A more common fear is that we will fail at a task due to 
a lack of skills, making silly mistakes, being unable to influence others, or any of the many other reasons that 
things go wrong for us.</p>
<p>Associated with the fear of failure is the fear of being criticized by others 
and losing social position. </p>
<h2><a name="con"></a>Conditioned fear </h2>
<p>A different fear is that which has been conditioned into us. 
<a href="../behaviors/conditioning/conditioning.htm">Conditioning</a> 
takes an existing stimulus and response and connects in a new stimulus that soon 
also causes the response. Pavlov famously rang a bell when feeding a dog and 
found that before long just the sound of the bell was enough to make the dog 
salivate. It was also found that a bell could stimulate fear when associated 
with electric shocks. </p>
<p>Many of our conditioned fears originate in childhood where we erroneously 
connected available stimuli with unpleasant events. We may also learn later in 
life to always fear certain situations. </p>
<p>We can also have genetic fears, such as of spiders and snakes. Through 
countless generations we have become naturally fearful of certain animals and 
the sight of any scurrying and writhing can trigger a powerful fear response.</p>

<h1><a name="So"></a>So what?</h1>

<p>Understand how fear works. It can be perverse and hidden and lead people into 
strange actions. It can stop them changing or make them change with great speed. 
The above categories can help you identify and name fear, which is the first 
step to opposing or using it.</p>
<p>Cowardice is based in fear, possibly of pain but also possibly fearing other 
fears. Courage is feeling frightened but going ahead anyway, using willpower to 
overcome one's fear. You can overcome fear in yourself or others by stimulating 
and 'en-couraging' courage.</p>
<p>In your persuasions, act to counter fears that stop people changing and 
carefully use it to nudge them in the right direction, though do be careful of 
their fear reactions causing them to move in ways that you did not expect.</p>
