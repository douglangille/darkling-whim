<h1>The Formation of Belief</h1>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="../explanations.htm">Explanations </a>
&gt; <a href="belief.htm">Beliefs</a>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;The Formation of Belief</p>

<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="#Self">Self-generated belief</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="#External">Externally-generated 
belief</a> | <a href="#So">So what?</a></p>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beliefs can come from two sources: our own experience and reflections, or as 
a blind acceptance of what other people tell us. These are very different 
methods and are often based on very different 
<a href="../preferences/preferences.htm">preferences</a> and attitudes to the world and people around us.</p>

<h2><a name="Self"></a>Self-generated belief</h2>

<p>Self-generated beliefs are those we create ourselves. People who generally 
prefer to self-generate are often open, confident and <a href="../needs/curiosity.htm">
curious</a>. They seek truth over comfort and social acceptance. They may be 
distrusting of experts and other authorities. They prefer argument and debate to 
quick and blind acceptance. They are willing to live with uncertainty and 
ambiguity until their belief is formed.</p>

<h3>Experience</h3>

<p>'Experience is a hard master, but a fool will have no other.' It has a ring 
of truth about it, but also is the ultimate method we have of finding the truth. 
</p>
<p>Trying things for ourselves is how we start out as children and we continue to 
use this approach to some degree through our lives. 
The extent to which we 
continue to seek truth through experience depends on a range of factors, including 
parental guidance and the level and style of education we received.</p>
<p>Experience is useful for continuous improvement of the beliefs and models we 
use. For example a person may be bluntly honest at home, but finds that speaking 
your mind is not effective in particular work settings.</p>
<h3>Experiment</h3>
<p>Experience may come from thing that happen to us. It may also be deliberately 
sought, in particular when we try out various experiments.</p>
<p>In a scientific sense, truth comes from carefully designed experiments which
<i>prove</i> what is true and what is not. Yet 'proven' truths are constantly 
being challenged and re-examined. We may also do informal experiments in our 
daily lives to test and improve our beliefs.</p>
<p>A key benefit of thoughtful experimental&nbsp; is in sharpening beliefs, 
showing where they work and do not work. The rules that we create in sound
<a href="../research/research.htm">research</a> are hence more likely to be true 
and worth believing.</p>
<h3>Reflection</h3>

<p>A variation on external experimentation is internal reflection and thought. 
It is a lot easier and can often be done much quicker. It can be done in most 
places, although it is best done when there are less external distractions.</p>

<p>Reflection includes general musing about things and building internal 
<a href="../theories/schema.htm">mental models</a> which help to explain the 
external world.</p>

<p>In some ways reflection is opposite to experience in that it is internal 
rather than external. It can also be complementary as you either reflect <i>
after </i>an experience or seek experiences after internal reflection. </p>
<h3>Generalization</h3>
<p>A key part of self-created beliefs is when we take the results of experience 
and experiment, and (often through reflection) generalize this to assume that 
what we have discovered in one context is equally applicable elsewhere. For 
example if a child finds that nagging parents is successful, they may create a 
generalized belief that nagging is a useful and often necessary way of getting 
what they want with other people.</p>
<p>The problem with generalization from experience is that what is true in one 
situation is often not true in others. Formal experimentation can help to 
improve the quality of generalization yet we are still constrained by the time 
we have.</p>

<h2><a name="External"></a>Externally generated belief</h2>

<p>Done well, experience and experiment means trying things out in practice, 
observing things and generally getting a broad range of evidence before committing to a belief. 
Unfortunately we only have time try a limited number of things (and what we do 
try out can say a lot about us).</p>

<p>The alternative to finding things out for oneself is to take on board things 
that others have found out. People who generally prefer to accept beliefs from 
others typically have a greater need for a <a href="../needs/control.htm">sense of control</a>. 
They tend to seek <a href="../needs/certainty.htm">certainty</a> and rapid
<a href="../../principles/closure.htm">closure</a>, avoiding the uncertainty of 
exploration. They also are likely to have a greater tendency to
<a href="../trust/trust.htm">trust </a>others and to seek 
trustworthiness, although perhaps only in specific areas.</p>

<h3>Experts</h3>

<p>Experts are people who have proven themselves to have knowledge in particular 
areas. They may have qualifications or demonstrable and skills. They are often 
professionals who are paid for their expertise. When they tell you something, 
you have good reason to believe it.</p>

<p>Experts can be met in person or they may have written books or other media 
you can access. However you access their knowledge or skill, you trust them 
because you believe they are expert.</p>

<p>People who seek experts are relatively pragmatic. They trust, but not 
necessarily blindly. They are looking for someone to help in a specific area.</p>

<h3>Authority</h3>

<p>The difference between an expert and an authority is that you believe the 
authority because of their position or charismatic powers, and not because of 
any reasonable proof that they know well what they are talking about.</p>

<p>Managers, priests, and parents all offer beliefs based on their position 
rather than their expertise. In fact we all do it when we get into arguments 
where we <i>tell </i>rather than seeking to persuade.</p>

<p>People who believe authorities are 
<a href="../../disciplines/leadership/followership/followership.htm">followers</a>. They believe in the sanctity of 
position or may be gullible and easy to persuade. They are likely to have a strong 
need for <a href="../needs/belonging.htm">belonging</a> and social approval. 
They may single out specific people, who they will believe blindly. Cult leaders 
seek to place themselves in this position.</p>
<h3>Canons</h3>
<p>A 'canon' is an unchallenged set of 'truths' as set out in literature from 
religious texts to scientific papers. It is the set of 'truths' that most people 
working in the given area believe and accept without challenge. All work of 
discovery and discussion starts from these foundations.</p>
<p>To challenge a canon is to put yourself in the firing line, particularly from 
those who have founded their life's work on unquestioning acceptance of the 
canon. Yet this is how scientific breakthroughs occur. It also helps to explain 
why general acceptance and the creation of a new canon often takes a whole 
generation to achieve.</p>

<h1><a name="So"></a>So what?</h1>

<p>When you are seeking to change beliefs, find out where the other person gets 
their beliefs from. If they tend towards self-generated belief then give them 
experiences or rational arguments. If they are more external, then pose as an 
expert or authority, or bring in someone who can fulfil the appropriate role.</p>
