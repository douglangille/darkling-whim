<p>Praise is the act of making positive statements about a person. Is it a 
powerful motivator? Certainly, but you do have to get it right.</p>

<h2><a name="pow"></a>The power of praise</h2>
<p>Praise is often and rightly seen as a motivator, for example Blanchard and 
Johnson (1981) in their million-seller 'The One Minute Manager' recommend the 
'one minute praising' as a critical motivation. </p>
<h3>Affirmation </h3>
<p>Praise addresses the need for <a href="../needs/approval.htm">approval</a>. 
It affirms the person and their sense of
<a href="../identity/identity.htm">identity</a>. It develops
<a href="../meaning/meaning.htm">meaning</a> for their lives and tells them they 
are worthy. </p>
<h3>Surprise</h3>
<p>In its raw state, praise comes from a person who is pleasantly
<a href="../emotions/surprise.htm">surprised</a> as you achieve more than they 
had expected. Natural praise is not expected by the recipient and so also is a 
surprise.</p>
<h3>Conditioning</h3>
<p>Praise as a reward acts as a form of
<a href="../behaviors/conditioning/conditioning.htm">conditioning</a>, and is 
often intended this way. In conditioning, you get more of what you reward, so 
praising a person for things you want the to do is a way of getting them to 
behave more like this.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Criticism</h3>
<p>The opposite of praise is criticism and can easily act to demotivate, 
particularly if it is destructive or targeted at the person rather than what 
they have done. Even well-intentioned constructive criticism of a person's work 
can have the wrong effect if the person is not able to accept the comment. </p>
<h2><a name="pra"></a>The danger of praise</h2>
<p>It is very easy to get praise wrong. Here are a few ways that praise can 
unexpectedly demotivate people.</p>
<h3>Ability vs. effort</h3>
<p>Mueller and Dweck (1998) gave 400 children a test and then told each that 
they had got 80% right. They then told half that this must be because they were 
intelligent and the other half it must be because they worked hard. They then 
offered them all a choice of an easy task or a hard task. 65% of those told they 
were clever chose the easy task, which was chosen by only 45% of those who were 
praised for effort.</p>
<p>In other words, those who had been praised for being clever subsequently 
avoided difficult tasks that might make them appear less intelligent. 
Interestingly also, more of those who had&nbsp; been praised for effort chose 
the harder task as they now saw hard work as gaining desirable praise.</p>
<p>Further tests found that those praised for effort worked harder whilst those 
praised for intelligence worked less. If you tell a person they already have the 
ability do so something, you are also telling them that they do not need to 
work.</p>
<p>Gunderson et al (2013) observed praise of children
an 14, 26, 38 
months and then at five years. They found that those praised early for effort 
('process praise'), the more the five year olds saw intelligence and morality as 
malleable, with greater effort going to improving these.</p>
<h3>Suspicion</h3>
<p>We are a naturally suspicious species and when we are praised by someone, we 
do not automatically assume that the person means what they are saying. Tell a 
person they have done well and the first response might well be 'So what do you 
want?' The person can easily believe you are invoking the
<a href="../../principles/exchange.htm">exchange principle</a>, whereby you are 
giving praise in order to get something in return.</p>
<p>According to some research, by the age of 12 many children believe that 
praise from a teacher is a sign of encouragement rather than the teacher really 
is impressed.</p>
<h3>Self-esteem</h3>
<p>Praise is often used in an attempt to build self-esteem, based on the premise 
that a person with higher self-esteem will work harder. There can be a problem 
in this when the praise used in a general, non-specific way that says 'you are 
wonderful' but how. Self-esteem is a general feeling that is hard to pin down to 
specifics and so praise can be a mis-matched method that backfires through the 
cynicism it creates when not used in a genuine way.</p>
<p>Praise can make a person dependent, becoming a 'praise junkie' where their 
self-esteem lasts only as long as the latest praise. They seek constant 
reassurance and may become more
<a href="../../disciplines/psychoanalysis/concepts/narcissism.htm">narcissistic</a>. 
The self in self-esteem so decreases as they become dependent on the overt 
esteem of others. Image becomes everything as truth fades and they may even lie 
or cheat to sustain this facade. </p>
<h3>Social pressure</h3>
<p>There is often pressure on people to praise, from managers to teachers to 
parents. Books and training tell you that praise is essential and powerful, and 
that to not praise is to punish. So people praise simply because they think they 
should and because they see others praising and think they should do the same 
for want of being though a bad manager, teacher or parent.</p>
<p>In this way praise can easily become empty and meaningless, where the person 
praising does so because they think it is what is expected and the receiver does 
not believe the praise is genuine. Praise hence turns into a social ritual or a
<a href="../behaviors/games/games.htm">game</a> that is played for ulterior 
motives.</p>
<h3>Embarrassment</h3>
<p>Some people do not like being praised in front of others. This is typically 
because they feel that others may become jealous and that the relationship they 
have with them will suffer as a result. This damage is far worse than the 
accolade of praise and we typically try to moderate it with shows of modesty. </p>
<p>Public praise also puts you on a pedestal whereby you are hence expected to 
do no wrong from then on, making for a perception of a fragile future where you 
may anticipate failure and ridicule.</p>
<h3>Non-praise</h3>
<p>Another danger around praise is that if a person expects to be praised and 
they are not, then this can feel like punishment and act as a de-motivator. This 
can be seen when children show their work to their teachers (or adults to their 
bosses). If the work is ignored, then motivation goes down.</p>
<h3>Rationale</h3>
<p>Whatever happens around us we are always trying to work out <i>why </i>it 
happened. If someone praises us, we want to know why they are doing so. Only if 
we do something well then we feel that praise is deserved and are motivated by 
it.</p>
<h2><a name="eff"></a>Effective praising</h2>

<p>The bottom line is that praise is not a magic pill. If you praise anyone for 
anything, then the praise is meaningless. If you make them look good they may 
want to stay looking good and so become risk-averse.</p>
<p>For praise to be motivating it has to be <i>sincere, specific </i>and <i>
deserved</i>.</p>
<h3>Sincere</h3>
<p>To be sincere, you have to believe the praise that you are giving. For this, 
you need to make some kind of judgement that determines the person as good in 
some way, in comparison with some standard or mark. One way of doing this is 
noting that the person has improved in some way against their past self, doing 
things better or achieving some goal. Another way is comparing them with others, 
showing they are the best at something or better than another person. The former 
method is often the better approach as social comparison can also bring social 
anxieties with it.</p>
<p class="quote"><i>You have significantly improved your understanding of 
mathematics over the year.</i></p>
<p class="quote"><i>You are top of the class! Well done!! </i></p>
<p>A good way of showing sincerity is to make it personal, telling them how you 
feel about them.</p>
<p class="quote"><i>I like the way you have used a balance of shades across the 
picture. It makes me feel intrigued.</i></p>
<p>People are generally good at detecting deceit and an insincere praising can 
do significant damage to a relationship as well as making the target feel that 
the praiser can find nothing about which to praise them.
<a href="../trust/trust.htm">Trust</a> is an important component of believing in 
apparent sincerity.</p>
<h3>Specific</h3>
<p>Specific praise talks about the act or achievement of the person being 
praised. The word 'you' may well feature in the praise.</p>
<p class="quote"><i>You have passed all your finance exams now, making you fully 
qualified. Well done!</i></p>
<p>Praising can be about achieving a particular goal or can be about a specific 
act or activity.</p>
<p class="quote"><i>Thanks for cutting the grass for me. It looks really nice 
now.</i></p>
<p class="quote"><i>I like the way you are taking time to help your sister.</i></p>
<p>As praise seeks to encourage, then avoid praising for innate ability as this 
can result in the person doing less, so always praise for effort or achievement. 
Note that it is better to praise at the end of a piece of work rather than in 
the middle as this may create premature <a href="../../principles/closure.htm">
closure</a>.</p>
<p>If you are not specific about what you are praising the person for, two 
things can happen. First, they may generalize and assume that they are being 
praised almost just for existing. Secondly, they may be confused and not feel 
praised for anything. The critical thing about either of these is that no 
particular way of behaving has been reinforced and so you will not get more of 
what you want and may get things that what you do not want.</p>
<h3>Of process, cause and effect</h3>
<p>Praising what people do is more effective at creating improvement than when 
praise is just about the result. This can be used to praise hard work even if 
there was little success, and which hence leads to increased effort towards a 
later success.</p>
<p class="quote"><i>I can see how hard you worked, Well done! Even though it 
wasn't as successful this time, I'm sure if you keep working at it you'll get 
there. </i></p>
<p>Praise of the process can also be used to link effort to the result by 
highlighting cause and effect.</p>
<p class="quote"><i>Congratulations! You've got your degree. All that hard work 
has paid off.</i></p>
<h3>Deserved</h3>
<p>When a person is praised for something, they may well feel that they deserve 
the praise, in which case they feel affirmed and justified and that they have 
received the due reward for their actions. </p>
<p class="quote"><i>Well done. We made our numbers this month and it was mostly 
down to your work with Andarex.</i></p>
<p>If the person does not feel that the praise is deserved, then they will check 
for sincerity of the speaker. If they do not feel the other person is sincere, 
then they will not accept that they deserve the praise. </p>
<p>If they do feel the person is sincere and they are not expecting praise then 
they will feel pleasantly <a href="../emotions/surprise.htm">surprised</a>. This 
is a particularly important reason for sincerity of praise.</p>
