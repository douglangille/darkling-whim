what?</a></p>

</p>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Evolution is the process whereby creatures compete, adapt and survive in the 
changing environment, by changing themselves. Here is a simple set of rules that 
describe how we evolve.</p>

<h2 ALIGN="left"><a name="rep"></a>Reproduction</h2>
<p ALIGN="left">A key aspect of life is that we create more life through 
reproduction. Without enough children to propagate generations, a species will 
die out.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Finding a mate</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">The first and most important step on the road to reproduction is 
finding a mate, including fighting off rivals and wooing the potential partner. 
Rituals and fine plumage can be seen across the animal kingdom and even flowers 
use bright colors to attract insects which will help them pollinate. </p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Inheritance</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">We inherit genes and hence characteristics from our parents, 
creating species stability. In particular if both mother and father have the 
same characteristic, whether it is blue eyes or greater height, then the 
offspring are more likely to follow suit, although throwbacks to previous 
generations is possible, as is genetic mutation.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Quantity</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">The more a life-form reproduces, the more children it has, the 
greater the chance of some of them surviving to be able to reproduce themselves, 
which is a critical requirement for species survival. </p>
<p ALIGN="left">Some creatures use this quantity principle, for example by laying huge numbers of eggs. 
Others manage on far less offspring. Creating many children is an adaptive 
mechanism for prey, where many will be eaten or otherwise not survive harsh 
conditions. Robust predators, on the other hand, can continue the species with 
few children. </p>
<p ALIGN="left">Quantity is also related to resource availability. More children 
take more work to feed and protect, and will only survive if there is enough 
food and shelter for them.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Fertility</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">Many creatures are fertile or 'in heat' only at certain times in 
a cycle. For many, this is driven by the time of year when food and warmth will 
be available. Fertility also relates to the ease with which a mother can be 
fertilized. </p>
<p ALIGN="left">The question of fertility applies to both mother and father. The 
more fertile the parents and the longer they are fertile, the more children can 
be produced. </p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Maturation</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">There is also the question of how long it takes for children to 
be reared to adult maturity, where they can start producing their own 
children. This varies across species from hours to years. </p>
<p ALIGN="left">If children take a long time to mature, then a species must be able 
to ensure survival of the children not only long enough to have their own children but also long enough 
again so that the children reach maturity and can themselves reproduce.</p>
<h2 ALIGN="left"><a name="var"></a>Variation</h2>
<p ALIGN="left">A critical element of reproduction is that there is variation 
from one generation to the next. No individual is genetically identical to a 
parent. </p>
<p ALIGN="left">Variation is good for helping cope with changing conditions. It 
can also be bad when effective characteristics are lost. Variation hence needs 
to balance with stability.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Inheritance</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">We inherit genes from both of our parents. The very fact that we 
need two parents is common for most of the life forms on Earth and creates 
significant variation as we take some things from our mother and some from our 
father. </p>
<p ALIGN="left">If creatures are not able to reproduce, either because they die 
early or because they cannot find a mate, then they will not pass on their 
ineffective characteristics to their children.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Fidelity</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">Another force for variation is the extent to which individual 
and species are monogamous, polygamous or are just disloyal, taking one or more 
mates. </p>
<p ALIGN="left">Monogamy is good for ensuring males stay around to help the 
female and their offspring survive. </p>
<p ALIGN="left">Polygamy allows those who are better at attracting mates and 
fending off mate competition to spread their seed further. In polygamous 
species, the male is often larger in order to fight off competition. Female 
polygamy does happen, but is far less common.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Others either do not have any long-term relationship with a mate 
or stray outside of the relationship, opportunistically reproducing where they 
can. Humans are largely monogamous but, as many discover, can also be disloyal.
</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Mutation</h3>
<p ALIGN="left"><a href="mutation.htm">Mutation</a> of genes occurs naturally to 
create a wide range of possible physiological and neurological changes, from extra limbs to varying mental 
abilities. This is a critical mechanism that works outside the constraints of 
inheritance to potentially create whole new species.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">It would take a long time for evolution to work if it worked 
like science, with one carefully controlled experiment at a time. Instead, it 
uses <i>massive parallelism</i>, with each living thing, with its individual 
mutations, being an experiment. In this way, many unsuccessful experiments die 
out (or just don&#39;t have surviving children) while the many more successful 
experiments get to propagate their progeny.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Environmental variation</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">As well as individual changes there are changes in the 
environment in which they live. This can include changes in weather, vegetation, 
geography and other species. A key reason for evolution is to be able to cope 
with these external changes.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Prey and predators are significant as they form a direct part of 
the food chain that affects a creature&#39;s existence. We live within a hugely 
entangled, complex species</p>
<h2 ALIGN="left"><a name="sel"></a>Selection</h2>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Predators and disease</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">We are all predators of some kind, as life feeds on other life, 
even if it is just vegetables and fruit. Even bacteria and viruses may be seen 
as predators who live and reproduce by feeding on more developed forms of life. 
Although it is less common, there may also be predators within one's own 
species.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">A critical factor for survival of prey is the ability to outwit 
and escape predators, and evolution has produced some incredible variations 
which do just that, from camouflage to spikes to off-putting smells.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Competition for limited resources</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">Another key force in evolution is that there are limited 
resources for which there may be fierce competition. First of all, this is about 
food, water and other sustenance. When the food supply runs down or the 
population increases too far, then only those who can garner enough supplies to 
live will survive. Space also becomes important, particularly when you dominate 
an area in which your food lives. This allows creatures to feed their children 
and so allow the 
species (or, more accurately, their genetic variant) to survive.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">For example plants grow longer roots to reach the water 
and grow taller to reach the sun, spreading their leaves over less evolved 
competitors. Animals may grow larger and stronger, although smaller creatures 
handle limited supplies simply by needing less. A species can overwhelm others 
just by weight of numbers, such as when locusts rapidly consume all of the food 
needed by others. </p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Competition for mates</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">To reproduce, you need a mate, not just sustenance. This means 
you must attract or woo her or him, for example with the brilliant plumage and 
elaborate rituals of birds. </p>
<p ALIGN="left">The other problem to handle is competition from others in 
attracting mates who are most likely to ensure the birth and survival of your 
progeny. Hence (and particularly in polygamous species) many males are large, strong and fierce, 
in order to fight off other males, 
both in attraction and defence of their female partners.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Coping with environmental change</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">Selection is also done in an overall sense through the ability 
of the individual to cope with their environment, including the changes that 
occur here. When it becomes hotter or colder, wetter or drier and so on, the species 
that survive are those that are either more suited to the new environment or are 
able to adapt to it quickly enough.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">New environments shake things up, even if a species does 
survive. An animal that thrived in the great plains may become much less 
dominant when the plains shrink.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">It is a mark of the success of homo sapiens that we have adapted 
to more climatic and geographic environments than any other species.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Hierarchy and roles</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">When animals live in groups they often form hierarchies and 
defined roles, such as for foraging and child-care, in which natural selection will 
have a hand. For example if the carer is too uncaring or if there are not enough foragers, then 
survival will be threatened.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">In tribal societies, status is very important and there are 
clear pecking orders, with rules for what each level can and cannot do as well 
as rules for how individuals reach each level. Selection is interesting here, as 
those at lower levels may get to the remains of the food last, whilst those in 
higher status positions are often under threat from attack by 'social climbers' 
all around them.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Collaboration and learning</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">The extent to which a species can learn and share knowledge will 
also affect its ability to survive. There is a classic story of how blue-tit 
birds 
learned to pierce 20th century aluminium foil milk-bottle caps in the UK in 
order to 
drink the cream beneath. One bird discovered this, then as they are a social 
species, blue-tits were soon doing this all across the country. Robins, on the 
other hand, did not learn this as they are solitary birds and even if some discovered this, the practice 
did not spread to other robins.</p>

<h1><a name="So"></a>So what?</h1>
<p>Evolution still happens and we are all subject to its rules. Even though we 
have been 'civilized' for many years, by the timescale of evolution we are not 
long out of the jungle and the internal drivers for survival still affect us.</p>
<p>Natural selection can be seen in the way individuals find mates and how 
people rise up within social and organizational hierarchies. Business change is 
similar to environmental change and those who adapt best are those who survive 
and rise up the hierarchy. </p>
<p>Whenever you are looking at changing minds, consider the processes of 
evolution with questions such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>What partners do you need? How can you woo them?</li>
	<li>Is it better to be loyal or get a wider experience?</li>
	<li>Who are your competitors? How are they learning and evolving?</li>
	<li>What form does hierarchy and status take? How might this change?</li>
	<li>What variation may happen? How can you use this principle?</li>
	<li>How can you spread your ideas? How do ideas thrive or get killed off?</li>
	<li>What changes in the environment are happening? Who will survive them? 
	How?</li>
</ul>

<p>The principle of massive parallelism can also be used in thinking. Rather 
than have just a single hypothesis, try considering a wide range of 
possibilities, then eliminating one hypothesis at a time as disconfirming 
evidence is found.</p>
