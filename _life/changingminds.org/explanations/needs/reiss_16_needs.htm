<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Steven Reiss has identified sixteen needs based on studies of over 6000 
people. Each of these is discussed below.</p>
<p>Reiss also developed a 'Profile of Human Needs' as a form of personality 
instrument, in which people answer a questionnaire that determines the degree of 
need they have in each dimension, relative to other people. Realizing these can 
be used to 
help explain much interpersonal misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Here is a brief discussion of each dimension.</p>
<h2><a name="acc"></a>Acceptance</h2>
<p>This is the need for social approval by others, to be accepted into society 
and social <a href="../groups/groups.htm">groups</a>. Acceptance is related to 
Maslow's need for <a href="belonging.htm">belonging</a>. </p>
<p>This is important in <a href="../evolution/evolution.htm">evolutionary</a> terms as when we are accepted we gain the 
protection and support of the group. When we are accepted, we can also seek to 
satisfy other needs, such as starting a family and gaining status.</p>
<h2><a name="cur"></a>Curiosity</h2>
<p><a href="curiosity.htm">Curiosity</a> is the drive that pushes us to learn 
new things. This is important to get us out of our comfort zones and may be 
considered a fundamental force of evolution. If we did not learn, we would not 
be able to cope with changing conditions and would soon die out.</p>
<h2><a name="eat"></a>Eating</h2>
<p>We of course need to eat to survive, which means nature has given us a desire 
to eat and made it pleasant for us. When we are hungry we seek food, and the 
hungrier we are, the greater the urge to eat.</p>
<p>We also like to eat 'good food' with pleasant appearance, taste and texture. 
Even people who have little, when they get more money, they tend to buy nicer 
food rather than just more cheap food.</p>
<p>Eating marks out the day and helps build circadian rhythms. We also eat 
socially and family meals are important events, as are business lunches and romantic 
dinners.</p>
<h2><a name="fam"></a>Family</h2>
<p>When asked what is most important to them, many would say their family. We 
seek to help our families and 'kin selection' is a common principle when making choices.</p>
<p>We are also of course driven to build families, which is one reason sex is so 
pleasurable for us, as is the thrill of love and romance.</p>
<h2><a name="hon"></a>Honor</h2>
<p>Our personal integrity and a sense of honor is important as we seek
<a href="consistency.htm">consistency</a> between our actions and our
<a href="../values/values.htm">values</a>. When a person is consistent then 
others can <a href="prediction.htm">predict</a> their actions, which makes them 
more socially acceptable. While we feel a 
sense of honor, it is created through the respect that others give us and is related 
to Maslow's <a href="esteem.htm">esteem</a>.</p>
<p>The rules of honor are often defined by groups and societies and include 
rules for everyday behavior and also what must be done when the honor of the 
group or individual is challenged. There may be a need to defend one's honor 
when one's <a href="status.htm">status</a> or integrity is threatened, which can lead to strange 
aggressions even where the aggressor will very likely be defeated. Honor 
cultures are common in regions where there is little rule of law and people live 
by their reputations.</p>
<h2><a name="ide"></a>Idealism</h2>
<p>Idealism is an adherence to ideas that are often clean and untainted by the 
messiness of everyday life. Believing in the ideal makes life easier and may 
allow us to deny or ignore life's complications. It also helps when the ideal is 
shared, such as in religions and politics as this helps social cohesion. 
Idealism can also help with giving one's life greater meaning.</p>
<p>Idealism includes the need for <a href="fairness.htm">fairness</a> and 
justice, where each person gets what they deserve and those who transgress rules 
are proportionately punished.</p>
<h2><a name="ind"></a>Independence</h2>
<p>While we like to belong to groups, we also seek an independence where we feel 
as a separate person, with our own individuality. Independence helps create our 
unique sense of <a href="identity.htm">identity</a>. Being independent also 
means not having to obey others all the time and hence also boosts our sense of
<a href="control.htm">control</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="ord"></a>Order</h2>
<p>When there is order, things are <a href="prediction.htm">predictable</a>, 
which gives us a sense of <a href="control.htm">control</a>. People who seek 
order will be more organized and tidy and will plan for an ordered future. This 
is in contrast to those who leave things to the last minute and are happy with 
chaos in their lives (these people get their sense of control more from the 
choices they feel they still have).</p>
<h2><a name="phy"></a>Physical activity</h2>
<p>Physical activity makes use of our bodies and so creates physical
<a href="arousal.htm">arousal</a>. Physicality is a primitive thing that animals 
delight in as can be seen as young and adults wrestle and play-fight. In humans 
we replicate this in physical games such as football and athletic sports.</p>
<h2><a name="pow"></a>Power</h2>
<p>There are many forms of <a href="../power/power.htm">power</a>, which may be 
defined as having the potential to achieve our goals, even if others oppose us. 
Power helps give us a sense of <a href="control.htm">control</a>. It also 
confers status and lets us move up social hierarchies. It also helps our 
evolutionary need to survive and to attract and keep the best possible mate (as 
seen by the way power is attractive for many women).</p>
<h2><a name="rom"></a>Romance</h2>
<p>Romance is a step along the path to family and replicating our genes. We get 
a buzz from the excitement of the chase and the thrill of newness and 
possibility. Love is a powerful force, especially new love, and we can even 
'fall in love with falling in love' in a kind of addiction to new romances that 
never lead to stable relationships.</p>
<h2><a name="sav"></a>Saving</h2>
<p>One of the curious facts of human motivation is that we gain pleasure in 
collecting things. This is related to the desire to possess and also can give us 
an ongoing interest in learning about the collected subject and looking out for 
items not in our collection. Perhaps an evolutionary driver of this is the need 
to gather food and things to help our ancestors survive the long cold winters.</p>
<h2><a name="soc"></a>Social contact</h2>
<p>We like to meet and be with others. Without human contact we become lonely 
and depressed, which is perhaps why solitary confinement is such a cruel 
punishment. Contact is sustained and pleasure deepened when we make and meet 
with friends, who help sustain this need.</p>
<h2><a name="sta"></a>Social status</h2>
<p>Once we have friends and belong to groups, we seek the <a href="esteem.htm">
esteem</a> of others that will help us gain
<a href="status.htm">status</a>. This can be a powerful 
underlying force and can be seen in many conversations where we duel for 
supremacy, boasting of our achievements and downplaying those of others.</p>
<h2><a name="tra"></a>Tranquility</h2>
<p>As well as arousal and action, we like to find peace and quiet. There is much 
to be said for taking time out to sit and chill, maybe reading a book or just 
contemplating the stars. <a href="../emotions/happiness/epicurean_pleasure.htm">
Epicurus</a> highlighted this as katastemic happiness, the pleasure of being 
rather than doing.</p>
<h2><a name="ven"></a>Vengeance</h2>
<p>In the same manner as the needs for honor and fairness, when we are wronged we seek 
revenge, typically looking for some form of <a href="../trust/four_justice.htm">
justice</a> that gives us satisfaction and punishes those who transgress against 
us. We also like to compete, which is perhaps a structured form of this need. </p>

<h1><a name="So"></a>So what?</h1>

<p>When looking at others, think about how important each of these needs are to 
them. Then focus your persuasions based on the more significant needs that they 
have.</p>
