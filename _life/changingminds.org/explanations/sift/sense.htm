<h1>Sensing the world around us</h1>

<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="../explanations.htm">Explanations</a>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<a href="sift.htm">The
SIFT Model</a> &gt; Sensing the world around us</p>

<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="#outside">The outside world</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="#five">Five
senses: the interface</a>&nbsp; | <a href="#preferences">Preferences: the first
filter</a>| <a href="#inside">The really inside world</a>
| <a href="#so">So what</a></p>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have five senses with which to sense what is happening in
the world around us, although these are not equal. In particular, what we see
dominates the other senses, closely followed by what we hear. Touch, taste and
smell are significant in specific circumstances (such as eating), but for change
they are seldom of interest. This stream of input into our brains is guided by
our attention, which turns our heads and moves our bodies, as well as being able
to create a narrow or broad focus.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="center"><img border="0" src="../../images/sense.gif" width="100%"></p>
<p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 ALIGN="left"><a name="outside"></a>The outside world</h2>
<p ALIGN="left">The outside world is full of people, machines, trees and much,
much more. Or at least so we have inferred. Actually, all that is really there
is space, time, energy and matter (and even that can be debated). Everything
else is an interpretation that comes later during the inference activity whereby
we create meaning from the four basic inputs.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Space</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">As far as we can tell from our senses, there are three
dimensions of space. This can be seen via the light energy which reflects off
surfaces. It can be heard through echoes (bats see with their ears). It can also
be sensed by touch, as we feel the shape of the world around us.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Time</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">Time is a mysterious thing, because we do not directly sense it.
We actually create our sense of time internally. This makes it a very flexible
perception that can be manipulated during interactions with other people.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Energy</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">Energy includes heat, electromagnetic energy (light, microwaves,
radio, etc.), the kinetic energy of movement, chemical and nuclear energy. Sound
is really waves of kinetic energy as air molecules strike our ears.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Matter</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">Matter is the physical atoms and molecules of solids, liquids
and gases. Matter gives off heat energy that we can detect through touch. We can
smell gases and taste solids and liquids. Strangely, the closer we get to
understanding matter, the less we find is actually there. Atoms are hollow, as
are electrons: all that seems to be there is more energy.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 ALIGN="left"><a name="five"></a>Five senses: the interface</h2>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Attention: the shining torch</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">Our attention is like a torch, shining into areas where we are
interested. We move our body, turn our head, and in doing so we focus and limit
what is available for our senses.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">There are two zones of attention: the real zone of close is very
small. For example at any one time we visually focus on only a spot about an
inch in diameter. We also have a much broader zone of awareness, although much
of this is actually filled in later by our very helpful brains.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Men and women tend to be different in the focus of attention
they follow. Men typically will focus on one thing at one time. For example when
they are watching a football match, their ears will seem to 'turn off'. Women
can do more things at once, watching a television program whilst holding a
conversation and maybe even doing some knitting. This is not a item of gender
bias: it comes from the different way our brains are wired.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Vision</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">Vision is often a the primary sense as we get much useful
information about the world around us from what we see. It is also complex and
requires a lot of neural processing to turn it into useful information.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">What we can see is limited by spectrum and intensity of
electromagnetic radiation to which our eyes are sensitive. Too bright a light
hurts, although we can see with surprising little illumination.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Hearing</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">Sound is usually the second most important sense as we not only
detect things around us but very importantly use it for our major form of
communication: language (without which, we would arguably be little better than
our chimpanzee cousins). We also use little noises in our communication, perhaps
throwing back to our animal past.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Our hearing is limited to frequencies at best from about 20Hz to
20,000Hz. Above about 100 decibels sound is no longer useful: it is only
painful.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Touch</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">Touch is how we connect with the world around us, and our hands
are one of our most important organs in this area.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">We sometimes communicate with each other through touch, although
this can be very intimate activity. Touching another person can be a sign of
affection or (if it is rougher) a very clear indicator of dislike.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Something that we often do not notice is that we detect our
emotions through touch. When we feel happy, angry or sad, these appear literally
as bodily sensations, such as tingling or tension in the skin or deeper
muscles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Taste</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">Taste is little used in communication, although it can have a
strong pleasure element. It is well known by sales people that careful
conversation over a good lunch is a powerful persuasion tool.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Smell</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">Smell is closely related to taste. In fact much of what we call
taste is actually smell (which is why things become tasteless when we have a
cold). Smell can be very evocative of emotions from disgust (at someone with bad
breath or who breaks wind) to pleasure (from pheromones to perfumes). Smell is
also the only sense that is wired directly into our cortex: all other senses are
filtered through the mid-brain. Some of our earliest memories are around smells,
and the smell of baby talcum powder will send many people into paroxysms of
nostalgia.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Our sense of smell is so powerful, we can detect as little as
one molecule. Excessive smell can be overpowering, as skunks know very well.</p>
<h2 ALIGN="left"><a name="preference"></a>Preferences: the first filter</h2>
<p ALIGN="left">All senses are not equal for each person and we all have
different balance of preferences for each one. Perhaps these preferences are
learned in childhood, as we find greater value in visual or auditory signals and
then naturally pay more attention to these, at the expenses of our other senses.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">The extent to which we can gain information from a single sense
is illustrated by those who have lost one sense and compensate through another.
Blind person often have remarkable hearing and the deaf see things that many
others do not.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Common preferences&nbsp;</h3>
<p ALIGN="left"> Some people have a
preference for visual signals (and will hence direct their attention this way).
This is probably the most popular preference, as the world is literally always
in your face. People who are blind are more impaired and have more problems
adapting than those who have lost their other senses.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Other people are more attuned to the sounds around them, often in particular the
intonation of others' voices.&nbsp;They may find more pleasure in music and are
able to distinguish finer note divisions.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Other filters</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">Touch, taste and smell, although evocative typically contain too
little information to be a preference channel for communication. Nevertheless,
we each have levels of preference for each of these.&nbsp;These senses do come
into their own, but more in specific circumstances, such as at meal times.</p>
<h2 ALIGN="left"><a name="inside"></a>The really inside world</h2>
<p ALIGN="left">One of the most amazing capabilities of our minds is to recreate
the outside world inside our heads. Through memories and our imagination, we
reconstruct old and construct new images and sensations.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">It's all the same</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">The even more amazing thing about our imagined worlds is that we
often cannot tell the difference between what is real and what is imagined. Yes,
of course there are many times when we know that we are actually thinking about
future possibilities or having fanciful daydreams. Yet much of our memories as
remembered are actually reconstructed from a few recalled key points. We also
react to other people based not on what they actually intend, but on what we
have imagined for them.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">In and out during communication</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">When we are talking with other people, we alternate between the
outer world and our inner world. Outside we are sensing and then interpreting it
back inside. In the deeper inside world we are wondering what they really mean,
forecasting what they will say next, sizing them up or maybe even daydreaming
about a completely different problem.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">It's only inside</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">There is a school of thought that says the outside world does
not exist, and that we invent it for our pleasure. What we do know is that we
are trapped inside our bodies and what we do interact with is not what is
outside but the interpretation of the noise from our senses that we create on
the inside. 'Reality' is, effectively, a constructed concept.</p>
<h1 ALIGN="left"><a name="so"></a>So What?</h1>
<p ALIGN="left">So find out what senses to which they may most attention and
then provide a proportionate amount of information to those senses.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">You can even reach from one sense to the other. For example, to
a person who has a visual preference, you can use words like 'look', 'see',
'bright', 'blue' and so on.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Use smells subtly. Always make sure you do not smell unpleasant
(ask a friend). Use a good cologne. Use breath freshener if necessary, although
beware of over-use. Subtly means that the other person should not consciously
detect your smells, other than perhaps an occasional pleasant whiff.</p>
