<p align="left">We effectively pass our senses through a series of automatic
filters that each act to give meaning to what has happened. Some of these
necessarily come first, such as the recognition of a person. Other filters are
less sequence-dependent and in practice it is more of a network of activities
where the meaning created by one filter may lead to another filter being
re-applied to create additional meaning in the light of this new interpretation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../images/inference_filters.gif" width="100%"></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<h2 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="Classification"></a>Classification</h2>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Classification answers the basic question &#8216;What am I
perceiving?&#8217; and when compared with previous similar experiences may allow
other information to be deduced.</p>

<h3 align="left"><a name="recognition"></a>Basic recognition</h3>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first thing that we do when receiving an input from our
senses is to break it up into pieces that we can classify according to the
patterns we have stored in our memories.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recognition comes in stages. We first recognize the general
item from its shape, color, smell, etc. (&#8216;That is a hat&#8217;). We may then
classify it further ('That is a top hat') and even make specific attributions
about it ('That is my top hat!').&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we cannot easily classify something, we will try to
approximate it to an available classification (&#8216;That looks like a hat&#8217;). Our
minds are very good at pattern-matching and even a rough shape under a blanket
may be perceived as a hat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the rare occasions when we cannot even approximate a classification we
might dismiss the perception (using the relevance filter), invent a new
classification (for which we may need more data) or be worried by the threat
that it might pose to us (using the forecasting filter).</p>
<h3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="context"></a>The context filter</h3>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Imagine someone pointing a knife at you. How do you interpret
that? If it&#8217;s a dark night and you are in a shady part of town, then it will
have a different meaning from if you are in the kitchen and a member of the
family is handing you the butter knife.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The surrounding context in which events happen has a
significant effect on how we interpret those events. It is thus a good idea when
you want to change someone to go somewhere where the surroundings are conducive
to them agreeing with you. To achieve compliance, put them in a formal context.
To get enthusiasm, seek out stimulation. For relaxing find somewhere informal
and quiet.</p>
<h2 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="Interests"></a>Alignment with interests</h2>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I have identified what I am perceiving, I can then add
further meaning in terms of those things that are important to me or in which I
have some interest. This includes specific goals and general areas of interest.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="success"></a>Success criteria</h3>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we are considering the meaning of something after we
have taken some form of action to try and achieve our considered goals (and a
large amount of what we do can be viewed in this way), then we view what has
happened in comparison with those goals. For example, if you were doing an
experiment with a way of working, if you achieved your goals or even seemed to
be heading in the right direction, then you may well consider this a success and
consequently be pleased.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="relevance"></a>The relevance filter</h3>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you are thinking of using a new advertising campaign or
are an advertising professional then all adverts will be relevant to you and you
will take notice of them more than other people. This is your relevance filter
clicking in, saying &#8216;hang on a minute, out of all the irrelevant junk that has
been passing before my eyes, this bit is actually of interest.&#8217;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same effect happens when you have recently bought a new
car and suddenly you seem to notice every car like yours on the road. Things at
the top of your mind will act as filters on your perceptions.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If what we are perceiving is relevant to what we do or our
broad areas of interest, then we will give it more time to understand its true
meaning, especially as it relates to our goals.</p>
<h2 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="Future"></a>Future implications</h2>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The future is all we have left, but it is uncertain and
difficult to control. We thus pay close attention to the sequence of events
through time and what the future might mean.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="forecast"></a>The forecast filter</h3>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having a gun poked in your face can be very scary. But why?&#8211;it
is only a piece of metal. What happens is that we take our current experience
and extrapolate it into the future, typically using our mental models (which are
often wrong or limited) and then create meaning from the future we see.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A particularly important forecast that we frequently are
looking for is how things might threaten us. This is understandable when viewed
in the evolutionary light, as there was much in the primitive jungles to
threaten our forefathers.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Forecasts can also be positive and an optimist will interpret
many situations has having potential for interesting gains.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="expectation"></a>The expectation filter</h3>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you buy a new computer and the salesperson tells you that
it has studio-quality video graphics, then anything less than an excellent
picture will probably disappoint you. Having had your expectations set, the
meaning you create from your experience is now relative to those expectations.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Expectations may come from previous experience, forecast
futures or from an external source, such as when we accept someone else&#8217;s
forecasts about what will happen. When we are heavily influenced by other
people, many of our expectations are likely to come from them.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When what actually happens is not what we expected, we are
surprised. If what happens is interpreted positively, then we are delighted. If
we are surprised in a negative way, then we are disappointed. Surprise often
leads to us changing behavior or doing something different (such as not buying
anything else from the computer shop).</p>
<h2 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="Judgment"></a>Judgment</h2>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Beyond recognition and success, I can also make judgments
about what I am perceiving, to determine whether it is good or bad, trustworthy
or not.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="evaluation"></a>The evaluation filter</h3>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you see someone shouting at a child, what do you thing
about this behavior? Do you feel that it is wrong? If so, you are evaluating it
in terms of your own values, your individual system of right and wrong.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People with strong moral and ethical drivers will tend to be
very evaluative in their interpretations of the world around them. Judgments are
affected by established mental models such as when you show a new invention to
other people, who seem to see its faults and how it will not work, rather than
consider its possibilities.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our education system is based on criticism, and we learn what
is right very often by avoiding what is wrong. We thus cannot help but to adopt
much of this critical attitude and consequently can filter out creative
opportunity through our evaluation of our experiences.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="trust"></a>The trust filter</h3>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consider what you would think if someone, who in the past had
deliberately deceived you, came to you with an idea for increasing productivity
in your workplace. Your first thought might, quite legitimately, be &#8216;what is
this person trying to trick me into now?&#8217; The same applies to inanimate
objects, for example if a car keeps breaking down on you, you might never buy
that make ever again.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Trust is one of the key reasons that we form groups of
friends and band into companies. We in effect say, &#8216;If I help you today, I
trust that you will help me in return in the future.&#8217; Ongoing relationships
are about delayed exchanges in value. It is also what brand names are all about.
When we buy from Sony or BMW we are trusting them to provide us with a high
quality product.</p>

<h2 align="left"><a name="influences"></a>Other influences</h2>

<h3 align="left">Deep stuff</h3>

<p align="left">The filters all draw from our deeper systems, including needs,
goals, values, beliefs and mental models. These act in varying degrees within
each filter--for example, the evaluation filter draws heavily on our values. The
filters are also affected by our memories.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3 align="left">Emotional state</h3>

<p align="left">How we interpret our experiences will also depend on our current
emotional state. If we are happy, then events will be inferred to be far more
positive than if we are in a depressed state.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
