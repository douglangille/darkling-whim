<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="cha"></a>Characteristics</h2>
<p>Addiction is a commonly used word to indicate that a person repeatedly 
behaves in a certain way. Certain characteristics are common: </p>

<h3>Craving</h3>
<p><a href="craving.htm">Craving</a> is a strong desire that can be virtually omnipresent. This may appear 
in an obsessive way, where the person thinks about the addiction almost 
constantly.</p>
<h3>Compulsion</h3>
<p>The addict may feel driven to engage in the given behavior, with a desire so 
strong they seem unable to say 'no', even if they know that the addiction is 
harmful. It is perhaps the associated loss of control that makes addiction so 
troublesome.</p>
<h3>Repetition</h3>
<p>The addictive behavior is repeated in predictable patterns. In extreme, this 
is to the exclusion or reduction of many other 'normal' activities, including 
socializing, eating and sleeping.</p>
<h3>Benefit</h3>
<p>The thing to which the person is addicted has some benefit for them. This may 
be direct or indirect stimulation of pleasurable feelings, including euphoria, 
relaxation and general feelings of well-being.</p>
<p>Benefit many also be gained through anesthetization and numbing of unpleasant 
feelings, such as those experienced in depression.</p>
<h3>Harm</h3>
<p>Addiction often has the connotation of harm, with the notion that the addict 
will, sooner or later, be harmed by being addicted. This may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Physiological harm, for example where brain cells are damaged.</li>
  <li>Psychological harm, for example where they may become depressed.</li>
  <li>Social harm, where they become outcasts with few friends and little social 
  support.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dependence</h3>

<p>A dependent person cannot do without some named thing. They have an <i>
attachment</i> to it that may be physiological, psychological or some 
combination of the two.</p>
<p>If the dependent person is deprived 
of their target, then they suffer in some way, experiencing some kind of <i>
withdrawal</i> symptoms. These can range from the 'cold turkey' fever of 
withdrawal from 'hard' drugs to irritability and moodiness when a child is 
denied access to their favorite computer game.</p>
<p>Withdrawal is often an opposite effect. Heroin causes euphoria, relaxation 
and constipation. When it is removed the person gets dysphoria, cramping and 
diarrhea.</p>
<h3><a name="tol"></a>Tolerance/sensitivity</h3>
<p>Some addictions result in the person becoming <i>tolerant</i> to the point 
where repeated action leads to decreasing effect.</p>
<p>In other addictions, the person is <i>sensitized</i>, such that smaller 
actions are required for the same effect.</p>

<h2><a name="dis"></a>Discussion</h2>

<p ALIGN="left">The term 'addiction' is often used quite loosely in common 
conversation with phrases such as 'marijuana is addictive' or 'he's addicted to 
computer games' without too much consideration of what the boundaries of the 
'addiction' classification might be. </p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Physiological and psychological</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">Addiction is often separated into physiological addiction, as 
characterized by the use of hard drugs, and psychological addiction, such as 
nymphomania or excessive video gaming. In practice it is difficult to separate 
these, for example in the way that psychological 'choices' use the physiological 
systems of the brain.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Heritability</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">It is often believed that some people are more susceptible to 
addiction than others, inheriting this tendency through their genes. As an 
example, a study has shown that over a third of relatives of people with an 
alcohol use disorder also suffer from alcohol abuse, and even more so amongst 
siblings. Whilst there appears to be clear proof in this, the effect is 
difficult to determine exactly, as other factors such as socioeconomic status 
can have cloaking effects. Adoption studies have, however, proved more clearly 
that alcohol dependence susceptibility has a genetic aspect. </p>
<p ALIGN="left">Twin studies have led to estimates of the heritability of 
alcohol dependence ranging from 39 to 60% of the total variance (Heath, 1995, 
and others). Similarly, the heritability of smoking addiction has been estimated 
at 53% (Heath and Martin, 1993), and that for nicotine dependence between 60 and 
70% (Kendler et al. 1999). </p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Neuroadaptation</h3>
<p ALIGN="left"><i>Neuroadaptation</i> is a theory of dependence that assumes 
changes in the brain following significant drug usage. <i>Within-systems 
adaptation</i> occur where changes are within a single neural system and 
between-systems adaptation occurs where multiple systems are affected.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Discontinuance of the drug thence disrupts the balanced 
homeostasis that has been set up, causing withdrawal symptoms.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Learning and habit</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">Addiction can be viewed as a form of learning, albeit aberrant, 
and <a href="../../learning/learning.htm">learning theory</a> can be applied. </p>
<p ALIGN="left">'Habit' is a form of instrumental learning where a stimulus 
elicits a response without reference to the goal (reinforcer) that originally 
motivated the learning. In other words, it becomes a relatively unthinking 
action.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Behaviorism</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">Addiction can also be linked to psychological factors whereby 
the addict becomes <a href="../conditioning/conditioning.htm">
conditioned</a> into use of the behavior. This may be applied to drug use, which 
may be directly linked to neural effects, and other forms of addiction which 
seem to have a more behavioral and motivational basis. In this way, drugs may 
have both physiological and psychological motivational aspects.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Behaviourism also explains the importance of cues that trigger 
sequences of thinking and acting, such as when the heroin addict sees a needle 
or when an alcoholic sees an advert for vodka.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Personality</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">Aspects of personality have been linked to addiction, for 
example Eysenck and Eysenck, (1985) suggest there are three major and 
independent personality dimensions: P (psychoticism), N (neuroticism), and E 
(extraversion). Further research has shown dependence correlating when both N 
and P are high, although this still does not prove cause and effect.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Choice</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">We are, at least in part, rational beings and can make logical 
choices. People 'in sound mind' do choose to take drugs or indulge in other 
harmful activity. This has been investigated found that a tendency to focus on 
the near future more than the uncomfortable more distant future can be a factor 
and has been labelled 'cognitive myopia' (Hermstein and Prelec, 1992).</p>
<p ALIGN="left">This effect may be moderated by the way that we tend to weight 
the near future more highly than the more distant future (Ainslie, 1992).</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Effective forgetting the pain of past indulgences is also an 
effect as addicts focus on the near-term benefits. </p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Willpower</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">The ability to overcome cravings and compulsions can depend on
<a href="../../../techniques/willpower/willpower.htm">willpower</a> in general 
and <a href="../../../techniques/willpower/self-control.htm">self-control</a> in 
particular. An addictive personality may have high tendency towards experiencing 
desires and a low ability to resist them. When a person seems not to be 
addictive, they may have low tendency to desire or have a sufficiently high 
self-control to manage those desires, keeping fulfilment of them to acceptable 
levels and situations. </p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Cascade</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">There has been some linkage between drugs, for example where a 
person who is drunk is more likely to accept other drugs. In particular nicotine 
has been shown to be a gateway to other substance abuse (although of course many 
smokers do not indulge in illicit substances).</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Context</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">There are many contextual factors that can lead to addiction, 
including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="left">Antisocial behavior</p></li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="left">Anxiety and depression</p></li>
  <li>
  <p ALIGN="left">The influence of peers</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Relapse</h3>
<p>A person who has given up the addictive substance/behavior may relapse into 
addiction again. This can be caused by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Indulging again (even once)</li>
  <li>Appearance of a conditioned stimulus</li>
  <li>Stressful event (whereby the comfort of the addiction is sought)</li>
</ul>
<p>The danger of relapse can continue indefinitely, for example where smokers 
easily take up smoking again long after they have 'given up', and particularly 
where the craving never fully goes away. </p> 
<h3>Addiction vs. compulsion</h3>
<p>Compulsive disorders are sometimes seen as addictions, yet psychologists 
often separate them, though the boundary can be rather fuzzy even for 
psychologists. For example in Obsessive Buying Disorder (or 'shopaholic' to most 
of us) is often considered to not be an addiction, although this is sometimes 
differentiated as 'Behavioral Addiction' in contrast to 'Drug Addiction'. </p>
<p>A compulsion is perhaps more of a ritual that has few goals other than 
performance of the behavior (such as counting things), as opposed to an 
addiction, which has a more specific end in mind (such as pleasurable feelings). 
Addiction is more about harmful behavior. Both have physiological and 
psychological elements.</p>
<p>Addicts feel compulsion and those who have compulsive disorders may well seem 
addicted. Both are about a lack of control. And they can overlap: a study has 
shown that a significantly larger number of alcoholics had suffered compulsive 
disorders than would be found in the normal population.</p>
<p>In the end, it is as much about definition as anything. There are clear drug 
addicts and obsessive-compulsive disorders. It all gets a bit gray, though, when 
you get to gambling and shopping.</p>
