<p class="smaller" align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sometimes it seems people are either persecutors or victims. But sometimes 
they are both. And they can be either.</p>
<h2><a name="per"></a>Persecutor thinking</h2>
<p>Persecutors are the bullies of life. They may not think of themselves that way, 
but this is how they act as they belittle others in pursuit of their personal 
goals. </p>
<p>Persecutors enjoy the sense of <a href="../../needs/control.htm">control</a> 
from their actions. They enjoy <a href="../../power/power.htm">
power</a> for its own sake, in the way a miser loves gold. They like to consider 
themselves superior, with a higher social <a href="../../needs/status.htm">
status</a>.</p>
<p>Persecutors may well have <a href="../../belief/belief_about_people.htm">
beliefs about people</a> that say 'it's a dog-eat-dog world, you have to fight 
to survive'. A tough, deprived upbringing could support this. Yet there are many 
wealthy persecutors also.</p>
<p>The winner-or-loser attitude leads persecutors to conclude that if they do 
not act in such dominant ways then others will do the same to them, making them 
the victim. They see 
life as a pecking-order and that they are either going up or going down this 
essential hierarchy. </p>
<p>Persecution of others not holds back the victims, ensuring they stay lower on 
the social order, it also sends a tiger message to others who might try to make 
the persecutor a victim. 'Do not persecute me', it says, 'I am strong and will 
make you a victim'. </p>
<p>Persecution can also be seen as the persecutor
<a href="../../../disciplines/psychoanalysis/concepts/projection_introjection.htm">
projecting</a> their bad feelings onto the victim, who is
<a href="../../theories/objectification.htm">objectifed</a>, turned into an 
impersonal 'thing' that can be attacked without transgressing common
<a href="../../values/values.htm">values</a>.</p>
<p>In this way, persecutors are often terrified of being victims and may take to 
persecution largely to hide their very real sense that they are themselves a 
victim in some way. Quite possibly, they were victimized when they were younger 
and are either running away from this and punishing the victim as a substitute 
for their former selves (or, perversely, maybe their own persecutors). It is in 
this complex system of reversals that the persecutor-victim paradox may be 
found.</p>
<h2><a name="vic"></a>Victim thinking</h2>
<p>Persecutors need victims. Victims are the object of the persecutors' 
attention. It is by comparing themselves with the victim that the persecutor 
knows they are superior. </p>
<p>Perversely and controversially, persistent victims also need persecutors, 
although they seldom think of it in this way. When persecuted, a victim can 
absolve themselves of responsibility for their lives, blaming all the bad things 
on their persecutor. They can excuse lack of personal effort and achievement, citing 
how the persecutor is ruling their lives, preventing them from doing anything. 
If the persecutor is not actually doing this, the victim can blame more general 
things, such as 'stress'.
</p>
<p>In other words, victims can regress and stay safely in a child state, where 
they are responsible for nothing and where adults are to be feared and obeyed, 
yet who will also provide in some way. This unwritten benefit that victims gain 
is another part of the paradox.</p>
<p>Victims can also engage in unwitting <a href="../games/games.htm">games</a> 
such as <a href="../games/poor_me_game.htm">Poor Me</a> or
<a href="../games/save_me_game.htm">Save Me</a>. Perhaps the most common game 
that gets played is the <a href="../games/drama_triangle.htm">Drama Triangle</a>, 
where the victim is 'saved' by a rescuer. </p>
<p>People can become locked in their victim mentality as much as the persecutors 
feel they must continue their role. This does not mean that victims are happy 
people. In fact, they are likely to unhappy. They see no other way and gain 
enough succor to stay sufficiently satisfied with their lot. Like many people, 
when they are not unhappy enough to change, the momentum of the current state 
persists.</p>
<p>People can stay victims all of their life. They can be seen in the battered 
spouses who never leave, the people at work who like to complain as they seek 
sympathy but who do nothing to change their circumstances, and those who almost 
deliberately become 'losers' and never really try to achieve their potential.</p>
<p>Victims typically see life as being either victim or persecutor and so may 
become persecutors, for example as children grow and feel stronger. There are 
many stories of the 'worm who turned' as the victim summons up the courage and 
stands up to their persecutor. Surprised at their success, they may press home 
their advantage and so flip into a persecutor state. </p>
<p>What must not be forgotten in this patterning is that the victim is often an 
unwilling and unhappy participant and may as much a victim of circumstance as of 
the persecutor. To blame the victim for their position is to misunderstand. The 
persecutor deserves far more blame, although, paradoxically, they also may feel 
trapped.</p>
<p>Remember also that 'victim thinking' here is about repeated patterns that 
trap people into a state of mind that perpetuates victimhood. It does not 
reflect infrequent situations where people become victims because they are in 
the wrong place at the wrong time.&nbsp; </p>
<h2><a name="ste"></a>Stepping sideways</h2>
<p>Stuck in the patterns of victim and persecutor, as a surprising number of 
people are, it can seem that there are only two choices in life, and perhaps 
that some are fated to live in just one of these whilst others have some fortune 
or capability to gain superiority.</p>
<p>What is missed in this dilemma is that there are alternatives. When you see 
life of black, you can miss other shades. And when the shades are just points 
along the gray from black to white, the potential for the whole spectrum of 
color may be missed.</p>
<p>It is possible to get off the persecutor-victim treadmill and step 
sideways into many other roles where the person is neither. Perhaps surprisingly 
and perhaps not, this realization can be quite a revelation to many.</p>
<p><a href="../ta.htm">Transactional Analysis</a> (TA) brings in the notion of 
the parent and child states that are in all of us, including where the adult 
becomes persecutor and the child the victim state. TA deliberately adds the 
intervening adult state, which is neither adult nor child, and neither 
persecutor nor victim. Adults stand up to bullies, but will not seek revenge. 
They <a href="../../../techniques/assertiveness/assertiveness.htm">assert</a> 
their rights and act with independence and humanity.</p>
<p>Helping those who are being bullied and also those who are doing the bullying 
often means moving them sideways into this alternative universe. It means 
helping them find a more fulfilling life where they can be far more than victim 
or bully. In effect, it is about helping them grow up.</p>
