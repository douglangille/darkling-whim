<p>As humans, it seems we are natural and compulsive liars. Most people tell 
some kind of lies every day. Of course some are more serious than others, but in 
many instances it is not seen as being very bad.</p>

<h2><a name="our"></a>Helping ourselves</h2>
<p>A very common reason to lie is in order to help ourselves in some way. This 
can be psychological, supporting the ego, or substantive, gaining material 
benefit. A matrix of how such actions may be understood is shown and described 
below:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Avoiding punishment</h3>
<p>Lying often starts with wrong-doing. For whatever reason, we do something 
that others disapprove of. When they are in a position of greater 
<a href="../../power/power.htm">power</a>, they 
might punish us. Even if not, their disapproval may be punishment enough. </p>
<p>In consequence, we deny the crime, pointing the finger at others, denying the 
action or justifying the act with some fabricated excuse.</p>
<h3>Avoiding embarrassment</h3>
<p>When others might not directly punish us, embarrassment is a powerful form of 
self-inflicted punishment, where we <a href="../../theories/theory_of_mind.htm">
imagine what others are thinking</a> and assume 
they are silently disapproving.</p>
<p>The implied loss of <a href="../../needs/esteem.htm">esteem</a> and social 
position that causes embarrassment is a powerful force on us, enough to make us 
lie to reduce the impact on our social position.</p>
<h3>Gaining advantage</h3>
<p>Lying can also be used more directly, for material gain. If, by telling fibs, 
you can negotiate a lower price or get things for no cost, then telling untruth 
may seem worthwhile.</p>
<p>There are many ways that we lie to gain advantage, for example:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Romance</i>: A man telling tales of his sporting prowess in order to 
	gain romantic admiration.</li>
	<li><i>Sales</i>: A car sales person saying there is nothing wrong with the 
	wreck they are selling.</li>
	<li><i>Reward</i>: A child saying she has done her homework in order to get 
	taken to the movies. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Gaining esteem</h3>
<p>The 
flip-side of embarrassment is to gain the admiration of other people and so a specific advantage we seek 
when lying is for others to think well of us. </p>
<p>Impression-management is particularly common in social, romantic and work 
situations, where we need others to think we are competent and successful in 
order to get their approval and the subsequent rewards they can give. Lying in 
order to make oneself look good is particularly common in job interviews, where 
'<a href="../../../disciplines/job-finding/resume/resume.htm">resume</a> 
inflation' is particularly common.</p>
<h2><a name="oth"></a>Helping others</h2>
<p>A more socially acceptable, desirable and even necessary reason for lying is 
to help others, particularly your friends and family. </p>
<p>Sometimes, however, we use this as an excuse, telling ourselves we are lying 
for others when we really are gaining as much or more more benefit for 
ourselves, such as avoiding embarrassment.</p>
<h3>White lies</h3>
<p>Sometimes we avoid telling things to other people more for their benefit than 
ours. For example saying you are feeling fine when you know it would upset a 
friend if you said you have serious illness. <a href="white_lies.htm">White lies</a> are also often used in 
face-saving.</p>
<h3>Face-saving</h3>
<p>'Face' is a term used to indicate the public respect given to a person. 
'Saving face' is hence a term for helping them to sustain the esteem of others 
and to avoid embarrassment. Different <a href="../../culture/culture.htm">
cultures</a> have very specific rules about what face-saving is needed and how 
it should be done.</p>
<p>One way we help others to save face is more about not telling the truth 
rather than overtly lying. If we meet a person with bad breath, for example, 
most would avoid pointing out this problem. </p>
<p>Beyond being 'economical with the truth', the lies we tell to save face may 
be couched in euphemisms and other vague statements as we try to help others 
feel good whilst also seeking to avoid telling big lies ourselves.</p>
<h3>Supporting friends</h3>
<p>Another way we tell lies is more directly in helping others avoid trouble, 
for example when we give them an alibi, saying they were with us rather than in 
some other compromising situation. At the most extreme, we might even commit 
perjury, lying in court to save our friends.</p>
<p>The extent to which we lie for others is often determined by local 
<a href="../../culture/culture.htm">culture</a>. 
In some parts of the world, it would be considered only right that a person 
lies, even in court, to save their friends. In other places, such as Northern 
Europe and North America, there is much greater concern to be truthful, 
especially in a legal situation.</p>
<h2><a name="lea"></a>Learning to lie</h2>
<p>We are not born liars, although we most certainly do have the mental 
faculties and inclination for deceit, to the point where we are known as the '<a href="../../evolution/mendacious_ape.htm">mendacious 
ape</a>'. </p>
<h3>Childhood escapes</h3>
<p>Young children learn fast about what works and what does not work. Lacking 
the physical ability to get what they want, they discover natural guile and soon 
start lying in order to avoid punishment, receive rewards and get their siblings 
into trouble.</p>
<p>Early deceits are obvious, such as when a child holds something behind their 
back as they say they do not have it. Before long, however, they learn to hide 
it somewhere else and put on a surprised and insulted look when their parents 
dare accuse them of wrong-doing. In fact when children are punished for lying, 
rather than doing it less, they often just get better they get at it.</p>
<h3>Justifying stories</h3>
<p>Rather than directly lie, another approach is to use
<a href="../../../techniques/conversation/excusing/justification_excuse.htm">
justification</a> as a method of accepting that something has happened but 
showing that it was the best alternative course of action in the situation. </p>
<p>When blame is difficult to dodge, children will quickly make up
<a href="../../../disciplines/storytelling/storytelling.htm">stories</a> that 
justify how they have behaved. Pinnochio-like, these can quickly become 
elaborated to cover the challenges they get, using their natural creativity to 
help weave elaborate yet credible tales.</p>
<h3>Little deceits</h3>
<p>Given the chance to deceive without being detected, most people will, in 
fact, deceive in small ways. This is reflected in the common debate about 
stealing office supplies from the workplace. Whilst many would never contemplate 
stealing computers, taking a pen home seems quite reasonable.</p>
<p>The same effect happens with lying. Small lies and little deceits are seen as 
being acceptable, which in many social circles they are.</p>

<h1><a name="so"></a>So what?</h1>

<p>Understand the reasons why people lie and use this in detecting deception.</p>
<p>If you are trying to get to the truth with someone who may be lying, you can 
help them justify their actions by saying how reasonable it is to avoid 
embarrassment, and so on. You can also help reduce the significance of the act, 
helping them see it as a 'little deceit' that is not worth defending.</p>
<p>If you are a parent, help your children adopt the value that lying is bad 
rather than punishing them for lies. Likewise if you are a manager, praise your 
people for telling the truth and they will lie and cover up less.</p>
