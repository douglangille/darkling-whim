<h1>Detecting Lies</h1>

&gt; <a href="lying.htm">Lying</a> &gt; Detecting Lies</p>

<p class="smaller" align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lying is a widespread phenomenon which we all do to some extent. If you are 
working with others, it is often very useful to be able to spot the fibs.</p>
<p>Remember in all this that one indicator is seldom enough. You should watch 
both for <i>clusters</i> of behaviors and <i>synchronisation</i> of behaviors with what is 
being said.</p>
<p>Also remember that a lot of the body language associated with lying is the 
same as that which indicates stress. People feel stressed for a range of 
reasons, not just because they fear being found out when they lie.</p>
