<a href="#foc">Focus: Narrow vs. Wide</a> | <a href="#dec">Decision: Rational 
vs. Emotional</a> | <a href="#con">Control: Manage vs. Adapt</a> | <a href="#so">So what?</a></p>

<p class="smaller" align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href="mbti.htm">Jungian Type Inventory</a> model, used by instruments 
such as the Myers-Briggs Type Inventory (MBTI) and the Keirsey Type Sorter, uses 
some fairly impenetrable naming that are based in history rather than&nbsp; 
being designed to help understand what they are all about.</p>
<p>Here, then, is a suggestion for perhaps more appropriate names for the four 
dimensions, along with a view on what the dimensions really mean.</p>
<h2><a name="ide"></a>Identity: Outer vs. Inner</h2>
<h3>Original</h3>
<p>MBTI classes this dimension as being about 'energy', but this is a rather 
confusing term. What, psychologically, is 'energy'. We may feel energized or 
drained, but what is the underlying psychological principle? </p>
<p>Jungian models name the first variable as <a href="extravert_introvert.htm">
Extraversion vs. Introversion</a>. In this, the extravert seeks energy in social 
situations, interacting with others. The introvert, on the other hand finds 
parties exhausting and 'recharges their batteries' by having time alone. </p>
<p>A confusion about this naming is that many understand 'extraversion' as 
meaning 'loud' and 'introversion' as 'shy', yet introverts often have many 
friends while extraverts are seldom brash.</p>
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>An alternative view is to consider this to be about how a person gets their 
sense of self, of who they are, their <a href="../identity/identity.htm">
identity</a>. Identity is a deep human need and much of what we do is to build 
and support it. </p>
<p>We gain identity more through <i>outer</i> means through paying attention to 
how others view us, hence socially constructing our selves.
<a href="../theories/social_identity.htm">Social Identity Theory</a> describes 
how we gain identify from a group. In the
<a href="../theories/looking-glass_self.htm">Looking-glass Self</a>, we see 
ourselves more through the eyes of others.</p>
<p>With an inner construction of the self, we spend more time reflecting and 
thinking about who we want to be, rather than worrying about how others view us. 
This gives the benefit of greater independence, but at the price of lower social 
acceptance.</p>
<p>We very largely use both inner and outer means to construct our identity. The 
useful question that this dimension brings up is the <i>extent </i>to which we 
depend on others rather than our independent thoughts.</p>
<h2><a name="foc"></a>Focus: Narrow vs. Wide</h2>
<h3>Original</h3>
<p>In the Jungian model, this dimension is about our approach to data and 
information, although the curiously-named dimensions of
<a href="sensing_intuiting.htm">Sensing vs. Intuiting</a> give little indication 
of this.</p>
<p>In paying attention to information, sensors seek detail while intuitors look 
to the big pictures. Sensors prefer facts, while intuitors prefer ideas.</p>
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>When looking around us, we have two zones of focus, a very narrow zone of 
attention around the size of a coin, and a broad area that reaches out to the 
periphery of our vision. This dual focus has evolved to allow animals to see 
threats while they pay close attention to an object of special interest.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Focus is a function of brain hemisphere, with a narrow focus associated with 
the left brain and a wider focus coming from the right brain. This is in slight 
contrast to the traditional view of left brain being logical and right brain 
being creative, although these are still explained quite well by narrow-wide 
focus.</p>
<p>Just because we have a preference for narrow or wide viewpoints, this does 
not mean we ignore the other perspective. The key is where we start, with close 
attention to the detail or the big picture. People who prefer a close focus 
build up to the big picture while those who start from the top break downwards. 
And when both perspectives are combined, we start from the middle and work 
outwards.</p>
<h2><a name="dec"></a>Decision: Rational vs. Emotional</h2>
<h3>Original</h3>
<p>The classic Jungian typologies also frame this as decision-making, which 
continues to make sense. The naming of the dimension as
<a href="thinking_feeling.htm">Thinking vs. Feeling</a> is also relatively close 
to the suggested alternative, although there is an implication about 'feeling' 
that there is no thinking involved or connected more with empathy and other 
people.</p>
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>In making decisions, we use both logic and emotion, thinking and feeling. In 
structure, although we may think we make a logical decision, the point of 
decision has a significant emotional component. We feel that we have thought 
enough and we </p>
<p>With a rational approach, the focus is on the thinking process that <i>leads 
up to </i>the point of decision, while with an emotional focus the decision 
itself is where the focus is, with attention to how it feels as a guide to the 
decision. Certainly, a focus on feeling will more likely take other emotional 
components into account, including social issues involving other people. The 
rational approach, on the other hand, seeks that which is correct and truthful, 
with less attention to <a href="../values/values.htm">values</a> and what is 
good and 'right'.</p>
<h2><a name="con"></a>Control: Manage vs. Adapt</h2>
<h3>Original</h3>
<p>In MBTI, this dimension is, perhaps confusingly, spoken of as being to do 
with 'lifestyle' and 'how you live'. The dimensions of
<a href="judging_perceiving.htm">Judging vs. Perceiving</a> are also confusing. </p>
<p>Judging seems to be evaluative and more about decisions based on rules or 
superior status. It is described as being about structuring and planning one's 
life, rather than letting things happen.</p>
<p>Perceiving seems to be about inferred personal meaning rather than fact. It 
is described as being around acting and making decisions when it becomes 
necessary rather than doing things ahead of times.</p>
<p>Judgers and perceivers may view each other with disdain or irritation as they 
see the other approach as foolish and impractical. Judgers see perceivers as 
chaotic while perceivers see judgers as spending time that may be wasted.</p>
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>We all have a need for a sense of <a href="../needs/control.htm">control</a>, 
which is perhaps even deeper than the need for a sense of identity (as it is 
related to basic survival). Note that is a 'sense' of control, which is based in 
how we feel rather than actually having control. This leads to two views on how 
to get that sense: to pre-emptively control </p>
<p>Those who try to manage the situation believe the best approach is to gain 
control and retain control. They plan carefully and then continuously manage the 
situation in order to ensure their plans happen as intended.</p>
<p>Those who adapt believe that it is impractical and a waste of energy to try 
to manage every situation, so they keep an eye on things, navigating and nudging 
events as they adapt to the world rather than expecting the world to adapt 
itself to their desires. They decide what they want based on what happens rather 
than first wanting and then trying to </p>
<p>It can be said that adapters succeed more, as success is meeting desires and 
they change their desires as well we their actions. Adapters may also be more 
collaborative as they cope with the needs of others and so may achieve things 
where managers fail as they try to bulldoze people in their way. It may also be 
said that managers are more successful at creating significant change and 
achieving ambitious goals. </p>

<h1><a name="so"></a>So what?</h1>
<p>Use the updated view as a way both to revise your understanding of the 
Jungian type model and also as a way to work differently with other people. </p>
