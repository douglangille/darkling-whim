</p>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are <a href="lightness_variants.htm">number of ways of describing tone</a> 
(the black and white part of an image). There are also a number of terms used 
when talking about color.</p>
<h2><a name="col"></a>Colorfulness</h2>
<p>Colourfulness is &#39;the attribute of a visual sensation according to which the 
perceived color of an area appears to be more or less chromatic&#39;. In other 
words, something that is more colorful has more color, and vice versa. 
Colorfulness is a general term used to indicate more or less color, in 
particular in what is <i>perceived</i> (rather than a physical attribute). An 
area which is not colorful is colorless.</p>
<p>A color with high luminance and low saturation has low colorfulness. A color 
with high saturation and low luminance also has a low colorfulness. A color with 
high colorfulness has high saturation and high luminance.</p>
<p>Colorfulness may be calculated as 2 x Saturation x Luminance. From Red, Green 
and Blue, it may be calculated thus:</p>
<ul>
	<li>min = the minimum value of Red, Green and Blue (all between 0 and 1)</li>
	<li>max = the maximum value of Red, Green and Blue</li>
	<li>Colorfulness = ((max + min) x (max - min))/max</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="hue"></a>Hue</h2>
<p>Hue is &#39;attribute of a visual sensation according to which an area appears to 
be similar to one of the perceived colors of red, yellow, green, and blue, or to 
a combination of two of them&#39;. More simply, it is the color in the visible 
spectrum that is perceived. </p>
<p>Physically, hue corresponds to the wavelength (or frequency) of the 
electromagnetic beam light used. A complication is that there are often multiple 
electromagnetic light waves at multiple wavelengths present at the same time. 
These simply mix to form the final perceived hue.</p>
<p>In photo editing, Hue is important for <a href="hsl.htm">Hue, Saturation and 
Luminosity (HSL)</a> adjustment. Changing Hue in an image can be used for 
correcting or creating a color cast, tinting the image with a particular hue.</p>
<h2><a name="sat"></a>Saturation</h2>
<p>Saturation is the extent to which an area lacks gray and is a pure color. 
Areas increase in gray as Red, Green and Blue all tend towards having the same 
level. Saturation hence increases as Red, Green and Blue become more separated. 
In particular as the gap between maximum and minimum values within these becomes 
greater. Desaturating an image turns it to monochrome, or black and white.</p>
<p>In photo editing, saturation is calculated as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>First identify the normalized Red, Green and Blue values (0 to 1, 
	typically R/255, G/255 and B/255)</li>
	<li>Identify the maximum (max) and minimum (min) of these.</li>
	<li>If max = 0 then the color is black (Red, Green and Blue are all zero) and Saturation is zero.</li>
	<li>Calculate the Luminosity as (max - min).</li>
	<li>the Luminosity of a pixel is the range between the minimum and maximum 
	values of Red, Green and Blue.</li>
	<li>If Luminosity is less than 0.5 then Saturation = (max - min) / (max + 
	min)</li>
	<li>If Luminosity is greater than 0.5 then Saturation = (max - min) / (2 - max 
	- 
	min)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="vib"></a>Vibrance</h2>
<p>Vibrance is a term that is used in photo editing, where there is often a &#39;vibrance&#39; 
control. This acts on areas that are less saturated than other areas, raising 
their saturation such the image becomes more saturated overall. This can both 
help lift a dull picture and also lead to an unrealistic, over-saturated 
picture. </p>
<p>In other words, vibrance is a useful tool, but should be used in moderation 
rather than with wild enthusiasm. Saturated colors tend to grab the eye, and 
with many strongly saturated areas, the eye does not know where to look, leading 
to visual confusion and exhaustion.</p>
<h2><a name="chr"></a>Chrominance</h2>
<p>Chrominance is the quality of light that causes the perception of color. It 
is often described as the &#39;color&#39; partner of the black-and-white Luminance.</p>
<p>Chroma is a term used to describe chrominance when it is held as an 
electronic signal. Chroma may be broken into two orthogonal signals, which ma 
vary depending on the encoding scheme used.</p>
<p>In a video signal, the color information is send via the chrominance, or 
chroma signal. Chrominance is often signified by C, while Luminance is signified 
by Y. Chroma signals are typically highly compressed (Chroma Sampling), using 
far less of the full hue information than might have been first captured. This 
is because the human eye likewise compresses color and video follows the same 
principles.</p>
<h2><a name="city"></a>Chromaticity</h2>
<p>Chromaticity is a term used to describe the combination of hue and saturation 
as a single appearance of color. In the manner of the <a href="hsl.htm">HSL</a> 
model, This means Chromaticity can be paired with Luminance/Lightness (or 
however the model describes monochrome brightness) to provide a complete color 
signal.</p>
<h2><a name="tem"></a>Color Temperature</h2>
<p>A light that is not white will make white things appear to be of the color of 
the light, and similarly change the appearance of other items. The idea of &#39;color 
temperature&#39; comes from the theoretical temperature that a black body radiator 
(which absorbs all electromagnetic radiation) needs to be 
in order to glow with the given color. This is measured in degrees Kelvin (K).&nbsp; 
This can be quite hot in order to light up. Zero degree Celsius, is 273K. 
Thereafter, one degree increase in Kelvin is the same as one degree increase in 
Celsius.</p>
<p>Color Temperature is a measure of the overall hue in ambient light. A 
tungsten bulb casts an orange light and is typically around 2500K. Daylight, 
which we commonly call &#39;white&#39; is typically taken to be 5500K.&nbsp; On a cloudy 
day, the color temperature may be around 6500K.</p>
<p>Cameras often can be set to compensate for the color temperature. Settings to 
compensate for include daylight, cloud, shade, tungsten, fluorescent and flash. 
Cameras may also compensate automatically, picking what seems to be white and 
changing the setting to account for this.</p>
<p>Image editors allow adjustments of color temperature, often within &#39;White 
Balance&#39;, either &#39;cooling&#39; towards more blue or &#39;warming&#39; towards more orange. A 
common technique to suggest a sunset is simply to warm up the picture.</p>
<p>White balance adjustment may also include a tint adjustment, shifting the 
overall color between more magenta and more green.</p>
<h2><a name="rgb"></a>RGB</h2>
<p>Colors in computer processing are usually held as a combination of values of 
Red, Green and Blue for each pixel. Typically, in an 8-bit data scheme, each of 
these can range from 0 to 255. For example, Red=0 means &#39;no red in color&#39; and 
Red=255 means (in 8-bit color) &#39;maximum, full-saturated, red&#39;. For calculations, these 
values are often normalized to a 
range between 0 and 1 (calculated as Red/255, Green/255 and Blue/255). You can also use 
any number of bits for each RGB color, for example 12, 14, 16, 20, 24 or 32 
bits. To normalize these to 0 to 
1, again we simply divide by the maximum value they can have.</p>
<p>When Red, Green and Blue values are equal to one another, then the resultant 
color is gray. When they are all zero, the result is black, and when they are 
all 1 then the result is white. Hence, in an 8-bit color scheme, you can have 
values of 0 to 255, giving 
256 black/white shades, which are normalized to the range from 0 to 1. In a 
16-bit scheme, each RGB color can have 65536 shades, which can be normalized to 
the range 0 to 1 (by dividing by 65535). This gives many more color 
possibilities than 8-bit color, but results in much bigger files and requires 
much more computer power to process.</p>
<h2><a name="cmy"></a>CMY</h2>
<p>When Red, Green and Blue are combined in pairs, they form the secondary 
colors, Cyan (Blue+Green), Magenta (Red+Blue) and Yellow (Red+Green). These are 
formed additively, which means they are combinations of light rather than paint 
(which gives a subtractive effect). Hence a Red light and Green light shone onto 
a black card will be seen as Yellow when they overlap.</p>
<p>Any hue can be created by a combination of Cyan, Magenta and Yellow. 
Importantly, CMY is used in printing, which is why printers often use Cyan, 
Magenta and Yellow ink cartridges. This is because a printed page is white and 
subtractive as it depends on reflected (rather than emitted) light. In other 
words, white light shines on the inked page and only the remains of this white 
light that is not absorbed by the ink is reflected. While a combination of Cyan, 
Magenta and Yellow should be seen as black, the result is often an imperfect 
dark, which is why an additional Black ink cartridge is often added to fix this 
problem.</p>

<h1><a name="So"></a>So what?</h1>
<p>Understand how color works and then use it to your advantage. Be careful with 
definitions of words and check with other people as needed to ensure you are 
both using the same definition.</p>
