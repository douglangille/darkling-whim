</p>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Height is a curiously pervasive metaphor that affects many of our decisions 
without us realizing it. </p>
<h2><a name="hei"></a>Height as threat </h2>
<p>When one person is taller than another, they are more likely to win a fight. 
They have a longer reach and the length of their limbs makes a wide swinging 
punch more painful. They can rain blows down on us that are hard to defend 
against (and if we raise our arms we expose our torsos). Human height also 
implies reach, so a taller person can reach a smaller person who cannot reach 
back.</p>
<p>We know instinctively the threat from taller people, and, while our civilized 
world means we can walk out safely, we cannot help but be cautious around them.
</p>
<p>We may also be cautious around tall things that may fall on us, from trees to 
rocky outcrops and anything above that seems unstable. Claustrophobia is a 
related fear where we feel enclosed spaces may collapse in on us. </p>
<p>Cowering, hunching down and lowering our heads, is an instinctive response to 
a height threat. If a branch from a tree feel on us, it is better to take it on 
the back rather than the head. The cower response can also be seen when people 
feel threatened by others. </p>
<p>Yet there are benefits to being smaller. A shorter person is less of a threat 
and may be challenged less. A smaller body needs less food and survives famines 
better. Shorter people are more agile and can hide more easily. A short body 
also has less gravitational force on it and shorter people are less liable to 
skeletal problems. </p>
<h2><a name="sup"></a>Height as superiority </h2>
<p>Generally, we consider high things to be better. Taller people on the whole 
are seen as more attractive and more persuasive, and they get more promotion. It 
is not only people. Tall buildings and high mountains are somehow better than 
the lower ones nearby. </p>
<p>When we feel superior, we look down on other people. We even do this 
literally, tilting our heads back so we can look down our noises and fool 
ourselves that we are taller than we really are. In research, powerful people 
were found to over-estimate their own height (and vice versa). </p>
<p>If you are not tall, being higher up helps. A king sits on a raised dais, 
indicating his superiority. SUVs let the owners look down on other drivers. 
Expensive penthouses are situated at the top of buildings. </p>
<p>Feeling inferior has the opposite effect as we hunch down and hold down our chins 
so we effectively look up at the other person. This is a classic flirting pose 
that says 'Oh you are so powerful'. It also appears in shame where a person 
lowers their status, taking a child position as they physically beg forgiveness.
</p>
<p>The inferiority that shorter people feel is compounded when others subtly act 
in superior ways, and they may over-compensate, becoming aggressive to cover up 
the inferiority they feel (this is known as the Napoleon Complex). </p>
<p>Height is also a relative thing, where a bit higher means a bit better and 
much higher is much better. The relative height metaphor can be seen in images 
of heaven and hell. Not only is heaven above and hell below, but heaven is so 
superior it is far above, and hell is so bad it is far below. In fact nothing is 
higher that heaven and nothing lower than hell. </p>
<p>When people feel confident, they straighten their backs, hold up their heads 
and 'stand tall'. Even if they are smaller than others they may feel taller. 
When we stand erect, we send a signal that we are unafraid. This may dissuade 
potential attackers. </p>
<p>To use physical height in changing minds, stand erect or get to a higher 
position, where others have to look up to you. Act confidently and they will 
think you even taller. </p>
<h2><a name="pro"></a>Height as protection </h2>
<p>The notion of height can make us feel safe as well as as fearful. When the 
higher thing is protective, when it is a shelter our nurturing parent, it feels 
comforting. </p>
<p>Evolution has made men generally taller than women and they are seen as more 
attractive mates, partly because they seem likely to offer more protection, for 
both her and her children. </p>
<p>Sheltering height an intermediate cover, an umbrella that protects us from 
something even higher. It enclosed us, like a womb. Our houses and beds are like 
this. While they have layers higher than us, they make us feel warm and safe as 
they hold back the higher threat. </p>
<p>Height as protection requires a deep trust, as the taller parent or house 
could come crashing down on us at a moment's notice, giving us no time for 
escape. Taller people hence need to be particularly gentle to avoid any threat 
response. </p>
<h2><a name="pos"></a>Height as positivity </h2>
<p>High can be a good thing, for example when we talk about things 'looking up', 
or when people talk about 'being on a high' (and not necessarily caused by 
ingested chemicals). At the opposite end of the scale, we talk about being 'on a 
downer'. It can even be seen in the way people gaze -- when they are depressed, 
for example, we are more likely to look downwards. </p>
<p>In such use, the vertical direction is used as a barometer of positive 
feelings. More generally this may even be a measure of arousal, so someone who 
is 'flat' is not feeling anything in particular. </p>
<p>When we are aroused we typically are happy being more visible to others, 
which physical height produces. When we are unhappy, we may physically hunch 
down in a way that others may not notice us. In this way, via happiness, height 
is also about social connection. </p>
<h2><a name="per"></a>Height as perspective </h2>
<p>When you are high up, you can see a long way. This gives a further metaphor 
for height which can be seen in talk about the'10000 foot view' or 'helicoptering' 
as a process of gaining a 'high level view'. </p>
<p>Built into this principle of a high level perspective is the trade-off of 
scale for detail. When you look down on something from above, you see the broad 
lay of the land and the relationship between large structures, but in doing so 
the finer details get lost as they merge together into a background texture. </p>
<p>The same effect happens in the metaphor, for example where upper management 
understands the high-level picture of their organizations, but miss the messy 
low-level detail. This can be a recipe for conflict when not seeing things leads 
to simplified and impractical assumptions. The reverse is also true as having 
your head in the weeds can blind you to the high-level strategy. </p>
<h2><a name="siz"></a>Height as size </h2>
<p>Height is only one of the three dimensions, but its significance for us is so 
great it is often the dominant dimension in determining overall size. When we 
say 'That is big!' we tend to mean it is tall. Children in particular easily 
measure volume using height disproportionately. Having said this we still use 
'big' to describe wide people, but only as a euphemism to avoid calling them 
fat. </p>
<p>This can be used in changing minds by emphasizing height when you want to 
emphasize amount. For example show a single, tall pile of money, rather than 
several smaller piles, to make it seem like a lot of money. And vice versa, of 
course. </p>
<h2><a name="int"></a>Height as intensity </h2>
<p>Height can also indicate intensity of some kind. This may often indicate 
emotion, but can indicate any other amplification. </p>
<p>We talk of high winds. People take narcotics to short cut to a sensory high. 
We say 'It's high time' that something happened. We note that people are highly 
regarded. </p>
<p>The physical feeling of being high can give a sense of exhilaration and 
wonder, such as when you stand atop a mountain. </p>
<p>Intensity increases emotion, even if the subject is not directly emotion. Any 
rising tone can do this, even a rising line, lifting feelings as it goes up. 
This can be used in changing minds to wind up and so engage the other person.
</p>
<h2><a name="lan"></a>Height in language </h2>
<p>Height appears in language that reflects the above metaphors. We talk about 
the upper class, people in high office, moving up the career ladder, and so on.
</p>
<p>Height words include: Above, below, low, high, highly, over, oversee, 
overhang, tall, up, and so on. </p>
<p>As above, you can use height words to show superiority, indicate strategic 
understanding and intensify emotions. </p>

<h1><a name="So"></a>So what?</h1>
<p>Stand tall when persuading others or at least sit erect. Being confident will 
also enhance the sense of your height, and standing tall will make you feel more 
confident. If you want to appear superior, tilt your head back and look down 
your nose (though beware of reactions to this). </p>
<p>Otherwise use the height metaphor whenever you want to achieve any of the 
above effects. </p>
