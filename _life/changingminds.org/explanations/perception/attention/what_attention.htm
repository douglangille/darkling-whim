</p>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p>What, exactly, is attention? We all know what it is from our own experience, 
and it is certainly important in changing minds. Without attention, others do 
not listen to what you say, let alone consider your suggestions.</p>
<h2><a name="he"></a>Heightened arousal</h2>
<p>To be awake and conscious is to have some kind of attention, either to the 
world around us or to our thoughts. We also have attention during the false 
consciousness of dreaming. 
In everyday life, attention is linked with <a href="../../needs/arousal.htm">arousal</a> 
as it cues this state in readiness for action. This may also create a state of 
intensity, where we put significant effort into attending (for example to a 
nearby threat or item of interest).</p>
<h2><a name="spo"></a>The spotlight</h2>
<p>William James' Spotlight model views attention as being like a torch, with a 
central focus, a margin and a fringe. An evolution of this is Eriksen and St. 
James' Zoom-Lens Model, which adds the ability to zoom in and zoom out, like a 
camera. </p>
<p>Interestingly, we can pay attention to things without pointing at them, for 
example where we notice an attractive person at a party and watch them covertly 
without staring at them. Despite this, we may still leak small cues that lets 
them know we are interested. This is how many romances have started.</p>
<p>Attention can also be a very broad light, for example where a martial artist 
spreads their attention to take in all movement around them. Prey also spread 
their attention wide, which is why they often have eyes on either side of their 
head in order to maximize their field of view. </p>
<h2><a name="lim"></a>Limited focus</h2>
<p>Attention is affected by our limited capacity. When we are attracted by 
something, there is competition with other items for further attention.</p>
<p>As we live there are many things that could take our attention at any moment, 
yet consciousness is a serial process that limits attention. We can hence only attend directly to very few 
things at a time (and are best when we are attending to one). Attention acts as 
a focus, helping us gain information about those things that might be of greater interest or 
importance for us. </p>
<p>The choice of where to attend may be automatic (as when responding to an 
attack) or a more thoughtful decision. We may cope with multiple demands by 
either switching between items (divided attention) or reducing the number of 
items to which we attend, often ideally to one.</p>
<p>Wickens&#8217; (1984) Multiple Resource Theory suggests that we have multiple 
(rather than one) pools of resource across senses, stages of perception and 
reasoning that we can use at the same time, allowing us to attend in complex 
ways. However we may still run out of these finite resources and so our 
attention is limited by our workload.</p>
<p>We are also limited by the duration and intensity of attention that we can 
use without drifting off or being distracted. Like the blinking of an eye, 
we often do not realize we have temporarily less attention than we intend. Jha et al (2007) showed 
that mindfulness training can increase our ability to sustain attention. This is 
perhaps unsurprising, given that mediation is very largely about attention.</p>
<h2><a name="att"></a>Attentive by design</h2>
<p>We are designed for visual attention. In the middle of the retina of the eye, 
which is the central point of our vision and the focus point of where we look, 
is the fovea centralis. This gives us sharp vision at our point of attention. 
Outside this, our vision becomes less detailed and, in the outer regions, black 
and white (though our brains fill in hues so we think we have full vision). When 
we are looking hard at something, we pay more attention to this central detail 
and ignore peripheral information. We can focus on other senses too, though this 
is done more by the brain.</p>
<p>This ability to ignore that which is not important and focus on that which is 
important is a very useful attribute that has evolved to a high degree in many 
species, which indicates its evolutionary value. Attention is also related to 
automatic action, such as when we block a punch without thinking too hard about 
it. </p>
<p>In humans, our consciousness and complexity lets us be more deliberate in our 
attending, though deeper factors still pull our attention away to more primitive 
cues.</p>
<h2><a name="sel"></a>Selective attention</h2>
<p>We have a remarkable ability to choose the things to which we pay attention 
and ignore those which are not important. We can even ignore pain when there is 
motivation to pay attention elsewhere (for example when we are fighting). Other 
examples include not hearing ticking clocks and the real world 'disappearing' 
when we are reading an engrossing novel. In what is called the 'Cocktail Party Effect' we are able to hear just one voice when many people are speaking. </p>
<p>There have been a number of models proposed to describe how we are able to 
pay attention to a limited part of our sensory input, effectively ignoring the 
rest, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Broadbent's (1958) Filter Model of attention in hearing suggests we have 
	a sensory buffer that stores inputs, from which we select items for further 
	attention, based on physical characteristics of the received information. In 
	this way we can listen to information from one ear, ignoring that from the 
	other ear. </li>
	<li>Treisman's (1964) Attenuation Model is similar to Broadbent's, but 
	suggests we attenuate rather than eliminate unwanted information. It is as 
	if we have a volume control that can turn down things we do not want to 
	hear.</li>
	<li>Treisman and Gellade's (1980) Feature Integration Theory suggests that 
	attention attention acts to collate different features of an object into 
	distinct experiences. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="con"></a>Conscious or unconscious</h2>
<p>Attention can happen through conscious and unconscious routes, typically 
being driven automatically by external events or by our deliberate 
choices (Theeuwes, 1991).</p>
<p>In stimulus-driven attention (also known as bottom-up or exogenous 
attention), we are unconsciously forced to pay attention to an external event. 
This is typically something unusual that could be a threat. Evolution has taught 
us that attention to such events could save our lives.</p>
<p>In Goal-driven attention (also known as top-down, endogenous, attentional 
control or executive attention), we consciously choose to pay attention to 
things of interest. Typically these are related to things of general or specific 
importance to us. For example I have a general interest in cars, so will pay 
attention to adverts for cars. I may have a specific interest in lions and will 
go out of my way to visit a zoo to spend much time with them.</p>
<h2><a name="int"></a>Internal or external</h2>
<p>A particular separation of attention is between inner (endogenous) thoughts 
and outer (exogenous) experiences, as appear through our senses (Posner, 1980). 
When we sit in a meeting at work or just in the company of others, we may 
struggle to keep attention to people who are talking about things where we have 
little interest. As we drift off into internal thought, either thinking about 
the work topics, for example in formulating what we want to say, or daydreaming 
about other parts of our life.</p>
<p>By and large, external events can grab us more strongly than internal 
thoughts, although individuals spend more or less in their inner worlds as 
opposed to connecting with others and the world around them. External stimuli 
that grab attention can include loud noises, bright hues, unexpected events and 
so on. Internal events that grab attention include ideas, sudden thoughts and 
revelations.</p>
<h1><a name="So"></a>So what?</h1>
<p>Understand how attention works and then use it in the first step to gain 
attention to what you have to say. Then work to both gain it and sustain it.</p>
