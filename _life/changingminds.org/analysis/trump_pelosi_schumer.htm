<h1>Analysis and Improvements: Trump, Pelosi, Schumer and the Oval Office Address about the Border

<p>On 8th January, in the context of a US government partial shutdown and 
President Donald Trump refusing to sign off a budget until he gets $5B for a 
wall/fence on the southern US border with Mexico, President Trump escalated the 
row with the new Democrat-majority House by using a formal Oval Office Address 
to the Nation. Nancy Pelosi, House speaker, and Chuck Schumer, Democratic Senate 
Leader gave a subsequent reply. Here is the full text of each speech and a 
paragraph-by-paragraph analysis of what was said.</p>
<p>In summary, President Trump&#39;s speech was largely in his classic style, 
including the use of &#39;facts&#39; that often turn out to be untrue, frequent 
emotional intensifiers that act to reduce rational reflection, and preparation 
for subsequent action by declaring what &#39;needs to be done&#39;. For each 
paragraph, suggestions are offered for a more effective speech that may convince 
more people and make Trump seem more presidential.</p>
<p>The Democrat speeches were surprisingly weak, full of floppy words and 
qualifiers that reduce the impact of what they could say. For each of their 
paragraphs, a &#39;better&#39; alternative is suggested.</p>

			<td width="50%" valign="top">Tonight, I am speaking to you because 
			there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern 
			border. </td>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">Summarising the issue and context. Good 
			principle. Introduces &#39;crisis&#39;. Implication that humanitarian and security are both 
			equally important, though with &#39;humanitarian&#39; first, this 
			suggests that caring for others is a priority. Yet the text below speaks mostly to the security 
			issue.</td>

			<td width="50%" valign="top">Every day, customs and border patrol 
			agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our 
			country. We are out of space to hold them, and we have no way to

			<td width="50%" valign="top">Expanding the problem. &#39;thousands&#39; 
			means &#39;so many it is a big issue&#39;. &#39;trying&#39; means failing. &#39;out of 
			space&#39; signifies additional issue of holding. &#39;promptly&#39; modifies 
			meaning to actually say they <i>can </i>be returned, but not in the 
			short term. Yet an overall reading where &#39;promptly&#39; gets lost in the 
			words suggests a significant, urgent issue.<p>Generally, modifiers 
			such as &#39;promptly&#39; allows a qualified truth to be said, yet a 
			different meaning to be implied. Trump often uses such words in this 
			way.<p>The issue of holding migrants is not strongly related to the 
			wall and so is a distraction.<p>Better:<p>Every day, customs and border patrol 
			agents catch thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our 
			country. We must stop them coming in. And if they do, we must return 
			them promptly. We have no space left to hold them and, frankly, it 
			is not nice for them. </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">America proudly welcomes millions of 
			lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our 
			nation. But all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled, illegal 
			migration. It strains public resources and drives down jobs and 
			wages. Among those hardest hit are African Americans and Hispanic 
			Americans.</td>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">Nod to America being built on 
			immigration. Yet &#39;but&#39; negates or downplays a previous sentence. 
			&#39;all Americans&#39; means &#39;you&#39;. Migration is of course controlled 
			(America is one of the hardest countries to enter, even for 
			legitimate travellers).
			<p>&#39;drives down jobs and wages&#39; suggests any number of immigrants 
			will directly and significantly affect the livelihood of many 
			existing people. This is a disproportionate claim. Explicitly naming 
			&#39;African Americans and Hispanic Americans&#39; seems intended make 
			people in these communities fear for their jobs.<p>Better:<p>Our 
			great country is founded on legal immigration. People have come here 
			for centuries to contribute to our society and build their fortunes. 
			Illegal immigrants put an intolerable strain on our nation. They 
			take low-paid jobs from those of us who are starting their journey 
			towards the American Dream, casting good citizens by the wayside.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">Our southern border is a pipeline for 
			vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine, 
			and fentanyl. Every week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin 
			alone, 90% of which floods across from our southern border. More 
			Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the 
			entire Vietnam war. </td>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">This suggests (but does not explicitly 
			say) that 300 people a week are killed by drugs brought via the 
			southern border. Yet the route by which drugs enter is not named 
			(most come through legal routes). It 
			has been noted elsewhere that most comes via other routes such as 
			via air. Mentioning &#39;Vietnam&#39; adds a military tone.<p>Overall an 
			appeal to fear, which continues through many of the points below.<p>
			Better:<p>Drugs are killing us and most are brought by criminals 
			through our southern border. Every week, 300 of our citizens are 
			killed by heroin alone. More Americans will die from drugs this year 
			than were killed in the entire Vietnam war.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">In the last two years, ICE officers 
			made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including 
			those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, 
			and 4,000 violent killings. Over the years, thousands of Americans 
			have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our 
			country, and thousands more lives will be lost if we don’t act right 
			now.</td>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">Generally, quoting numbers makes 
			arguments seem more potent. Yet the detail of the numbers given is 
			not given, nor are crimes by immigrants compared with those by 
			nationals. No link to those illegally crossing the 
			border is made. Trump&#39;s exaggerations and untruths are so well known 
			now, such claims have less effect.<p>Emotional intensifiers are used liberally, such as 
			&#39;violent&#39; killings and &#39;brutally&#39; killed. As listeners are aroused 
			emotionally they will think less rationally and be less likely to 
			challenge logic. </p>
			<p>&#39;if we don&#39;t act right now&#39; brings urgency, perhaps seeking to 
			justify imminent action.<p>Better:<p>Illegal migrants have committed 
			many crimes, including assaults, sex crimes and homicide. We must 
			act now to keep our streets and homes safe.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">This is a humanitarian crisis – a 
			crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul. </td>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">&#39;crisis&#39; repeated three times for 
			emphasis. &#39;crisis of the heart and a crisis of 
			the soul&#39; is oddly out of place amongst the aggressive rhetoric, 
			perhaps appealing to religious listeners.<p>Better:</p>
			<p>This is a truly humanitarian crisis. People are being hurt by 
			illegal migrants and the many migrants who we must turn away must 
			know their attempts are futile and only hurt themselves and their 
			children.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">Last month, 20,000 migrant children 
			were illegally brought into the United States – a dramatic increase. 
			These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and 
			ruthless gangs. One in three women are sexually assaulted on the 
			dangerous trek up through Mexico. Women and children are the biggest 
			victims, by far, of our broken system. </td>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">Again, the route by which migrants of 
			any age arrive is not mentioned. Talk of children, &#39;vicious coyotes 
			and ruthless gangs&#39; and &#39;women are sexually assaulted&#39; again acts to 
			intensify emotional reaction.<p>&#39;broken system&#39; again suggests 
			imminent action, yet the problems highlighted are mostly about what 
			happens before people reach America.<p>Better:<p>Before they even 
			reach the border, women are being assaulted and children are being 
			exploited. The people who they pay to bring them here are ruthless. 
			They must know with certainty there is no illegal way in. The 
			current system we have is inadequate and broken. We must build an 
			impenetrable wall to stem this tide of human misery, dissuading 
			people from ever setting out on such futile treks.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">This is the tragic reality of illegal 
			immigration on our southern border. This is the cycle of human 
			suffering that I am determined to end. </td>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">&#39;reality&#39; suggests actual truth. 
			&#39;human suffering&#39; implies Trump sympathises with the plight of 
			migrants. &#39;determined to end&#39; is more presaging of action.<p>
			No change suggested.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">My administration has presented 
			Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the 
			criminal gangs, drug smugglers, and human traffickers. It’s a 
			tremendous problem. Our proposal was developed by law enforcement 
			professionals and border agents at the Department of Homeland 
			Security. These are the resources they have requested to properly 
			perform their mission and keep America safe. In fact, safer than 
			ever before. </td>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">&#39;detailed proposal&#39; is not clear -- the 
			main issue seems to be a wall. More intensifiers with &#39;criminal 
			gangs&#39; etc. &#39;developed by law enforcement professionals&#39; lends 
			credibility.<p>Better:</p>
			<p>My administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal 
			to secure the border along its whole length, not just on the roads. 
			This proposal has been developed by law enforcement professionals 
			and border agents at the Department of Homeland Security. This is 
			not an option. It is totally necessary.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">The proposal from Homeland Security 
			includes cutting-edge technology for detecting drugs, weapons, 
			illegal contraband, and many other things. We have requested more 
			agents, immigration judges, and bed space to process the sharp rise 
			in unlawful migration fuelled by our very strong economy. Our plan 
			also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and 
			medical support. </td>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">Here is the non-wall request. Numbers 
			and detail are not clear. The humanitarian aspect could also be 
			emphasized.<p>Better:</p>
			<p>We do not want just a wall, as Democrats would have you believe. 
			We also need cutting-edge technology for detecting drugs, weapons, 
			illegal contraband and more. We need more agents, judges and 
			doctors. And of course we need humane holding space where families 
			can be kept together and the values of our great country upheld. </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">Furthermore, we have asked Congress to 
			close border security loopholes so that illegal immigrant children 
			can be safely and humanely returned back home. </td>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">Not clear what these are. &#39;humanely&#39; is 
			a claim of being ethical.<p>No change suggested.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">Finally, as part of an overall approach 
			to border security, law enforcement professionals have requested 
			$5.7 billion for a physical barrier. At the request of Democrats, it 
			will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall. This barrier is 
			absolutely critical to border security. It’s also what our 
			professionals at the border want and need. This is just common 
			sense. </td>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">This is the real point of the speech - 
			the wall. Again the request is &#39;made&#39; by &#39;law enforcement 
			professionals&#39;. As the Democrats have requested steel rather than 
			concrete (have they?) it is implied that they agree with the 
			implementation of a barrier and the only real question is the 
			material. &#39;common sense&#39; claim suggests there is not really a 
			problem with the request (and that Democrats are consequently wholly 
			to blame for the current situation).&nbsp; 
			<p>Better:</p>
			<p>Our total approach to border security of course also needs what I 
			have called a wall, but in practice can be any effective barrier. In 
			consultation with experts we have determined that it will be made of 
			American steel. This common-sense measure will prevent all illegal 
			entry and dissuade potential illegal migrants from ever leaving 
			home. </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">The border wall would very quickly pay 
			for itself. The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500bn a year – vastly 
			more than the $5.7bn we have requested from Congress. The wall will 
			also be paid for, indirectly, by the great new trade deal we have 
			made with Mexico. </td>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">This suggests that (a) $500bn in drugs 
			enters via the border, (b) the wall will prevent this much drugs 
			from entering (hence somehow saving £500bn), and (c) the trade deal 
			with Mexico will also lead to an extra $5.7bn being gained from 
			them. All of these are highly questionable.<p>Better:</p>
			<p>The border wall and other measures I have described will pay for 
			itself. The massive reduction in illegal immigration will save us 
			greatly in other security costs. It will save the huge human misery 
			of drugs addiction. It will sharply cut violence. Don&#39;t forget that 
			we will also be gaining greatly from our new trade deal with our 
			friends in Mexico.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">Senator Chuck Schumer – who you will be 
			hearing from later tonight – has repeatedly supported a physical 
			barrier in the past, along with many other Democrats. They changed 
			their mind only after I was elected president.</td>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">This suggests Schumer and Democratic 
			opposition to the wall is purely political. What, exactly, did Schumer and others 
			support? A &#39;physical barrier&#39; is not the same as a $5.7bn wall.<p>
			Better:</p>
			<p>The Democrats don&#39;t like me. That&#39;s ok! I&#39;m a proud Republican 
			who supports our democracy. What is wrong, however, is that they are 
			making this personal. They are opposing our strong plan just because 
			they hate the fact that you elected me as your President. </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">Democrats in Congress have refused to 
			acknowledge the crisis. And they have refused to provide our brave 
			border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our 
			families and our nation.</td>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">Have they? They seem to support border 
			security but not huge expenditure on a wall.<p>&#39;brave&#39; and &#39;protect&#39; 
			intensify the principle of threat.<p>Better:<p>As I have shown you, 
			this is a crisis. A huge, painful crisis that will keep hurting 
			people until we act decisively to end it. Yet Democrats are refusing 
			to help, leaving our brave border people to cope with the 
			overwhelming tides of migration.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">The federal government remains shut 
			down for one reason and one reason only: because Democrats will not

			suggested change.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">My administration is doing everything

			<td width="50%" valign="top">It is unclear what is being done. &#39;The 
			only solution&#39; means &#39;the only solution I will accept&#39;. &#39;defends our 
			borders&#39; implies that the only solution is a wall.<p>Better:</p>
			<p>My administration and I are doing everything we can to help 
			everyone affected. But this needs money. All the Democrats need to 
			do is to pass a spending bill that defends our borders. Then we can

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">This situation could be solved in a

			<td width="50%" valign="top">Suggesting that resolution is easy - 
			the Democrats just need to approve $5.7bn for something they (and 
			others) see as an ineffective and hugely wasteful solution to a 
			known and accepted issue.<p>Better:</p>
			<p>We can solve this quickly and easily. I have invited

		<tr>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">Some have suggested a barrier is 
			immoral. Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences, and 
			gates around their homes? They don’t build walls because they hate 
			the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the 
			inside. The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do 
			nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly 
			victimized. </td>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">Talking of morality claims moral high 
			ground and hence superiority. &#39;wealthy politicians&#39; suggests that 
			his opponents are out of touch with ordinary people. &#39;love the 
			people on the inside&#39; implies not loving people on the outside - 
			which again is ordinary people.<p>Better:</p>
			<p>Some have suggested a barrier is immoral. Why? Do you not have 
			walls to your house and fences outside? Should we not protect our 
			civilized way of life from those who would just walk in and destroy 
			it? The only immorality is to prevent a barrier when it is so 
			obviously a moral need. </td>

		<tr>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">America’s heart broke the day after 
			Christmas when a young police officer in California was savagely 
			murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien, who just came across the

			no right to be in our country. </td>
			<td width="50%" valign="top">A single emotive case is used as
