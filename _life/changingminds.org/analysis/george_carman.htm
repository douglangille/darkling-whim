<h1>George Carman, QC</h1>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="analysis.htm">Analysis</a> &gt; 
George Carman, QC&nbsp;</p>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p>When George Carman died in 2001, he was the most famous and most feared
advocate in Britain, thus achieving his lifetime's goal.</p>

<h3>A peculiar private life</h3>

<p>He came from an ordinary background, unlike many other barristers who came
from a private-schooled, privileged background.</p>

<p>The young George took his early inspiration from the Blackpool theatres,
where he watched performers and stand-up comics holding their audiences in the
palms of their hands.</p>

<p>He was married three times, and controlled life very carefully, including a meticulous inspection of hair and nails before going out.</p>

<p>He was very nervous, even blacking out in court. He relieved his tensions in
rather seedy bars where he would fraternize with criminals and all sorts and it 
was said 'He
would drink with anybody.' He would come home drunk and violently abuse his
wife. He would never apologize later, being quite contrite about it.</p>

<p>He made a lot of money and lost it again at the casino tables. In one night,
he would lose an amount equivalent to the value of his house. 'He was not a bit
interested in money. When he lost the sixty thousand, he just shrugged.'</p>

<p>'He just didn't live outside of his head.'&nbsp;</p>

<p>'He had so much to give. Yet he was entirely self-destructive.'</p>

<h3>Defending Jeremy Thorpe</h3>

<p>In his first high-visibility case he defended Jeremy Thorpe, the political
leader who was 'outed' in the 60s (when being gay was something shocking and
only recently legalized) and who had apparently hired an assassin to kill a
blackmailer who claimed he had had sex with Thorpe (although only his dog was
hurt). He was 50, and just entering his prime.</p>

<p>For a very public client, he prevented them from taking the stand, speaking
in his stead in the closing speech. He took 5 weeks to write the speech. He
delivered it with aplomb, building it to a series of ever-escalating levels. He
pointed at each of them as he told them they had the most important power: to
find a fellow person guilty or not guilty.</p>

<h3>Defending the libel brought by Jani Allen against a newspaper</h3>

<p>Jani Allen was a South African 'liberated' journalist who purportedly had
an affair with a neo-Nazi leader.</p>

<p>'If you are going to take a libel action, then you had better make sure your
cupboard is free of skeletons.' </p>
<p>Defending against libel, he'd take the court by
surprise, stage-managing the exposé, bringing in papers by motorcycle courier at the
last minute.&nbsp;</p>

<p>'He would never hurry over these details. He would make one cringe at the
detail.' He would approach emotionally charged evidence in a clinical detail,
reading out a portion and asking if it was true or false, repeating this method
time and again. His witnesses, he would ask them one step at a time, and then
repeat what they said, slowly and carefully.</p>

<h3>Defending against Jonathan Aitken's libel case</h3>

<p>Failing in health from spreading cancer (which he concealed) he defended the
Guardian against politician Jonathan Aitken who sued for libel about claims of
international misdeeds, including pimping women for the Saudi royal family. It
was tried by a judge, not a jury (who he always preferred).</p>

<p>He first built the high position of Aitken, and then knocked him off, talking
about lack of probity. He established that he had lied (Aitken called it 'sharp
editing') in other situations.</p>

<p>Aitken was his most accomplished adversary, who had a remarkable grasp of the
language and could hold his ground very well (he was once considered as a future
Prime Minister).</p>

<p>He annoyed the judge with his remorseless attention to detail and things
looked bad. Then researchers found that Aitken's wife could not be in Paris when
he had claimed she had paid a crucial bill for the Saudis.</p>

<p>Aitken later went to jail for perjury, for the lies that Carman had teased
out of him.</p>

<h3>Defending against Gillian Taylforth's libel case</h3>

<p>He defended against the libel brought by soap star Gillian Taylforth, who had sued a
newspaper (the Sun) which had claimed she had been giving oral sex in a Range
Rover (she said she was stroking his stomach which was hurting).&nbsp;</p>

<p>He found a video from a party 6 years before, when she 'fooled about' with a
bottle (and a sausage) and said 'I give good head.'</p>

<h3>Other celebrity defences</h3>

<p>&nbsp;He successfully defended a soap star against charges of indecent
assault. The star later privately admitted being guilty.</p>

<p>He saved a comedian (Ken Dodd) and shamed newspaper magnate Robert Maxwell's
sons from financial problems.</p>

<p>He helped Richard Branson win against G-Tech in a lottery scandal.</p>

<h3>Comments from colleagues</h3>

<p>' He was very good at appearing to rise above the fray.'</p>

<p>'He would gather his robes together. He seemed taller than he was.'&nbsp;</p>

<p>'He would just pause. He was a master of the pause.' said a colleague.
'Silence is a deadly weapon', he once said.</p>

<p>He would approach the witness 'softly, softly' and then destroy their
personal credibility of prosecution witnesses. For example, playing on their
past medical record.</p>

<p>As his fame rose, so did his fees. He charged well and for everything,
including going to a client's house for a very social cup of coffee one
evening.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>When he got his teeth into something, he would be a terrier, never letting
go. For others, it was the game, rather than the winning. For George, it was
only about the winning.</p>
<p>'He would go round and round, hitting and hitting.'</p>
