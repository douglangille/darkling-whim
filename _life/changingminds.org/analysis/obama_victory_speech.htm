      for America that most of us cannot begin to imagine, and we are better off 
      for the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader. I congratulate

      she's no longer with us, I know my grandmother is watching, along with the 
      family that made me who I am. I miss them tonight. I know that my debt

      endorsements. Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington - it

      their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep; It drew 
      strength from the 
      not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock 
      on the doors of perfect strangers; from the millions of Americans who 
      volunteered, and organized, and proved that more than two centuries later, 
      a government of the people, by the people and for the people has not 
      perished from the Earth. This is your victory. </td>

      and thin.</p>

      <p>Triple: of/by/for people - evoking Gettysberg address, connecting with 
      the past and the American way.</p>
      <p>'perished from the Earth' - powerful evocation.</p>

      celebrate tonight, we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the 
      greatest of our lifetime - two wars, a planet in peril, the worst 
      financial crisis in a century. Even as we stand here tonight, we know 
      there are brave Americans waking up in the deserts of Iraq and the 
      mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives for us. There are mothers and 
      fathers who will lie awake after their children fall asleep and wonder how 
      they'll make the mortgage, or pay their doctors bills, or save enough for 
      their child's college education. There is new energy to harness and new jobs to be created; new 
      schools to build and threats to meet, alliances to repair. </td>

      remember that if this financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we 
      cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers - in this 
      country, we rise or fall as one nation; as one people. </td>

      who first carried the banner of the Republican Party to the White House - 
      a party founded on the values of self-reliance, individual liberty, and 
      national unity. Those are values we all share, and while the Democratic 
      Party has won a great victory tonight, we do so with a measure of humility 
      and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress. As 
      Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours, We are not enemies, 
      but friends...though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds 
      of affection. And to those Americans whose support I have yet to earn - I

      I will be your President too. </td>

<h3>Further notes</h3>
<p>Sections of the speech may be characterized as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Celebration</li>
  <li>Thanks</li>
  <li>Challenge</li>
  <li>History</li>
  <li>Hope</li>
</ul>
<p>The overall approach is to create an inclusive sense of history where 
individuals make personal sacrifice in order to be a part of a great revival.</p>
<p>The history as told includes the longer American history but with particular 
leverage on African American history, where poverty was and is well known, and 
where struggles in living memory led to significant change.</p>
<p>Inclusion reaches out to all Americans, including Republicans and diverse 
segments. The story is cast as individual action towards a common purpose, 
creating a strong sense of belonging</p>
