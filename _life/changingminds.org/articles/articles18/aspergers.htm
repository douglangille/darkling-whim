Asperger’s put to work: an essay on coding choice and decision making</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I wasn’t diagnosed with Nonverbal Learning Disorder – NLD, similar to Asperger’s 
– until I was 61. For most of my life it’s felt like I live in a quarantined 
room with glass walls, watching people live seemingly normal lives on the other 
side, but unable to touch them. But my world, although far less social, is rich; 
every day I awake filled with curiosity and visions of possibility, with ideas 
to write about and share so others can use; every day my heart aches with the 
need to use my abilities to make a difference and help everyone have the tools 
to be all they can be. </p>
<p>Since I was a kid I’ve had to navigate social situations that render me 
confused and obnoxious: expected social norms are often incomprehensible to me 
(I’ll never understand why strangers ask “How are you?” when it’s such a 
personal question.). My listening skills, apparently, aren’t conventional 
either: I hear, and respond to, the meaning behind words rather than those 
spoken. [Note: Like many Aspies, I hear whole circles/systems when spoken to, 
and often respond to the metamessage intended instead of the words spoken. It 
gets to the heart of any communication quickly. Clients love it, friends 
tolerate it, strangers mock it or call me ‘rude’.]. The world’s just different 
for me. </p>
<p>As a kid my grades suffered until someone figured out I should be given 
essays instead of multiple choice tests (Then I got A’s). I couldn’t make 
friends (no sleepovers, or parties, either in high school or college!) even 
though I was a cheerleader, the school pianist, and editor of the school paper. 
And everyone, including my confounded parents, tried to make me ‘normal’ when I 
did something ‘odd’ or ‘bad’. [In those days there was no diagnosis]. Why 
couldn’t they see/hear/feel me and appreciate my ideas and heart? Why didn’t 
anyone just accept and encourage me? I knew I was smart and kind. It confused me 
that others couldn’t see me because I was different. </p>
<p>I prayed to be normal, to understand what responding ‘appropriately’ meant. I 
longed to join the world, to fit in when I wanted to, but didn’t want to lose my 
authenticity or ideas. I was determined to figure out how Others made choices, 
how I made mine, and note the differences. I remember telling myself that since 
I was in trouble all the time anyway I might as well be in trouble for doing 
what I thought was right, so long as I knew the difference. This formed the 
foundation of my life’s work: figuring out how people could make new, congruent 
choices. In retrospect, I cannot imagine what made me think I could accomplish 
this. But I did. I just did it my way. </p>
<h2>HOW DO WE CHOOSE WHAT WE CHOOSE? </h2>
<p>Starting at age 11 I stole away to a large, flat rock in a nearby reservoir 
to think. From 1957 – 1963 I filled notebooks with ideas, drawings and doodles, 
and fantasized possibilities: how do people choose? What exactly, is choice, and 
how do people know when to choose to do something different? Do one thing over 
another? These questions have filled my entire life. [No Google, no computers, 
no neuroscience or behavioral science or Daniel Kahneman. Just me, a rock, some 
paper and pen, and intense curiosity.] It became my ‘topic’: What caused people 
to think, and act, differently from each other, sometimes with the same set of 
‘givens’? Could people be taught when, if, or how to make different choices? 
Could I change? Could anyone? </p>
<p>I also wrote down conversations – with my parents, and those I overheard - 
noting similarities and differences in words, responses, and intent; I noted 
when Others’ behaviors and dialogues were confusing, and when I got in trouble 
for not making the right choices. I wrote down my own internal dialogue when I 
was apparently out of step, and noted the social situation when I noticed others 
said something different than they meant. </p>
<p>It was obvious that people reacted differently to the same stimulus. Seemed 
everyone’s subjective experience (I call it a system of unique rules, norms, 
beliefs, experience, history etc.) creates the unconscious biases that cause 
their habitual choices.<ol>
	<li>Everyone’s choices come from their unique, historic, subjective internal 
realities (their &#39;system&#39;) and are largely unconscious.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
I collected data in my jobs: From 1975 – 1979 I ran pre-discharge groups and 
family therapy in an in-patient state psychiatric center giving me an invaluable 
opportunity to learn about group communication, hidden agendas and veiled 
meanings, and the vulnerability of maintaining the status quo. 1979-1983 I was a 
stockbroker on Wall Street. From 1983-1989 I founded a tech company in London, 
Hamburg, and Stuttgart and had the opportunity to negotiate and have 
clients/staff from different countries and cultures. I’ve run Buying 
Facilitation® training programs in 5 of the 7 continents. I founded a 
Not-For-Profit around Europe that helped kids with my son’s disease get the 
resources to lead functional lives. Then, and to this day, I have mapped 
communication, choice, and belief-based decision making. </p>
<h2>HOW WE MAINTAIN OUR STATUS QUO </h2>
<p>One of my persistent bewilderments was why people behaved in destructive ways 
even when they had relevant data suggesting they try something else. As I got 
better at mapping the elements behind my own decision making process and 
matching it to what I noticed in Others, I realized the complexity of the 
problem: there’s a broader set of considerations involved than just ‘fixing’ it, 
or weighting choices. Seems there are iterative, sequential steps that must 
occur internally before any system is ready for change (Read Dirty Little 
Secrets for a complete discussion.) including:<ol>
		<li value="2">A. assembling the full, unique data set that comprises the status quo. 
Includes rules, values, goals, relationships/people, history, events, etc.;</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
B. a recognition of anything and everything missing in the status quo that might 
lead to a problem or a lack [omitting anything causes incomplete, possibly 
inaccurate data; attempting to push anything in prematurely causes resistance to 
avoid system destabilization.].<p>
Given the subjectivity and sophistication involved in this process, any change 
we each go through obviously must be initiated, defined, and accepted from 
within our indvidual systems; change being pushed from outside gets resisted 
because it potentially offends the system. Our human systems are sacrosanct.<ol>
			<li value="3">Change must come from within the elements of the system that created the 
problem to ensure the status quo is maintained.</li>
			<li>Any potential change must be agreed upon (i.e. buy-in) by the system of 
rules, experiences, history, people, values (etc.), that hold the initiating 
problem in place.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
Here is the question that has ruled my thinking for decades: How could I, or 
anyone (given we’re each operating from unconscious subjective biases), 
facilitate change in Others if their change factors are unconscious and fight to 
maintain the status quo? </p>
<h2>PUSHING CHANGE VS FACILITATING CHANGE </h2>
<p>In the mid-1980s I discovered NeuroLinguistic Programming (NLP - the study of 
the structure of subjective experience) and studied for three years 
(Practitioner, Master Practitioner, and a unique Beyond/Integration year) 
because I found their unwrapping of human systems cogent and important. While 
it’s not scientifically accepted, NLP is quite important as a way to unpack 
how/why we do what we do and is the most important communication tool of the 
twentieth century. I loved the depth of the discovery process through their 
codified systems of human criteria. Unfortunately, like other influencer models 
(sales, leadership, coaching, healthcare etc.) the NLP practitioner is trained 
to use this knowledge to push change from outside, when it’s far more 
consistent, relevant, accurate and integrous to enable Others to traverse, 
repair, and integrate the route of their own change; NLP practitioners, like 
doctors and sales folks, attempt to cause change (obviously using their own 
personal biases), rather than trusting that people must elicit their own change 
to remain congruent.<ol>
				<li value="5">Until the system determines how to garner buy-in and consensus in a way 
that&#39;s congruent with its own rules, and make room for something new in a way 
the system won’t face disorder, change will be resisted rather than threaten the 
status quo.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
In the late 1980s I discovered the books of Roger Schank who said questions 
could uncover unconscious criteria. Really? Conventional questions were biased, 
restricting responses to the bias of the Asker. Since change is an inside job, 
how could questions enable choice? </p>
<p>I played with this problem for a year and eventually developed a new form of 
question (Facilitative Question) that uses specific words, in a specific order, 
in sequenced steps, as an unbiased directional device (much like a GPS, with no 
bias), giving Outsiders (influencers) the ability to efficiently and congruently 
help Others traverse the route to change, and make quick decisions and shifts in 
ways that their system deems tolerable. In other words, a form of question that 
can be used by doctors, sellers, coaches, leaders – anyone who seeks to enable 
change in others. An example: ‘How will you know if it’s time to reconsider your 
hairstyle?’ instead of ‘Why do you wear your hair like that?’ – leading Others 
directly to the route down their own unconscious change criteria, rather than 
manipulating the change sought by the Questioner. After all, an Outsider can 
never fully understand the makeup of someone else’s unique, unconscious system. 
Why not lead them through to their own change steps?<ol>
					<li value="6">As neutral navigation devices, Facilitative Questions direct the Other’s 
unconscious down the sequence of change without bias, enabling consensus from 
the system, congruent to their own norms. In others words, influencers can help 
people make permanent, congruent change, so long as they eschew leading from 
their own biases.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
Used in sales, coaching, negotiating, leadership, healthcare, decision making, 
and management, these questions help the Other get straight to the heart of 
their own decisions, enabling influencers to quickly determine how – or if – to 
proceed with integrity, collaboration, and authenticity. {In sales, Facilitative 
Questions quickly eliminate those who would never buy, discover and teach those 
with a need (initially recoznized or not) AND an ability to buy, and close sales 
in half the time. Buyers need to take these steps (Pre-Sales) prior to any 
buying decision anyway, and usually make them behind-the-scenes while sellers 
wait.}<p>
In the 80s and 90s, I found the books of Benjamin Libet and Maurice 
Merleau-Ponty who confirmed my early theories that behavior comes from 
subjective experience. I’ve met with, and read close to a thousand books and 
papers from, communication experts, behavioral scientists, neuroscientists. I 
even interviewed for a PhD in Behavioral Sciences, but was told my work was 20 
years ahead of the current research at the time so I couldn’t use my own work as 
my PhD thesis. I did begin an experiment at Columbia with a behavioral scientist 
on the criteria people used to make decisions with (behavioral vs belief), but 
our funding got cut as we were set to begin. And in all of my sales/Buying 
Facilitation® training programs, we have a pilot group compared with a control 
group. </p>
<h2>THE BIRTH OF BUYING FACILITATION®: WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN? </h2>
<p>Putting all of my learning and ideas together, it presents a very different 
picture than the one we currently use to influence, lead, or serve others. 
Here’s a recap.<ol>
						<li>Everyone makes decisions based on their own unique, unconscious subjective 
biases. External data will be resisted, accepted, misunderstood accordingly, 
regardless of the need or efficacy of the information.</li>
						<li>Everyone, and every team, exists within a system of idiosyncratic rules that 
create and maintain the status quo, and will resist change (buying anything, 
shifting behaviors) until the system has bought-in to shifting congruently.</li>
						<li>Conventional questions are biased by the Questioner, and lead to restricted 
data collection and responses. Facilitative Questions lead the system through 
it&#39;s own path to assembly, and change management so it can make its own best 
decisions and discover its own type of Excellence. </li>
						<li>People can only hear/listen according to the parameters of their internal 
biases, and will misunderstand, mishear, forget, filter any data that is not 
aligned. I wrote a book on this: What? Did you really say what I think I heard?</li>
						<li>Change can only happen from the inside, regardless of the external ‘reality’ 
or need.</li>
						<li>Information cannot teach anyone how to make a new decision; all change/choice 
comes from shifts within the existent, systemic beliefs. Information is only 
useful once all elements of change are in place; otherwise it gets misheard, 
misinterpreted, or ignored.</li>
						<li>Until a system knows how, if, when, where to change congruently, no change 
will occur regardless of any external reality.</li>
						<li>It’s possible to facilitate Others through congruent change, be part of their 
decision making process, potentially expand their choices, and work with those 
who are ready, willing, and able. This enables influencers to truly serve rather 
than depend on &#39;intuition&#39; or their own biases.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
I know we spend billions creating pitches, rational arguments, data gathering, 
questionnaires, training, Behavior Modification, etc. But this only captures the 
low hanging fruit – those who have gotten to the place where new ideas, 
solutions, training&#39;s fit. People who<ul>
							<li>think differently,</li>
							<li>have rules, expectations or beliefs that run counter to the offered 
information (but can be recalculated), or</li>
							<li>have not yet reached the realization that they need what you’ve got on offer 
(but do need it)</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
will either mishear, misunderstand, or resist when presented with any outside 
push or data. That means we’re offering our solutions before the system is set 
up for change, finding only the low hanging fruit who have already determined 
their route to change. Conventional models that push/offer/pull information – 
rational or otherwise – cannot do better than be there when the fruit’s ready to 
fall. But by adding some skills that first facilitates change readiness, it’s 
possible to become part of the decision process and a place on the Buying 
Decison Team.<p>
My core thinking remains outside of conventional thinking because it’s not 
academic (although it’s more accepted these days). But after 60 years of study 
and mistakes, 35 years of training clients and running control groups, I’ve 
accomplished my childhood goal. My generic facilitation model (Buying 
Facilitation®) has been taught globally since 1985; it does just what I always 
wanted to do: offer scalable skills to anyone seeking to truly serve others by 
facilitating their own brand of excellence. In other words, I can teach 
influencers to help Others know how, when, if to make new choices for 
themselves. It’s an unconventional model, and certainly not academic. But it’s 
been proven with over 100,000 people globally.<p>
These days, I continue to learn, read, study, and theorize. Should anyone in 
healthcare, sales, leadership, OD, or coaching be interested in learning more, 
or collaborating, or or or, I’m here.</p>
