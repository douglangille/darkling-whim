Resolving Unconscious Bias</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>

Our biases have been developed through the stories of our lives. From birth, our 
parent’s beliefs become part of our unconscious, very personal, ecosystem; the 
cultural norms of our youth create our habits, behaviors, and identity; the 
schools we attend or the gangs we join introduce us to the way our world works 
and how to behave accordingly; our professions are chosen to allow us to spend 
our days within the confines of environments that comfortably maintain our 
norms. Net net, our lives are inspired by our unconscious biases, causing us to 
live and work, marry and spend time with, people whose norms, interpretations, 
and beliefs are very similar to ours.<p>
Our normal skill sets aid and abet us: we listen through biased filters and hear 
and respond to, basically, what our biases tell us was said (I wrote a book on 
this: What? Did you really say what I think I heard? ); we play and read and 
watch according to what we already believe and rarely venture far afield; we 
notice what we notice in response to our nucleus of personal norms, values, and 
learned habits.<p>
Indeed, we trust our unconscious biases and interpretations, and the resulting 
responses, so thoroughly that we are often unaware that our actions – built in, 
normalized and habituated, accepted by our family, peers, and profession – may 
harm others.<h2>
WE CANNOT UNDERSTAND OTHERS</h2>
<p>
We believe, with certainty, that what we see, hear, and feel is ‘real’ because 
it IS our reality; we restrict our lives accordingly, making it difficult, if 
not impossible, to fully understand another’s reality. What we might hear as 
powerful might be heard as insulting by another person; an incident might be 
noticed by one person, ignored by another, and an excuse for violence by 
another. We cannot help but judge others according to our reality.<p>
I, for one, never lock doors. My car is always unlocked. My house is always open 
even when I travel. Many people would find this unthinkable. I find it safe. As 
an incest survivor and a rape victim, I always need a quick way in and out. If a 
door is locked around me, I hyperventilate. Terrifying. These past events, of 
which locks on doors are only a subset of the after-effects of my early life, 
have affected my communication, my lifestyle, my choice of friends and mates, my 
political views, my unconscious triggers, and my choice of professions even 
after decades of therapy. There is no way you can understand my interpretation 
of anything, or the resulting behaviors I exhibit, unless you’ve lived in my 
shoes. And yet my differences might cause you to judge my actions against your 
own and find them wanting.<p>
And herein lie the problem. When we run into others with different lifestyle 
choices, or communication styles, or education, or assumptions, or race, or 
political beliefs, we may not have the skills to connect with them in ways they 
understand; we may wrongly misinterpret their intent. Certainly we may not 
notice we’ve been triggered and behave automatically in ways that inadvertently 
harm another.<p>
I believe that most people don’t intend to harm anyone. But without common 
ground, the best we can do is act from our habituated interpretations and assume 
because we ‘mean well’ that we’re not causing harm.<h2>
NEED FOR CHANGE</h2>
<p>
Historically, we’ve done a bad job caring about resolving the problems of 
inherent bias that may ultimately harm others. I think this might be changing. 
Companies and public servants are now taking unconscious bias seriously and 
requiring unconscious bias training in the hopes of giving people new choices 
and eradicating harm. Good. But I have a concern.<p>
As someone who has spent decades coding and scaling the stages of how human 
systems change, I know it’s not possible to cause change from the outside; each 
individual must find a way to evaluate and reconsider their own core norms and 
biases to make any necessary corrections that only they can make, from within 
(i.e. inside/out). I don’t believe we’re doing that. Current training approaches 
are based on helping folks recognize and change behaviors by offering 
information, practice, scientific data, videos, etc. from the outside 
(outside/in), hoping to create new triggers, new behaviors, and new awareness. 
This approach cannot fix the problem permanently because it:<ul>
	<li>doesn’t get to the root of someone’s unconscious, and very subjective, biases;</li>
	<li>demonstrates subjectively chosen hypothetical situations believed (from the 
outside) to trigger bias and may miss specific issues and habituated norms of an 
individual;</li>
	<li>has no way of knowing if the offered visuals or stories or trial experiences 
address the full range of potential biases within each individual learner;</li>
	<li>doesn’t teach how to transcend someone’s habituated ‘unconscious triggers’ 
that go off in real situations;</li>
	<li>fails to install permanent, instinctive, alternative, appropriate behaviors.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
Current unconscious bias training assumes people can learn enough from videos, 
discussions, ‘practicing ‘real’ situations, etc. what unconscious bias looks 
like to create awareness to recognize a problematic situation before or while 
it’s happening (have you ever tried to do that?) and know exactly what behaviors 
need changing – and what to change them to!<p>
In other words, just when our brains are unconsciously registering ALERT, we 
want it to tell itself ‘Nope. Wrong thinking. Don’t do that. Don’t think that. 
Stop responding that way. Do something different. NOW!’ just as it’s occurring. 
It’s possible to do so, but not with the training offered.<h2>
WHAT IS BIAS? AND WHY IS IT SO HARD TO CHANGE?</h2>
	<p>
Bias is the unconscious, habitual, involuntary, and historic reaction to 
something deemed ‘different’ (skin color, gender, lifestyle choices, etc.) that 
negatively triggers someone’s largely unconscious beliefs and values – going 
against what the person deems ‘right’ or ‘good’ as per the subjective filters 
through which they experience their lives - causing an automatic feeling of, and 
defense against, some sort of violation.<p>
Our reactions to external stimuli are unconscious and automatic, and follow our 
brain’s historic and habituated neural pathways whenever our unconscious 
triggers go off. To alter these, it’s necessary to go to the source; it’s not 
possible to permanently change behaviors by merely changing behaviors. Offering 
training that merely offers examples and experiences of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ 
behaviors, and expecting people to undo their habituated triggers because they 
‘admit’ to, or recognize ‘bad’ behaviors, uses the wrong thinking. Changing core 
biases permanently is not a behavior change issue; it’s a core Identity/Belief 
problem that must be resolved at the source, within the system that created it. 
I’ll lay the problem out for you piece by piece, then introduce a solution for 
permanent change. Basically, this level of change is a systems problem.<h2>
WHAT IS A SYSTEM, AND WHY IS IT NECESSARY TO ADDRESS IN BIAS TRAINING</h2>
	<p>
A system is a conglomeration of (historic, unique) elements (consisting of our 
norms, culture, history, values, beliefs, dreams, etc.) that we hold largely 
unconsciously. They are formed during our lifetimes starting from birth, and as 
in all systems, are made up of elements (beliefs, values, cultural norms, 
ethics, morality, etc.) that operate from the same set of rules. Indeed, we live 
our lives in cities alongside others of similar political beliefs, marry people 
of similar education, and even listen with biased filters that keep out 
uncomfortable ideas.<p>
Systems are congruent (Systems Congruence, Homeostasis) entities that always 
seek stability; they define our politics, our mate selection, even where we live 
and how we listen to others. Because systems seek to maintain congruence, they 
have a finely tuned unconscious organizational structure of filters that seek 
out, and avoid, situations that make them uncomfortable or they find 
incongruent. Attempting to shift them causes resistance as this level change 
causes the system to be incongruent, regardless of the seeming need to do 
something different or the efficacy of a new/better solution. In other words, 
our status quo shows up every day to maintain itself and we will do whatever it 
takes to maintain it. It’s who we are.<p>
For permanent change to occur, for new behaviors to be exhibited and chosen, 
there must be a change in core beliefs before new skills or situations are 
offered because anything ‘new’ would have no place to fit in our largely 
automated ‘system’. Current bias training uses methods don’t facilitate this 
change:<ul>
		<li><b>Listening</b>: our habituated listening filters and neural pathways automatically 
bias whatever anyone says to us; we set up our lives to avoid discomfort, and 
uniquely interpret differences in what has been said so our brains can keep us 
comfortable. When information is offered as evidence, our historic, habituated, 
biased listening filters kick in and uniquely interpret incoming data, often 
differently than the intended meaning. Indeed, it’s not even possible to hear 
anyone without bias; when what we hear (or see, or feel) makes us uncomfortable, 
we react historically regardless of how far the intended meaning is from our 
interpretation. </li>
		<li><b>Questions</b>: all normal questions are biased by the Asker’s subjective 
curiosity, thereby restricting the Responder’s replies to the Responder’s 
reaction and interpretation of what was heard, and potentially overlooking real 
answers. </li>
		<li><b>Historic</b>: biases are programmed in from the time we’re born. Every day we wake 
up with the same biases, kept in place by our choice of friends, TV, neighborhoods, professions, reading materials, etc. To permanently shift our 
biases, we’d have to change our historic programming. </li>
		<li><b>Physiological</b>: who we ‘are’ is systemic; our beliefs and norms, character and 
values have been programmed in and become our Identity, creating the behaviors 
and responses that will unconsciously maintain our status quo in everything we 
do and every action we take. </li>
		<li><b>Triggers</b>: because of our lifetime of inculcated beliefs, values, norms and 
outlook, our brains react chemically, unconsciously, and automatically when 
there is an untoward activity. </li>
		<li><b>Information</b>: our training programs typically tell, show, explain, offer 
stories, videos, etc. etc. using our biased choices, in our favored formats, in 
our languaging, in hopes that our information triggers recognition, or new 
behavior adoption to people who may not process what we&#39;re telling them in the 
way we would prefer. They may not interpret, or know how to recognize a need 
for, or understand, how to make sense of whatever we’re telling them. </li>
		<li><b>Behaviors</b>: as the expression and execution of our beliefs and status quo, 
behaviors translate our core systemic beliefs and norms into daily action. 
Behaviors represent us; they are not ‘us’. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>
And herein lie the problem. Because of the complexity and sophisticated 
combination of the elements above, merely doing something different because we 
are told to, or even want to, won’t change our behaviors or our systems 
permanently. It’s the equivalent of trying to get a forward moving robot to move 
backwards because we tell it it needs new options, or think it would be better 
if it did, or show it pictures of other robots who do move backward. To change 
behaviors permanently it’s necessary to change the system, the programming, 
which created them to begin with. And this cannot be accomplished by trying to 
change the output of the problem itself. Remember Einstein? Trying to change 
behaviors with the system that created them won’t permanently change behaviors.<h2>
CHANGE IS A SYSTEMS PROBLEM</h2>
		<p>
Change is the alteration of something that has existed in a certain way, using 
specific and accepted norms, in a specific configuration, for a period of time. 
To amend our responses to bias, we must first recognize, then modify, the 
specific triggers (historically produced for a reason) that have been developed 
to operate unconsciously as the norm.<p>
It’s basically a systems problem: for permanent change to occur, we must 
reconfigure the system that has created and maintains the status quo, and has 
operated ‘as is’ for some amount of time. Anything new coming in to our system 
(any problem to fix, any new information that creates disruption, any new 
activity the system is asked to take) demands changing the status quo. Indeed, 
any new decision is a change management problem. The way we are addressing the 
problem of changing people’s unconscious biases is not enabling permanent 
change.<p>
Change means that a system (by definition stable) must go through a process to 
become something different:<ul>
			<li>a trigger alerts the status quo that something may be awry;</li>
			<li>a careful examination by all elements within the status quo must occur to find 
any incongruence;</li>
			<li>agreement within the system (rules, stakeholders, identity, etc.) that change 
is necessary and that a fix won’t cause permanent disruption;</li>
			<li>an initial attempt to fix anything missing on its own (using the same elements 
that created the problem to begin with);</li>
			<li>the realization that the problem cannot be fixed from within the system;</li>
			<li>an examination by everything that created the problem of any new possibilities 
that will create Systems Congruence;</li>
			<li>an understanding and acceptance of the downside and disruption of a change 
(i.e. if politics change, how do we speak with family? If same-sex 
relationships, what happens with our church group?);</li>
			<li>a fix is found that is agreeable, with full knowledge of how to circumvent any 
disruption it will cause;</li>
			<li>new habits, new triggers, new neural pathways, etc. are developed in a way 
that incorporate the ‘new’ with the old to minimize disruption.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
Does any element of the original need to be kept in place? How will the system 
know? How would any change effect the whole? How will the bits that need change 
shift while still maintaining its core values? The system will fight to maintain 
itself. If all of the above aren’t managed, the system will fill in the blanks 
with something comfortable and habituated (regardless of its efficacy). In other 
words, if there is not systemic agreement, no known way to resolve the problem 
using its current givens, no known way to incorporate something new to the 
existing system so the system doesn’t implode, no change will happen regardless 
of the need or the efficacy of the solution.<p>
Indeed, you can’t change a behavior by trying to change a behavior. And all of 
the current bias training involves a focus on getting behaviors changed without 
addressing the source that created the behaviors and triggers to begin with.<h2>
WHAT IS A BEHAVIOR?</h2>
			<p>
Current Bias Training attempts to get behaviors changed by using ‘rational’ 
means: showing learners biased situations, offering data and research, and 
playing videos to learn what bias looks like. In other words, offering 
Information: showing and telling people what’s wrong with what they’re doing and 
what ‘right’ would look like – all of which can be misinterpreted, misread, or 
objected to, regardless of our intent. While it certainly can make people more 
aware, these attempts will not cause permanent change: they develop no new 
habituated triggers or neural pathways to set off a new response to a stimulus. 
Let’s delve into this a bit.<p>
Behaviors are what we do - transactions automatically initiated by our core 
system of beliefs, norms, and experience, to act out and express, who we are. We 
all develop behaviors that ‘be’ who we are, to represent us. Behaviors are the 
output, the forward movement of the robot, the actions others see.<p>
If asked in a vacuum if we want to harm anyone, few of us would want to. And yet 
in small and large ways, our unconscious behaviors too often end up unjustly 
ignoring, being mean to, or harming someone because of their gender, or race or 
or... I once heard Malcolm Gladwell, who is bi-racial, say that when tested for 
unconscious racial bias, he came up biased. We all carry some biases. The 
question becomes 1. Do we notice when, or before, problems occur, and if not 
what would we need to know or believe differently to notice, and 2. Once we 
notice (or not) can we have choice over our actions and avoid biased behaviors 
or make adjustments at the time, or just before, they occur.<p>
To permanently change a behavior, a system must:<ul>
				<li>shift the core beliefs that inform any habituated, unconscious bias and 
develop additional beliefs, assumptions and triggers;</li>
				<li>create new neural pathways to the brain that lead to choosing more respectful 
outputs, habits, behaviors;</li>
				<li>listen with a different listening filter than the habituated ones;</li>
				<li>enable the person to change themselves, using their own unconscious system of 
norms to design new behaviors that won’t offend the system;</li>
				<li>interpret another’s actions in a neutral way that doesn’t offend our own 
beliefs – or change our beliefs.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
To change our unconscious, automatic responses that cause us to respond 
defensively, the system that has created and maintains the status quo must be 
reconfigured to produce alternate outputs while still maintaining Systems 
Congruence. And unfortunately, information-based training (showing, feeling, 
telling, explaining) is ineffective.<p>
Offering any sort of information before the system knows why, how, when, or if 
to do anything different – a belief change - will only inspire resistance as the 
system won’t know how to apply it as it’s ‘just fine, thanks.’ It’s a belief 
change issue. We’re asking the system to repopulate its status quo that created 
the problem to begin with, design new behavioral responses, and develop a new 
set of triggers to tell the system it’s time to behave differently. Initially 
the system doesn’t know what it doesn’t know and has no inherent desire to do 
anything different.<p>
In pursuit of excellence, people need some sort of stimulus to begin a process. 
It’s only during this process the holes in their knowledge become clear: what’s 
the distance between its current norms and something new and why isn’t the 
status quo good enough; between what’s been working and what’s now accepted as 
not working; the old behaviors and responses and designing new ones.<p>
It’s only in the distance between here and there, one set of givens vs another, 
a known against an unknown, is there’s a desire to change something. And here is 
where it needs information. If it’s believed that all is well, regardless of any 
evidence otherwise, the system will not seek out, or pay attention to, any 
information, regardless of its efficacy.<p>
As per my robot example, if you think the robot should have the option of moving 
backwards, telling it when and how to know when or if to move backward, giving 
it scientific data as to why it should move backward, or pushing it backward, 
will not cause the robot to change. The programming must be changed. And so it 
is with all of us: when we change our habituated beliefs and norms (our 
programming), our behavior will automatically change.<h2>
CHANGING BEHAVIORS DOESN’T CHANGE BEHAVIORS</h2>
				<p>
Real change demands a systemic shift to create new triggers, new assumptions, 
new neural pathways, and ultimately, as an outcome, new behaviors. No one, no 
information, no person, from outside is able to go into someone’s unconscious to 
(re)create all these things. And permanent change will not happen until it does. 
The goal is not to train someone to rid themselves of unconscious bias; it’s to 
teach the system itself how to discover where it is designating the bias and 
facilitate it through to new behaviors a way that maintains the foundational 
norms of the system. It’s using the old to trigger the new. Both/And, not 
Either/Or. I know this is a lot to understand. Call me and I’ll discuss. 512 771 
1117.<p>
Basically, to alter the foundation that will develop new behaviors, the brain 
must change itself. Over the past decades, I’ve coded the 13 steps that 
constitute the route to systemic, human change so people can make their OWN 
internal changes that will lead to new choices, i.e. new behaviors. I’ve taught 
this model in sales as Buying Facilitation® to global corporations (KPMG, Morgan 
Stanley, IBM, P&amp;G, Kaiser, etc.) for over 30 years, and written several books on 
it. The book that details each of the stages is Dirty Little Secrets: why buyers 
can’t buy and sellers can’t sell.<p>
We must become Facilitators, not Influencers. We must teach folks to create and 
habituate new neural pathways and filters. 
				<ol>
					<li><b>Listening</b>: We must avoid habituated neural pathways when listening to others. 
In your mind’s eye put yourself on the ceiling and listen from above. From 
above, you can observe what’s going on without bias or reaction. I have a whole 
chapter on this in What?. Not difficult – you just need to want to do it and 
develop triggers that will alert you to the need to do something different. </li>
					<li><b>Questions</b>: I developed a new form of question that doesn’t interrogate and is 
not biased by the needs of the questioner, but instead acts like a GPS to guide 
people through their own unconscious. These Facilitative Questions are systemic, 
use specific words, in specific order, that traverse through the steps of change 
sequentially so others can note their own incongruencies. So: What would you 
need to know or believe differently to be willing to take an extra step and 
consciously choose to listen from a ‘different ear’? </li>
					<li><b>Beliefs</b>: by shifting the focus from changing behaviors to first changing 
beliefs and systems, we end up with permanent core change, new triggers and 
habits. </li>
					<li><b>Information</b>: we make several types of information available for the learner 
to choose from, to fit their own learning criteria and styles, and needs to fit 
into their unique areas of deficiency. </li>
					</ol>
					<p>
I’ve developed a new way to train that facilitates self-learning and permanent 
change from within the system. For those wishing a full discussion, I’ve written 
an article on this that appeared in The 2003 Annual, Volume 1 Training (I’m 
happy to send you a more specific discussion of this if you’re not already 
bored) Just note: my process leads people, without any bias, to those places in 
their brains, into their system of beliefs and cultural norms, which made the 
decisions to employ their biased behaviors to begin with, and teaches them how 
to reconfigure their system to adopt something new (so long as its aligned with 
their beliefs). We are making the unconscious conscious and developing more 
appropriate triggers and behaviors.<p>
How will you know that by adding systemic change elements to your training that 
you can enable more people to make more appropriate behavioral choices around 
their bias?<p>
If you would like my help in designing a program that resolves unconscious 
biases permanently, I’d love to help. I believe it’s an important task. I 
believe it’s time we had the tools to enable learners to permanently change and 
become non-judgmental, accepting, and kind. And above all, cause no harm. All of 
our lives depend on it.<p>
