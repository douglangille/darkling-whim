Why Building Relationships is an Unsuccessful Sales Technique</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In 1937 Dale Carnegie published his celebrated How to Win Friends and Influence 
People - the first book suggesting sellers build relationships as a route to 
closing sales. 1937: with primitive transportation, sellers found clients closer 
to home; telephones were emerging (FYI – Morse Code was preferred for 40 years 
after the telephone was invented!); marketing avenues were limited, as was 
advertising (Sears Catalogue, Life Magazine, The Farmer’s Almanac, the local 
paper or general store). Obviously there was no technology, or global 
competition, and it was difficult to sell to prospects outside of local markets.<p>
Selling focused on natural customers - face-to-face relationships with neighbors 
and friends, without whom sales would suffer. And buyers, needing sellers for 
information and relevance, automatically trusted them. Relationships were vital.<p>
It’s now 2018. We have a plethora of options to present our solutions. Our 
communications capability is global, cheap, and ubiquitous. With safe payment 
and delivery options, global competitors are pervasive. And – here’s the big one 
- our prospects have the ability to receive the information they need to easily 
choose a solution without us. Buyers contact us only when they’ve done their 
Pre-Sales change work and are ready. They don’t need a relationship with us.<p>
Connections with strangers proliferate online; we have a far broader reach than 
ever. But because we don’t know these strangers intimately, we don’t consider 
them real relationships and don’t automatically trust them – especially when 
they abuse the connection by attempting to push product. Indeed, the 
‘relationship’ angle is now specious, and the Carnegie missive is defunct. 
Buyers don’t need the relationship to find what they need online. But as you’ll 
see below, they sure could use a hand becoming buyers.<h2>
THE PLOY OF BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS</h2>
<p>
When sellers now attempt to use ‘relationship’ as a ploy to sell, they encourage 
distrust; the Carnegie dictum is invalid. Here’s the reality:<ul>
	<li>Everyone knows you&#39;re pretending. Until you’ve known people over time, through 
the good times and bad, you’re not in a relationship with anyone, especially 
when you’re trying to be nice so you can meet your own agenda.</li>
	<li>A &#39;relationship&#39; will not facilitate a sale. Buyers cannot buy unless they 
have managed their internal change management journey that</li>
	</ul>
	<blockquote>
		<ol>
			<li>assembles all the people needed to be involved and hears their 
voices/concerns/criteria;</li>
			<li>gets buy-in from the Buying Decision Team that something must change;</li>
			<li>figures out how to meet everyone’s needs and make adjustments that fit 
without internal disruption.</li>
			</ol>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
Buyers can’t buy until they’re ready, willing, and able to bring something new 
into their status quo regardless of how ‘nice’ you are. In other words, until or 
unless change is planned for in a systemic way that touches all the right people 
and policies and garners buy-in and assures non-disruptive change, buyers cannot 
buy or they risk disrupting whatever IS working regardless of the problem they 
should resolve, or the efficacy of the solution. Buying doesn’t cause selling.<p>
Change is based on systemic success factors; they cannot buy until they 
understand the full complement of risk factors involved, regardless of their 
problem or the efficacy of the solution. [Sometimes, fixing an existent problem 
is more costly than bringing in a new solution. In all cases, the status quo has 
been normalized and resistant to change, even though it has caused, and 
maintains, the problem needing fixing. Buying is a change management problem.] 
It is possible, however, to develop a real relationship quickly by facilitating 
a buying decision down the steps of change.<p>
Buyers aren’t swayed by niceness. Buyers aren’t swayed by niceness. It will, 
however, make you a preferred vendor WHEN ALL ELSE IS EQUAL and WHEN THEY HAVE 
REACHED THE POINT OF CHOICE when they’re ready, willing, and able to consider 
buying something (i.e. Step 10 of the 13 step buying decision journey).<p>
It doesn’t work when your focus is a sale. Here is a real dialogue: 
			<p class="quote">
SELLER: HI SHARON! AND how are YOU today??<p class="quote">
SDM:[picking up the phone in tears] My name’s not Sharon! And I’m rotten. I just 
put my dog down!<p class="quote">
SELLER: Hangs up the phone. <p>
I offered an ‘authentic’ relationship moment, useful as an opportunity to 
connect: he should have said ‘I’m sorry that happened. Obviously you can&#39;t speak 
now. Is there a better time? This is a sales call and I&#39;d like to discuss X when 
you&#39;re feeling better. Again, I’m so sorry about your dog.’<p>
Whether for a large, complex sale, or a small personal item, buyers cannot buy 
until they have their internal ducks in a row, and know their route and risks 
through the change they’ll face when altering their status quo with a new 
solution, regardless of its efficacy. (Step 10 of a 13 Step process). Because 
the sales model focuses on placing solutions – possible only after buyers have 
completed their systemic, and very idiosyncratic, Pre-Sales change management 
issues – we don’t have the focus to discern where buyers are along their Buying 
Decision Path and end up waiting for buyers show up seeking a transactional 
connection. Our ‘niceness’ (which I’m differentiating from real customer 
service) is irrelevant; we just sound like everyone else trying to sell them 
something. We enter each discussion asking and listening for only what we want 
to hear, causing distrust.<h2>
DIFFERENTIATION?</h2>
			<p>
Following acceptable marketing criteria of the era – words and phrases that are 
in vogue, graphics and colors that are deemed ‘what everyone is doing’ – it’s 
hard to be unique. And the myth of being a ‘Relationship Manager’ or ‘creating a 
relationship’ is supposed to show buyers why they should choose us over the 
competition. See?? I’m NICE!<p>
Here’s the truth: buyers don’t start off wanting to buy anything whether or not 
the responses from your (biased) questions makes it sound like they have a need. 
They merely want solve a problem in the most effective way possible, with an 
assurance that they won’t face internal disruption if a change is needed. It’s 
only once they’ve determined their systemic change management requirements (that 
an Outsider can never know or understand) that they’ll buy - but by then they’ll 
have chosen their list of vendors and solutions from online data or referrals.<p>
By focusing on attempting to influence people to buy because you&#39;re nice, you&#39;re 
left out of their behind-the-scenes decision process where you CAN enter and 
make a difference that creates a real relationship, reduced to running around 
trying to ‘be there’ when/if they finally show up as buyers (the low hanging 
fruit, or 5%). Not to mention chasing bad leads with folks who you think should 
be buyers (Prospects are those who WILL buy, not those who SHOULD buy.) vs 
offering true leadership to help them through their change management journey.<p>
You can mitigate this and REALLY be nice by entering enter early (and before 
trying to sell) and facilitating buyers through the confustion route of their 
systemic change. I’ve coded the steps in their decision sequence and developed a 
model that facilitates Pre-Sales Buyer Readiness (Buying Facilitation®). You 
don’t have to use my model – create your own! But entering the buyer/seller 
interaction as a change facilitator will differentiate you and enable a true 
relationship.<p>
Buyers would never buy from anyone else when a seller has taught the prospect 
how to assemble ALL of the folks necessary to be part of the Decision Team, or 
HOW to get everyone on board for change. Remember: they will do this anyway 
before they buy – they might as well do this with you.<h2>
CASE STUDY: HELP BUYERS BUY AND DEVELOP TRUST</h2>
			<p>
Here’s an example. Years ago, working with KPMG, I spoke with my regular client 
(Dave, a Senior Partner/Consultant) who said he designing a large presentation 
with this team of Senior Partners for a first call with Boing for a $50,000,000 
global tax solution they thought Boing needed. They were merely working off of 
what they assumed the prospect ‘need’ was and carefully presenting what KPMG 
could offer, assuming their facts and professionalism would build a 
relationship. They had a history of a 3 year sales cycle with their solution, 
and the first presentation to the Tax Director was crucial for any forward 
movement of their relationship (usually the second conversation with the CFO 
occurred 6 months after the first).<p>
I suggested to Dave that before meeting, they should call the Tax Director with 
one of my Facilitative Questions to help Boing begin the Pre Sales process of 
discovering where their systemic issues lie, and if they could resolve them 
internally--- the understanding being that when/if they couldn’t, they’d need to 
buy KPMG’s solution. Here’s the conversation they had.<p>
KPMG, using a Facilitative Question to help Boing begin understanding of where 
the ‘holes’ were in their system: How are you currently ensuring that your full 
global management team are communicating in a timely fashion so they all have 
the same data at the same time to facilitate quick decisions and team buy-in 
across countries and time zones?<p>
Boing Tax Director: What? I have no idea how to answer that, but I suspect we’re 
not managing this very well. Hang on a minute. [He left the call for several 
minutes and returned with the CFO on the other end of the phone thus eliminating 
the first 6 months of the sales cycle.] Jim, this is Dave from KPMG. He’s asked 
a very important question that I don’t think we have an answer to but we should 
have. Dave, can you say that again?<p>
Dave repeated the question, to which Jim replied: Wow. Yes. We need the answer 
to that. Do you have any more questions we need answers to?<p>
Dave then went through the list of Facilitative Questions I had developed for 
him that began the process of leading Boing through the internal issues they’d 
need to determine to figure out if they could resolve their global tax situation 
themselves (in which case they didn’t need KPMG, but they’d consider this before 
considering spending $50,000,000 with an outside group). By the time KPMG got to 
the presentation a month later, it wasn’t needed: the entire Buying Decision 
Team was present (cutting off another 6 months of the sales cycle) and ready 
with questions for them. The sale was closed in 4 months rather than 3 years.<p>
The time it takes buyers to discover their own best answers is the length of the 
sales cycle, regardless of your relationship. In this case, my Facilitative 
Questions ultimately led them to global buy-in and change management in a 
fraction of the time – questions used to facilitate their understanding and 
ability of the effects of the change a new solution would involve, and assemble 
the right people and considerations, not gather information from a biased 
mind-set, or be ‘nice’ to build a relationship. The very focus on helping 
prospects enable their own change develops trust and relationship.<p>
As sellers we forget that buyers have to go through this anyway, with us or 
without us. We sit and wait for long periods of time while they go through this 
process, and then compete for the 5% who finally show up. Why not add a skill 
set and help them make this process efficient AND build relationships!<p>
There’s a way to make money AND make nice. It’s by being a true Servant Leader 
and change facilitator; by entering into a WE Space in which there is a tracit 
agreement that everyone will be served. Stop using ‘nice’ as a sales ploy. Stop 
focusing on the low hanging fruit. Add a change management focus and find real 
buyers who&#39;ve already recognized a problem, and first facilitate them through 
their route to inclusive, congruent, systemic change. Then you can become part 
of the Buying Decision Team, make a difference, close more, waste less time, and 
act with integrity.<p>
