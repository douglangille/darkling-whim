Servant Leadership: new skills to serve others, and why the old ones don't 
work</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I became enamored of the concept Servant Leadership in the 1980s. Developed by 
Robert Greenleaf, it’s defined thus: 
<p class="quote">
<i>A philosophy and set of practices that 
enriches the lives of individuals, builds better organizations and ultimately 
creates a more just and caring world. </i>
<p>
Greenleaf says, &quot;The servant-leader is servant first… It begins with the natural 
feeling that one wants to serve.&quot;<p>
Such an important concept, yet the skills to practice it elude us. I’d like to 
help change that.<h2>
THE BIAS PROBLEM </h2>
<p>
As a Buddhist, I deeply believe that serving one another is a necessary aspect 
of our lives. But the communication skill sets inherent in our culture don’t 
make it easy for influencers to truly serve:<ul>
	<li>Conventional questions are little more than interrogations based on the 
needs/biases of the Asker. They pull information to enable the Asker to create 
an approach that will generate specific results, thereby restricting the full 
set of possible responses to fit more closely with the needs of the 
interrogator. The real answers might lie outside the scope of the questions, 
potentially causing flawed data gathering, missed opportunities, resistance, 
loss of success, and damaged relationships. Certainly an enhanced opportunity 
for failure.</li>
	<li>Normal listening practices listen for content, ensuring we hear mainly what 
our brains want us to hear as per our subjective listening filters, biases, 
assumptions, triggers, and habituated neural pathways. Obviously, our range of 
understanding is restricted accordingly. (See What? Did you really say what I 
think I heard?) In other words, we hear some portion of the full data set – and 
it’s biased, at that. This problem is exacerbated when our brain doesn’t tell us 
what it discarded or misrepresented during the ‘listening’, leaving us to act on 
what we believe we’ve fully understood – but is most likely some degree of 
wrong, a problem for both Asker and Responder.</li>
	<li>Information – regardless of its accuracy, importance, or presentation – cannot 
be accepted or accurately interpreted when it flies in the face of the Other’s 
Beliefs. Information when used as a convincer strategy will succeed only when 
the listener already agrees with it. Our brilliant stories, pitches, rational 
data, and advice will not convince Others that change is necessary until the 
Other has already discerned how to make the appropriate changes internally, to 
ready themselves for the disruption a new idea might bring to the status quo. 
It’s just not possible for an outsider to elicit permanent change by pushing 
information of any kind, regardless of its efficacy.</li>
	<li>We tend to focus on Behavior Change, forgetting that Behaviors are merely the 
transaction of our Beliefs – Beliefs in action if you will. Change occurs at the 
unconscious Belief level which when happens, will cause new Behaviors to emerge 
automatically. Think of it this way: a robot that only moves forward will not 
move backward if you tell it to, or explain why it should change, or provide a 
scientific reason why walking backward is best, etc. The only way the robot will 
walk backward is by changing the programming. And so it is with our approach: 
once we enable Others to change their own unconscious Beliefs, their Behavior 
will automatically change. And we will have served them.</li>
	<li>As influencers (coaches, parents, sellers, leaders, etc.), we believe it’s our 
responsibility to cause Others to change in the way we believe they must. We 
find best methods to push our agendas using convincing, manipulating, 
explaining, advising, etc. strategies meant to lead, influence, manipulate, 
modify, correct, what we think Others should do, causing resistance in all but a 
few. But we’re never taught to trust they can – they must - design and discover 
their own best answers and route to change. We fail to fully understand that no 
one, no Outsider, can ever understand another’s unconscious system. </li>
	</ul>
<p>With our current skill sets, we end up pushing our own agendas (in the name 
of the Other, of course), according to our subjective needs, beliefs, and goals 
(using our ‘professionalism’ and ‘intuition’ to tell ourselves we’re ‘right’) 
and restrict the full set of possibilities – even potentially causing a rift in 
the relationship. We assume that because we have the moral high ground, that 
because our intention is honorable (or necessary, or dictated by above, or 
rational, etc.) the only missing piece is ‘how best’ to get Others to do what we 
think they should do. I once ran a Buying Facilitation® training for The Covey 
Leadership Center. They staunchly believed that because they were teaching The 
Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, they were above manipulation and 
‘healers’ who had the right to push and manipulate. And they absolutely believed 
that because they were ‘right’ they got to use any strategies they need to 
convince.<p>
We forget that by assuming we have Another’s answers, and taking on the job of 
making sure the Other does what’s ‘right’, we end up taking their power away, 
assuredly biasing the direction of their growth journey, and not serving them at 
all. Not to mention it’s quite impossible to understand Another’s unconscious, 
that whatever they are doing has been part of their normal operating system and 
used habitually during the course of their lives. <p>
Regardless of the efficacy of what we offer, our approach threatens the Other’s 
status quo. Our biased questions, the Other’s inability to hear us outside of 
their habituated listening filters (and our inability to hear them accurately), 
and the existing rules and Beliefs that have put the current (problematic) 
behaviors in place, will resist us. We are causing the resistance we receive and 
blaming them for their resistance - prospects who seem ‘stupid’, and patients 
who ‘don’t care’ about their health, students who ‘don’t want’ to learn, and 
clients who ‘won’t listen’ to us. <h2>
WHY WE CAN’T CHANGE OTHERS EVEN WITH GOOD MOTIVES</h2>
	<p>
We know someone needs to stop smoking, or eat differently. We are certain the 
environment is in trouble. But we don’t seem to have the ability to get someone 
to change. We provide all the scientific evidence, relate a story of someone who 
has died, or offer different approaches to stop. And yet they persist. We know 
that a company or group really, really needs our solution, and yet they persist 
with failing results rather than buy. <p>
What is going on? Why would anyone prefer to maintain failure rather than 
change? Seems that way, but it’s not entirely accurate. Everyone would prefer 
Excellence, but using conventional practices, change runs the risk of permanent 
disruption in our comfortable habits and status quo; outside-in push/behavior 
change approaches do not effectively manage the unconscious that would need to 
buy-in, and accomodate for, any change. Let’s start with our attempts to have 
Another change a behavior. The reasons we fail mount up:<ol>
		<li><b>Threatening the system</b>: Our status quo - our unique &#39;system&#39; of rules, 
Beliefs, values, experiences, culture, etc. - has become habituated and 
normalized over time. This system that has developed the Behaviours we think 
need to be changed enable us to show up as who we are. We wake up daily, and 
maintain whoever we were yesterday without judgement. Our system just IS, good 
or bad, right or wrong. And it will fight to the death to maintain itself. 
Literally. </li>
		<li><b>Change Behaviors</b>: Behaviors are merely the translations of, the action of, 
the underlying system of Beliefs that initiated them to begin with. They allow 
us to wake up every day and show the world who we are. When we try to change the 
Behavior, we push against the entire system they represent. Regardless of the 
efficacy of our solution or their dire need, unless the change comes from the 
within the system and the system is reorganized around the ‘new’, it will be 
resisted.</li>
		<li><b>Information doesn’t get heard</b>: Our brains/ears hear subjectively, filtering 
out and misconstruing what’s not comfortable all on its own, failing to tell us 
that what we think we hear is most likely some fraction off of what the Speaker 
intended.</li>
		<li><b>Ignore the steps to change</b>: As outsiders, we too often use our own intuition 
and professed knowledge to push the change we want. But for any change to occur, 
for Beliefs to shift in a way that causes Behaviors to change, the Other must 
take specific, albeit unconscious steps: the system would need to find a way to 
include the change into normal operating procedures, end up with minimal 
disruption, and achieve buy-in for any new behavior change.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
So our entire approach leads to a high degree of bias, resistance, and failure 
as we promote the changes we think should occur in a way that challenges 
Another&#39;s status quo. We don’t realize that whatever ‘new’ comes into an 
existing system must fit with the status quo or it gets rejected rather than be 
disrupted. We don’t realize we’re actually causing the resistance we receive.<p>
And resist they do - not because our data or goals aren’t worthy or necessary, 
and not because they don’t want to change per se, but because our good will, 
shared information, and ‘push’ tactics conflict with the Other’s unconscious 
system that protects itself from unknowable disruption. Indeed, any 
modifications to the status quo would have to be performed in a way would leave 
the system congruent. The system would rather be fine, as it is, than not exist. 
And the time it takes for the system to accept and make room for the ‘new’ is 
the length of time it takes for adoption. With the best will in the world we 
challenge their Systems Congruence.<p>
And unfortunately, as doctors and sellers, trainers and consultants, parents and 
coaches – as influencers - we don’t have the full set of skills to do more than 
attempt to cause change, rather than elicit it. We don’t naturally possess the 
skills of Servant Leadership. </p>
<h2>GIVE UP INDIVIDUAL NEEDS</h2>
		<p>
True Servant Leadership enables others to elicit their own congruent change. 
Since our current skill sets won’t get us there, we need new skills that 
facilitate Others, and a switch in perspective to enabling Others to discover 
their own answers. We must change the trajectory of our efforts. There is a 
route to facilitating Another’s change that is congruent, highly successful, and 
offers real leadership with no resistance. <p>
I’ve spent my life coding the unconscious route through to choice and change. 
Although I’ve often written about, and trained it, in the sales industry (Buying 
Facilitation®), it’s actually a generic Change Facilitation model that offers 
the tools to enable Others to discover and own their own Excellence, an 
Excellence that complies with the rules and history of their own Beliefs, an 
Excellence that can be eagerly, joyously adopted because it operates from within 
their status quo. <p>
Servant Leadership assumes:<ol>
			<li>Others have their own answers and routes to their own destination, and are 
the only ones who can enter their unconscious system to effect change. An 
outsider (regardless of intent, need, or efficacy of message) can never, ever, 
fully understand the inner workings of Another’s unconscious system that has 
defined them. It&#39;s possible to facilitate Others to their own state of 
Excellence, using their own route to congruent change. Our responsibility is to 
lead them through the pathway to change themselves. </li>
			<li>We only have questions for Another, not answers. And since conventional 
questions are biased interrogations (biased by the wording, the intent, the 
direction, and the goal of the Asker) that may miss important, hidden, elements 
necessary for the Other to elicit their change criteria, I’ve designed a new 
form of question (Facilitative Questions) that, with specific wording in 
specific order, acts as a directional device to lead Others through their own 
systemic, unique trajectory of change. These questions teach Others to pursue 
their own unconscious to sequentially discover their own answers, in a way that 
causes new understanding and decision making. </li>
			<li>There is no way for an outsider to have THE ANSWERS. Often influencers are 
self-serving, using their ‘intuition’ (a subjectively biased guess), 
professional knowledge, or best wishes, to push another to where they want them 
to be, having no knowledge of the systemic elements that created and maintain 
the problem and that must buy-in to any change.</li>
			<li>To listen without bias or misunderstanding, we must practice Dissociative 
Listening to avoid the filters, bias, assumptions, and triggers that are part of 
our normal listening. [Note: for those interested in learning Dissociative 
Listening, read Chapter 6 in What?.]</li>
			<li>We get credit for serving. That’s it.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
Decades ago, I mapped the sequential steps of systemic choice, change, and 
decision making enabling people to discover their own best choices that match 
the rules and values of their internal system. These steps traverse a pathway 
from the unconscious, where their habituated behaviors and status quo originates 
through to buy-in and Systems Congruence so change is comfortably adopted, 
without disruption. <p>
I have taught these skill sets to influencers in business, coaching, leadership, 
and healthcare to assist in facilitating permanent, congruent change: to help 
buyers buy, to help coaches, leaders, and doctors elicit congruent, permanent 
change, to help learners learn permanently - eliciting the core of the 
unconscious HOW to facilitate Another’s excellence their own way - to find their 
own answers.<p>
So what would you need to know or believe differently to be willing to begin 
interactions as a Servant Leader rather than a coach, parent, seller, leader? 
How can you know, given the skill sets and foundations are so different, that 
it’s worth taking the time to add new skill sets to the ones you already use? 
Imagine having the skills that truly enable Others to find their own Excellence. 
Imagine being a true Servant Leader.<p>
