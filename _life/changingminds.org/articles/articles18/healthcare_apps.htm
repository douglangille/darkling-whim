Healthcare Apps Can Facilitate Patient Compliance</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgan</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
There are currently more than 165,000 healthcare apps used for a variety of 
purposes - helping patients routinize new dietary choices and exercise programs, 
patient engagement, collecting measurements and feedback for providers, managing 
clinical trials, and care coordination to name a few. The virtual healthcare 
system is revolutionizing health care. It’s exciting. <p>
But to me, one element seems missing: other than a few attempts at behavior 
modification, I haven’t noticed any targeted capability to formalize lasting 
patient compliance. We’re providing patients the What and Why, but not doing 
such a great job on the How. It’s a conundrum: Why don’t patients do what they 
know they need to do? Why isn’t a rational argument, or a health scare, or trust 
in a provider, enough to inspire behavior change?<h2>
KNOWLEDGE DOESN’T ENABLE BEHAVIOR CHANGE</h2>
<p>
For those times we believe our patients need to change behaviors for improved 
health benefits, we’re not doing such a great job of helping them change. 
Indeed, we’re asking patients to change before they know how, causing resistance 
and non-compliance. But with a slight adjustment it’s possible to help them 
adopt and routinize new health-driven behaviors – in office or on apps - and 
avoid resistance completely. The first element to consider is behavior. What are 
behaviors, and why are they so hard to change?<p>
Behaviors are merely the expression – the representation - of our Beliefs; the 
translations of our values into practice; our Beliefs in action. Without Beliefs 
as the foundation of our actions, new behaviors have no source. <p>
Think of it this way: behaviors express our Beliefs much like the functionality 
of a software program – the upward movement of an arm on a robot, for example - 
is a result of the programming. To change the output, to make the robot’s arm do 
something different, you don’t start by changing the functionality; you first 
change the coding, the programming that causes the robot’s arm to move. A change 
in the programming will automatically change the functionality. It’s the same 
with people: our behaviors merely carry out what our internal programming (our 
human system, as I call it) dictates, regardless of the problems that result or 
the efficacy of a solution that might adjust them.<h2>
CHANGE IS A SYSTEMS PROBLEM</h2>
<p>
Each of us operates out of a unique, unconscious, human, adaptive system of 
rules and goals, beliefs and values, history and foundational norms that enable 
us to show up every day and operate in our own unique way. Our personal system 
is our status quo. It represents who we are and the organizing principles that 
we wake up with. It’s habituated, normalized, accepted, and replicated day after 
day, year after year, including what created and maintains our potentially 
flawed behaviors. It’s who we are, the identity and internal rules and Beliefs 
from which we derive our politics and religion and opinions; and we’ll do 
whatever it takes to maintain it and remain congruent – operate daily as who we 
know ourselves to be. The problems – the bugs, inadequacies, bad habits, quirks 
and personality traits - are baked in; we adopt clever, idiosyncratic 
workarounds to maintain them because, well, they’re part of our system and we 
adapt: gaining weight? Buy a bigger size. Coughing a lot? Suck on lozenges. <p>
When we offer patients suggestions that haven’t been incorporated into their 
system, we’re actually threatening who they are and how they see themselves; 
regardless of their need to change or the efficacy of the offered solution, 
we’re actually asking people to 
<ul>
	<li>act incongruently, </li>
	<li>change without giving them the means to, </li>
	<li>take on new actions that have not been programmed in to their system,
	</li>
	<li>get buy-in from the very rules that created the problem to begin with.
	</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
Of course we offer healthy options. But that’s not the point; their resistance 
is unconscious. Until or unless someone recognizes that a proposed change won’t 
cause permanent disruption to who they are, AND can discover how their beliefs, 
goals and routines can safely, congruently expand to include new behaviors, AND 
manage any fallout in a way that leaves the system butter-side-up, people will 
not change regardless of their need or your solution.<h2>
PATIENT EXAMPLE</h2>
	<p>
Here’s a very simple example. Years ago, my neighbor Maria came over crying. It 
seems she was just diagnosed as pre-diabetic and had to change her eating habits 
including discontinuing her beloved tortillas. As a Hispanic woman with a very 
large family living nearby, she was known as Tortilla Abuela and supplied 
tortillas for all family functions. There were kids and grandkids around all the 
time seeking tortillas; Abuela was constantly at the stove making them. I’m not 
sure I ever saw her without her apron on. Of course she and her husband Joe ate 
them at every meal.<p>
I brought her to Whole Foods and we found healthy non-grain flour and types of 
healthier shortening, but we knew it wouldn’t be the same. Maria gallantly tried 
for two weeks but she and the family were miserable; she finally gave up and 
went back to the lard and starch. “What can I do? It’s who I am.” she said.<p>
I posed a Facilitative Question to help her figure out how to make change and 
still remain compliant with her Beliefs and status quo:<p class="quote">
<b>Facilitative Question</b>: What would you need to know or believe differently to be 
able to provide your family the food they depend on you for, and still eat in a 
healthy way so you’ll be cooking for them for a long, long time?<p class="quote">
<b>Answer</b>: I’d need to find a new way to get them tortillas that taste like mine, 
replace what I can’t eat with healthy options that my family will still love, 
and still be the one they depend on for favorite foods.<p>
Now we had a direction to go. Food and tortillas were part of her core identity 
– baked in to her system, and necessary for her to maintain her role as family 
nourisher. We set about finding a route through to health AND food AND family. 
On reflection, Maria recognized her daughter Susanna made tortillas almost as 
good as hers, and, aside from her famous tortillas, her family loved her green 
enchiladas (sans tortillas, they were healthy and compliant with her doc’s 
suggestions) almost as much as her tortillas. <p>
Her workaround was quite creative, one that I, as an outsider to her family, 
could never have conceived. She invited everyone over for dinner and served her 
famous enchiladas. Then, in grand presentation fashion complete with a bow, 
formally handed the tortilla implements to Susanna. She announced that because 
of her new health issues that kept her from eating tortillas, Susanna would now 
be Tortilla Tia but she’d still be making the green enchiladas for every family 
function. The family would get their tortillas and their enchiladas, and have a 
healthy Abuela.<h2>
WHAT TO ADD TO HEALTHCARE APPS</h2>
	<p>
In our passion as healthcare providers we forget that regardless of our bona 
fides, the patient’s need, or the trust we’ve acquired, we’re outsiders: we 
cannot effect change for the patient; they must design their own path to 
congruent change. <p>
When we design apps that offer patients our choices, ask patients for 
information we need, and don’t include an ability for them to design their own 
path to compliance in line with their own system of Beliefs, rules and 
experiences, we’re overlooking the need to facilitate patients through their 
change process. <p>
Over the past decades, I’ve developed a Change Facilitation model I’ve taught to 
sales people, coaches, and leaders that facilitates their internal, personal 
decision path through to congruent change. In the sales industry, I’ve trained 
Buying Facilitation® for the past 35 years to many global corporations – around 
100,000 people in companies such as IBM, Kaiser, Cancer Treatment Center of 
America, Morgan Stanley, KPMG, DuPont, California Closets, etc. – to results 
that far exceed those achieved by the sales model alone (In pilot studies, we’ve 
consistently achieved close rates of 40% using the same list that the control 
groups closed 5%.); we teach potential buyers - regardless of the 
price/complexity of a solution - how to organize themselves around the change of 
adding a new solution before we sell. In other words, this model has already 
been tested. <p>
It involves several skills to facilitate unbiased guidance to help people make 
their unconscious more conscious, including 1. a new type of question that acts 
as a GPS to guide people along their own normalized, idiosyncratic route of 
change; 2. stops along each of the 13 change steps that all human systems 
traverse to make congruent change. Here’s a brief overview of two of the skills 
involved with the process:<p>
<b>Facilitative Questions:</b> a new form of question that uses specific non-biased 
words in a specific sequence to lead people through their own internal, 
congruent, change process, to avoid resistance and advance discovery. They’re 
not information gathering, pull, manipulative, or biased by the needs of the 
Questioner; it’s a sort of GPS that efficiently moves people, without bias, 
through their own largely unconscious systems to design a path to congruent 
change while creating trust along the way [Note: especially on an app, it’s 
important to establish a ‘trusting relationship’ with users.]. Usually asked 
within a series, here’s a very simplistic example of a Facilitative Question.
<p class="quote">
How would you know if it were time to reconsider your hairstyle? <p>
As a contrast, here’s a simple conventional information-pull question that 
matches the needs and biases of the Questioner (and note: all conventional 
questions are information-pull, driven by the [biased] needs of the questioner):
<p class="quote">
Why do you wear your hair like that? <p>
It’s possible to design Facilitative Questions in a generic fashion that can<ul>
		<li>traverse the sequence a patient’s brain uses to </li>
		<li>recognize the norms that must be addressed,</li>
		<li>adapt the status quo, add and routinize new behaviors congruently,
		</li>
		<li>facilitate buy-in, Belief change, and compliance with new programs
		</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
as an add-on to healthcare apps. Additionally, it’s possible to message our 
questions and requests - patient intake forms and surveys, search for patients 
who will remain compliant during the length of a study, the incorporation of 
family to support the change - so patients can respond without resistance.<p>
<b>Change Facilitation</b>: although patients know there’s something wrong and probably 
should do something differently, they can’t permanently change until their 
system<ul>
			<li>recognizes how, when, and where to change without anhialation or disruption,</li>
			<li>doesn’t feel threatened or resistant and achieves buy-in from the effected 
parts,</li>
			<li>designs a route between the old and the new in a way that maintains Systems 
Congruence. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
Our apps can add a front-end feature that employs Facilitative Questions in the 
right sequence, to lead patients through their own idiosyncratic steps of change 
so they can plot a path that matches their own Beliefs, rules, and life 
experience. We can enable healthcare apps to first facilitate patient buy-in, 
highlight their potential points of resistance as the change progresses, and 
help them design a route through to congruent, enduring compliance, regardless 
of the change desired - routinized exercise and food regimens, patient 
retention, patient engagement, and data collection for example. <p>
I’d like to help be part of the effort that affords patients the ability to 
choose health, positioning providers to be true Servant Leaders. I look forward 
to working with the healthcare industry to optimize patient engagement.<p>
