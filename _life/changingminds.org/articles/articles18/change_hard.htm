Why Change Seems So Hard: Essay on facilitating buy-in and avoiding 
resistance</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
How do we manage change in our organizations? Not very well, apparently. 
According to statistics, the success rate for many planned change 
implementations is low: 37 percent for Total Quality Management; 30 percent for 
Reengineering and Business Process Reengineering, and a whopping 97% for some 
software implementations. Regardless of the industry, situation, levels of 
people involved, or intended outcome, change seems to be sabotaged in unknown 
ways, causing the real possibility of failure:<ul>
	<li>Internal partners fail in attempts to promote and elicit proposed change 
initiatives across departments.</li>
	<li>Leaders get blindsided by unknowns, creating more problems or becoming part of 
the problem when attempting to find a fix.</li>
	<li>The system gets disrupted during the change process, unwittingly harming 
people, relationships, and initiatives.</li>
	<li>Improper, or non-existent, integration between developers and users cause lack 
of buy-in and resistance.</li>
	<li>The change doesn’t get adopted as conceived, with financial and personal 
fallout.</li>
	<li>Is it possible that our approach is causing some of the problems? I submit that 
we’re omitting some of the foundational elements to congruent change, change 
that can be successful in:</li>
	<li>its comfortable transitions between phases;</li>
	<li>its ease of buy-in;</li>
	<li>enabling all participants to embrace leadership roles and be a part of 
designing and developing the Rules and Beliefs that will define the emerging, 
new system;</li>
	<li>reducing fallout and cost;</li>
	<li>eliminating resistance, </li>
	<li>encouraging creativity.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
But we’ll need to do something different from what we’re currently doing. <h2>
THE SYSTEMS ASPECT OF CHANGE</h2>
	<p>
Let’s begin at the beginning with my definitions of change and systems.<p>
<b>CHANGE</b>: Change is a new set of choices within a system that cause the elements 
of the system to exhibit altered Behaviors while still maintaining homeostasis. 
No change can occur unless the system reorients (i.e. re-organizes, 
re-prioritizes etc.) itself in a way that incorporates and maintains its core 
accepted norms (i.e. homeostasis, Systems Congruence). In other words, all 
change must include a way for the elements to ultimately buy-in to, and 
incorporate, new functioning while maintaining the rules and Beliefs of the 
status quo. <p>
<b>SYSTEM</b>: Any connected set of elements that comprise a homeostatic entity, held 
together by consensual rules and Beliefs that then generate a unique set of Behaviors that exhibit its unique identity. All systems must maintain Systems 
Congruence or they lose their identity and become something else. Because change 
represents the disruption of the status quo in unknowable ways, systems defend 
themselves by resisting when feeling threatened. In order to facilitate 
congruent change, it’s necessary to get the agreement, and a recognized path 
forward (There are specific, sequential steps in all change processes.), of all 
of the bits that will be effected by the final solution to ensure it maintains 
its core identity, Beliefs, and rules. <p>
As a lifelong student of systems thinking and theorizing (50+ years), I’ve 
recognized that change is often approached with an eye on altering activity and 
Behaviors without addressing the vital need for the core system to maintain 
homeostasis. And when we tie our understanding of the functionality of a system 
to its Behaviors and attempt to push Behavior change before eliciting core 
Belief change, we<ul>
		<li>overlook the ability to facilitate the system down its own path through to 
it&#39;s own version of congruent change </li>
		<li>are relegated to managing the fallout when the stable system reaches Cognitive 
Dissonance and is forced to defend itself.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
Herein lie the problem: until or unless the full complement of relevent elements 
(that not only created the problem but holds it in place daily) agrees to 
congruently alter, and get buy-in from, the elements that caused the problem and 
will be effected by any change, it will resist change regardless of the 
underlying problem that needs fixing. The system is sacrosanct. And it applies 
whether trying to get a teenager to pick up his socks, a diabetic patient to 
exercise, a team to work harmoniously, or a person to figure out if/when she 
needs to buy something. In general, outsiders cannot effect congruent change 
because they cannot know the core elements that have created and maintain the 
status quo, nor how to re-orient them congruently around any proposed change. 
It&#39;s an inside job. <p>
With our focus on changing Behaviors, we’ve overlooked the need for a system to 
maintain Systems Congruence – the foundational rules, Beliefs, relationships, 
etc. that define the system. Outside influencers – regardless of their 
initiatives or rationality or persuasiveness or authority – can never understand 
a system they’re not a part of. Change must begin by teaching the system how to 
change itself. I’ve written this article to:<ul>
			<li>Explain how current approaches to change management lead to resistance,</li>
			<li>Introduce the elements of change and need for buy-in,</li>
			<li>Introduce a route to change that can achieve goals without resistance while 
maximizing leadership and creativity through buy-in and congruent change.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
In my forthcoming book (tentatively titled Facilitating Change) I’ll explore 
this topic thoroughly. In this article I’ll introduce the important elements and 
lay out my thinking. And I look forward to your feedback.<h2>
ALL PROBLEMS START WITH SYSTEMS</h2>
			<p>
Most influencing professions (leadership, coaching, consulting, sales etc.) 
begin with a goal to be met, adopt an outside-in approach that uses influence, 
advice, ‘rational’ scientific ‘facts’, and various types of manipulation to 
inspire change – while ignoring the fact that anything new, any push from 
outside the system, any dissimilar element not already within it, represents 
disruption and Cognitive Dissonance. We put the cart before the horse, 
attempting to change Behaviors and elicit buy in before the system is certain it 
won’t be compromised and knows how to make sure it survives. Until the necessary 
steps of change are completed and the system knows it will maintain Systems 
Congruence, the identified problem will continue as is: it’s already built into 
the system:<ul>
				<li>The full complement of elements and that created the problem and represent the 
status quo must be assembled and recognized [Note: this applies to making an 
individual decision since each of us is an individual system.];</li>
				<li>Everyone/everything within the system must accept that it’s not possible to 
fix the problem with known resources;</li>
				<li>All of the elements (people, policies, rules, relationships, etc.) that will 
be effected by a new solution – i.e. change – must begin by understanding, 
buying-in to, and accounting for, the ways they’d be changing to ensure the path 
they design for better funtioning leads them to homeostasis. </li>
				</ul>
<p>Until all that happens the system will resist change (or buying, or learning, 
or eating healthy or or) regardless of the level of need or the efficacy of the 
solution. And because of the unconscious, historic elements involved, for 
congruent change to occur, those inside the system must design their own route 
to acceptable change. And as outside influencers we actually cause our own 
resistance by pushing our agendas, when we can actually lead Others through to 
their own change.<p>
By assuming a Behavior addition/subtraction is ‘rational’ or necessary, without 
accounting for whatever workaround the system has already adopted and built in 
to its daily functioning, we end up with far more failure and resistance than we 
should have given the efficacy of our solutions. Indeed, it’s necessary to 
elicit buy-in for each element that will be changed: to maintain congruence 
throughout the change process, systems must<ul>
					<li>Maintain Functional Stability. Systems must maintain homeostasis. Their 
current functioning, even when problematic, has been finely honed over time, 
waking up every day maintaining the Behaviors, rules, goals, etc. that created 
the problem to begin with. Change is not so simple as shoving in a new Behavior. 
Remember: a system doesn’t judge itself as ‘good’ or ‘bad’. It just is. And it 
keeps ticking over the same way day after day.</li>
					<li>Achieve Buy-In. Whether consciously or unconsciously, a system will resist 
anything from outside that threatens the status quo, regardless of the efficacy 
of the change. For successful change to occur, the system must recognize exactly 
what fallout will occur when anything shifts or is added, and how each affected 
element must modify itself in a way that maintains the integrity of the system 
(i.e. Systems Congruence). I can’t say this enough: the system is sacrosanct, 
quite separate from whatever reasons an influencer uses to change it.</li>
					<li>Maintain Underlying Rules and Beliefs. Great data or solutions, important 
needs or dangerous consequences do not influence the change if they run counter 
to the system’s homeostatic Beliefs and rules, overt or covert. (It’s why your 
Uncle Vinny still smokes with lung cancer, and why training doesn’t cause new 
behaviors.) Note when we attempt change a set of Behaviors without changing the 
underlying Beliefs that created those Behaviors to begin with, we cause 
resistance. And here’s a tip: when you start from inside out, from eliciting any 
change within a system’s Beliefs and rules (i.e. rather than ‘Eat your 
broccoli,’ start with ‘I’m a Healthy Person.’), new behaviors will automatically 
accompany them. Unfortunately, it doesn’t work the other way ‘round: when we 
attempt to push a new Behavior into the system – say, asking a heart patient to 
change her diet or exercise program - before eliciting Belief change from the 
entire (and largely unconscious) system, we will achieve resistance as it may be 
seen as a threat. It cannot be otherwise. </li>
					</ul>
<p>The issues are the same regardless of the focus, whether it’s a company 
resisting reorganization, a patient refusing meds, a user group resisting new 
software, a buyer who hasn’t figured out when, if, how to buy, or a group not 
taking direction from company leadership. As outsiders we too often push for our 
own results and actually cause the resistance that occurs. </p>
<p>It’s possible to use our positions as outside influencers eschew our bias and 
be real Servant Leaders and teach the system how to traverse each step of its 
own change.<p>
</p>
<h2>CASE STUDY: SYSTEMS ALIGNMENT</h2>
					<p>
</p>
<p>Here is a case study that exhibits how to enable buy-in and congruent change 
management by facilitating a potential buyer through her unique systems issues 
en route to a purchasing decision. Note: All change situations (whether 
coaching, leadership, software implementations, family problems, healthcare 
initiatives, etc.) must go through a series of steps to change to achieve buy 
in. Until now, we’ve left Others to manage the route through to the steps of 
change on their own as we push, advocate, advise, influence, manipulate for our 
own agendas and then we blame them when they resist - not to mention potentially 
not even reach their own internal route to change.<p>
I was with a client in Scotland when he received a call from a long-standing 
prospect – a Learning and Development manager at a prodigious university with 
whom he’d been talking for 11 months – to say, “Thanks, but no thanks” for the 
product purchase. After three product trials that met with acclaim and 
excitement, an agreed-upon price, and a close relationship developed over the 
course of a year, what happened? The software was a perfect solution; they were 
not speaking to any other providers; and price didn’t seem to be a problem.<p>
At my client’s request, I called the L&amp;D manager. Here is the conversation:<p class="quote">
SDM: Hi, Linda. Sharon Drew here. Is this a good time to speak? Pete said you’d 
be waiting for my call around now.<p class="quote">
LR: Yes, it’s fine. How can I help? I already told Pete that we wouldn’t be 
purchasing the software.<p class="quote">
SDM: I heard. You must be so sad that you couldn’t purchase it at this time.<p class="quote">
LR: I am! I LOVE the technology! It’s PERFECT for us. I’m so disappointed.<p class="quote">
SDM: What stopped you from being able to purchase it?<p class="quote">
LR: We have this new HR director with whom I share a leadership role. He is so 
contentious that few people are willing to deal with him. After meeting with 
him, I get migraines that leave me in bed. I’ve decided to limit my exposure to 
him, discussing only things that are emergencies. So I’ve put a stop to all 
communication with him just to keep me sane. He would have been my business 
partner on this purchase.<p class="quote">
SDM: Sounds awful. I hear that because of the extreme personal issues you’ve 
experience from the relationship, you don’t have a way to get the necessary 
buy-in from this man to help your employees who might need additional tools to 
do their jobs better.<p class="quote">
LR: Wow. You’re right. That’s exactly what I’ve done. Oh my. I’m going to have 
to figure that out because I’ve certainly got a responsibility to the employees.<p class="quote">
SDM: What would you need to know or believe differently to be willing to work 
through the personal issues and figure out how to be in some sort of a working 
relationship with the HR director for those times your employees need new 
tools?*<p class="quote">
LR: Could you send me some of these great questions you’re asking me so I can 
figure it out, and maybe use them on him?<p>
I sent her a half dozen *Facilitative Questions to both teach her how to design 
a route to her own sanity and a path to healthy collaborative partnership with 
the HR Director. Two weeks later, Linda called back to purchase the solution. 
What happened?<ol>
						<li>While the university had a need for my products solution, the poor 
relationship between the HR director and the L&amp;D director created hidden, 
ongoing dysfunction. The information flow problem could not be resolved while 
the hidden problem remained in place - details not only hidden from the sales 
person (outsider) but used as a deterrent by Linda (who didn’t know how to 
resolve the problem other than to walk away because her own internal system had 
been violated). So yes, there was a need for the solution and indeed a willing 
partner, but no, there was no systemic buy-in for change.</li>
						<li>I stayed completely away from attempting to resolve the problem by sharing, 
gathering, pitching information or my reasons why change (i.e. buying my 
solution) was necessary. (Not only is information not needed until the system 
knows what information it needs - if you haven’t figured out what type of car 
you want to buy there’s no need to hear a pitch about a Lamborghini - but the 
bias involved in sharing it and gathering it restricts success. There&#39;s plenty 
of time to offer our solutions when we can pitch it relevantly, according to the 
way the system is set up to use it.). The only viable route was to help her 
figure out her own route to a fix. </li>
						<li>This was not a sales problem (It’s always a ‘systems change’ problem, rarely 
a ‘coaching’ problem or an ‘implementation’ problem) – the Behaviors/outcomes 
were merely representing a broken system. I had to facilitate the change by 
enabling Linda to resolve her own system. This is how current change management 
models fail: they attempt to rule, govern, constrict, manage, influence, 
maintain the change, rather than enabling the system to recognize and mitigate 
its own unique (and largely unconscious) drivers and change itself congruently.</li>
						<li>There was no way for the system to fix itself as long as the L&amp;D director – 
merely one piece of the systemic puzzle that created the problem to begin with – 
didn’t know how to develop additional choices for herself. Her choice to do 
nothing was an ode to Systems Congruence. </li>
						<li>In Linda’s unconscious decision to forgo a problem fix to maintain her own 
personal homeostasis, she unconsciously weighted her personal criteria above her 
criteria for doing her job. In order to buy the solution, she’d need to find a 
way to ensure personal Systems Congruence.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
Linda was willing to separate her work-related decision from her personal issues 
and reevaluate her choices once she realized there was a way to maintain her 
internal homeostasis AND fix the problem.<p class="quote">
<b>Rule</b>: Until or unless people grasp how a solution will match their underlying 
criteria/values, and until there is buy-in from the parts that will be effected 
from the change, no permanent change will happen regardless of the necessity of 
the change, the size of the need, the origination of the request, or the 
efficacy of the solution.<p>
Current change management models assume that a ‘rational’, 
information/rules-based change request and early client engagement will supplant 
the system&#39;s need for homeostasis. <p>
Focusing instead on effecting Behavior change as per the route, goal, 
assumptions, needs of the influencer. Indeed, even when change agents attempt to 
include clients into the software design or change implementations, their 
questions and info sharing strategies are largely biased by their personal 
outcomes and unwittingly overlook the interdependency of core Beliefs, historic 
roles, unspoken rules and relationships, and unconscious drivers within the 
user&#39;s unconscious system.<p class="quote">
<b>Rule</b>: Whether it’s sales, leadership, healthcare, coaching or change management, 
until or unless the folks within another&#39;s system are willing to adapt to, and 
adopt, the requested change using their own rules and Beliefs, they will either 
take no action or resist to maintain the homeostasis of the system. The system 
is sacrosanct. And information push, rational argument, leadership directives, 
or any outside-in model threatens the system.<h2>
HOW BELIEFS, BEHAVIORS, AND BUY-IN EFFECT SYSTEMIC CHANGE</h2>
						<p>
Fortunately, it’s possible to highlight each pivotal element of change and get 
buy-in before attempting a change initiative. It requires an understanding of 
what, exactly, is a Behavior, and why starting by attempting to change the 
Behaviors/output of the system can only cause resistance.<p>
Behaviors are merely Beliefs in action – the physical transaction that 
exemplifies the underlying rules and values of the system. In other words, 
they’re the means a system uses to operate and perform its purpose - the end 
point, and certainly an ineffective place to begin change. <p>
Think of it this way. If you want your forward-moving robot to go backwards you 
might tell it why moving backward is beneficial, order it to move backward, 
offer scientific proof why moving backward is best, or push it. But until the 
internal programming is changed from the core, it cannot change regardless of 
how you position your request or push the robot backwards. Indeed, you might 
even break the robot in your attempts to get it to behave the way you want it to 
behave.<p>
Since it’s not possible for an outsider to lead from inside, we must teach the 
system how to lead itself, much like a GPS system leads a driver to a 
destination without actually being in the car or noticing the landscape. Like a 
GPS system, we begin by leading the system through its own idiosyncratic route 
to design its own change (i.e. like I helped Linda figure out her core issues 
(i.e. not our products) and how to communicate with the HR director) to ensure 
Systems Congruence, buy-in and leadership from within. Here are my rules to 
facilitating congruent change and buy-in:<ol>
							<li>Enter with no bias. Help the system define the elements that created the 
status quo and must buy in to the change. These include anything – jobs, people, 
initiatives, relationships, departments – that the new solution will touch. 
Rule: Entering the decision-navigation portion of the change experience with 
bias or a personal outcome will impede the process and create resistance. Change 
agents must listen for systems without a biased ear (see my new book on this 
topic – What? Did you really say what I think I heard?) and eschew attempting to 
introduce information until the system is set up to change, knows what it needs 
to know (usually quite different from what we think it needs) and has achieved 
buy-in.</li>
							<li>Help the system recognize all of the parts – the people, rules, 
relationships, presuppositions, workarounds – that created and maintain the 
status quo. Rule: Until or unless the system recognizes all of the factors, 
knows how they have contributed to the problems in the status quo, and ensures 
that they buy in to the change, it will not be able to give agreement.</li>
							<li>Help the system figure out how to reorganize around the new change so it will 
not face disruption and will have all of the pieces in place to accommodate the 
change. Rule: The change cycle is the time it takes for the system to figure out 
its own trajectory so there will be minimal disruption during the change 
process.</li>
							</ol>
							<h2>
BUY-IN: A REAL WORLD EXAMPLE</h2>
<p>
Joseph, a coaching client of mine, was a CMO in a small company (around 150 
employees) had a problem: He wanted to implement a new customer-service 
initiative but had just joined the company and was fearful of making waves. He 
initially wanted to design the project, issue edicts, and fire those who didn’t 
comply with the initiative. After casually speaking with a few people about it, 
he got huge resistance.<p>
He called me in when he realized he had to choose between enforcing the 
Behaviors and outcomes he had in mind, or creating the structure and teaching 
the employees how to become creative leaders who would design their own 
congruent process. I helped him build a creative structure for congruent change, 
which meant giving up some of the details of his plan while maintaining the 
congruence of what the outcome looked like. Joseph put together a list of his 
baseline criteria and then left open the financials, job descriptions, 
activities, and other decisions:<ol>
								<li>Maintain the company’s integrity, professionalism, and level of service;</li>
								<li>Design a mix between technology and human interaction;</li>
								<li>Provide customers with better access to more data, have ease of use for any 
information they needed, and meet their needs more proactively;</li>
								<li>Create award-winning service that would differentiate the company from all 
competitors and keep customers over time.</li>
								</ol>
								<p>
He called a meeting with the entire company – even groups that the change 
process wouldn’t necessarily touch – and told them that he was thinking about 
expanding the customer service operations. He asked everyone to take a few hours 
to discuss, think about, and brainstorm what it could look like if they had an 
unlimited budget (which they didn’t have, but it would eliminate the money piece 
from their brainstorming), and said he’d meet with them the next week to get 
their ideas.<p>
He told them that this process was highly important, and he wanted it to be part 
of people’s daily discussions over the next week. He asked that each group have 
a spokesperson and historian to keep track of all ideas.<p>
The next week, Joseph met with employees again and asked for their input. He 
captured the ideas by audio and put them all up on an interactive website for 
the new ideas and told people to add their thoughts. He then sent them back to 
consider the ideas offered and generate even more.<p>
At the next meeting, he asked workers to take all of the ideas now floating 
around and use them to brainstorm what the new initiative would look like, who 
might do what, what would have to change, and what the change would look like 
for those involved. He asked them to consider:<ol>
									<li>What jobs would change? What jobs would be added/subtracted – and what would 
happen with the people whose jobs might be affected?</li>
									<li>What needed to stay the same internally, no matter what? And how could this 
be included in the new initiative?</li>
									<li>What might be the possible fall-out from the staff and from customers?</li>
									<li>What could get in the way of a successful change initiative?</li>
									</ol>
									<p>
Eventually, employees got into teams and developed solid implementation plans. 
Those folks who had to change jobs or had their work significantly restructured 
in a way that might cause resistance joined a management team or focus group and 
became part of the solution. And throughout the process, I listened carefully to 
hear points of discontinuity so we could stop and go through their internal 
examination of their steps to change. <p>
Did Joseph get everything he wanted? Well, yes and no. The new organization 
ended up far exceeding anything he had conceived. It had more creativity and 
leadership. It also cost more than he realized (time and money) to put 
everything in place. But it elicited buy-in from everyone: there was no 
resistance because everyone had bought in to the idea and made it their own. And 
over a short amount of time, the change paid for itself.<p>
This is only one method of facilitating change and avoiding resistance. I’ve 
developed a Change Facilitation model, used often in sales as Buying 
Facilitation®, that uses a unique skill set to enable core change. I’ve trained 
this to Senior Partners at recognized consulting firms, farmers in Iowa, tech 
people in Hong Kong, coaches in Kansas. It’s a generic model that influencers 
can use to elicit real change. I’m happy to discuss it with you (Sharondrew@sharondrewmorgen.com).<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
									<p>
Before introducing any change initiative, give up the need to push the change, 
listen without bias, and enable Others to traverse their route to discovery:<ul>
										<li>what elements created and maintain the status quo,</li>
										<li>who needs to be included (often a larger group than anticipated),</li>
										<li>recognize what would get in the way of success and what needs to happen to 
mitigate that interference,</li>
										<li>figure out how to manage the workarounds in place that attempt to mitigate the 
problem,</li>
										<li>notice levels of buy-in and help those who resist shift their personal 
criteria to become part of the group,</li>
										<li>get agreement, steps, criteria, and Behaviors for an intact, non-resistant, 
functioning system that welcomes the new initiative. Then introduce the change.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>
</p>
<p>Until now, we’ve assumed that resistance is a normal part of the change 
process. But we’ve effectively been pushing our own biased needs for change into 
a closed, hidden system. We’ve ignored the rule of systems and forgotten that 
the change we are suggesting will encounter a status quo that is trying to 
maintain homeostasis. But as we’ve explored above, it is possible to get buy-in 
without resistance. We don’t have to throw out the many wonderful change models 
out there. But we first need to get buy-in, and then the change will be welcomed 
rather than spurned or sabotaged.<p>
