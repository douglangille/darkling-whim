The Real "Buyer’s Journey" or, the reason selling doesn't cause buying</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I moved to London in 1983 to start up a tech company after spending years as a 
successful sales person. After years of ‘understanding’ and ‘qualifying’ 
prospects, getting appointments and networking, presenting and following up, I 
thought I understood buyers well-enough to become one. But I was wrong. My new 
role taught me the differences between selling and buying: I hadn’t realized how 
the complexity of my Pre-Sales activity determined whether or not I’d buy:<ul>
	<li>As a sales professional my ultimate job was to place solutions; as a buyer, my 
main focus was to create and maintain Excellence. </li>
	<li>As a sales professional I struggled to say/offer the right thing, at the right 
time, to the right prospects, in order to close; as an entrepreneur and 
potential buyer I had to continually manage change using the most efficient, 
integrous, and least disruptive route to success to maintain happy employees and 
clients, and a great product.</li>
	<li>As a sales professional, I sought to influence those who needed my solution; as 
a buyer, I couldn’t fully define my needs, make adjustments, or resolve 
problems, until all voices and impediments to change were factored in.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
Selling and buying were different: different goals, different behaviors, 
different communication and thinking patterns. And before becoming a buyer 
myself, I hadn’t fully appreciated how severely the sales model limits itself to 
seeking and finding only the low hanging fruit – those who have gone through 
their internal systems checks and realized they cannot fix their problem 
themselves and know, precisely, the sort of solution that would be acceptable 
and cost effective.<p>
As a buyer, the very last thing I needed was to buy. But when I did buy, it was 
based on my ability to manage change without disruption, not on my need. Even 
though I had needs, my vendors didn’t close me until almost a year after they 
met me; if they had entered to first help me address my change I could have 
closed/bought months earlier. <h2>
THE JOB OF A BUYER</h2>
	<p>
As a buyer, my problem was not having needs but in addressing any disruption I&#39;d 
face in addressing the needs: before bringing in anything new in, I had to first 
enable congruent change along a murky path between the status quo, and 
Excellence and respect<ul>
		<li>the rules and brand of the company, </li>
		<li>the well-being of the employees and staff,</li>
		<li>the integrity of the product or service provided, </li>
		<li>the congruence and integrity of the status quo,</li>
		<li>the needs of the customers. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>
The challenge was to be better without losing what worked successfully, to 
ensure 
		<ul>
			<li>everyone involved agreed to a common solution, </li>
			<li>I had consensus and a route through to congruent change, </li>
			<li>I was absolutely certain I couldn’t fix the problem with something convenient 
or familiar, </li>
			<li>I managed a range of idiosyncratic decision factors that involved my 
investors, my Board, my staff, </li>
			<li>I had all my ducks in a row and considered any needs in terms of systems 
congruence, and</li>
			<li>I made sure any change or purchase maintained our status quo or created a new 
one congruently.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
Even though I was the Managing Director/Founder, it wasn’t totally up to me how, 
if, or when to resolve problems. I had a well-oiled machine to consider, one 
that had a few problems, but did a lot successfully; I didn’t want to throw the 
baby out with the bathwater. I had to discern how to reach Excellence in the 
most efficient way and create the least disruption to the employees, company and 
investors. And the last thing – the very last thing I needed was to buy 
anything. 
			<ul>
				<li>Who did I need to get agreement from? And how would their combined voices 
shift the thoughts on the needs, the outcome, and the process? What was the 
fallout if I forgot some of the voices?</li>
				<li>What would be the inflection point between the risk of change and the reward 
of Excellence? </li>
				<li>How could we fix the problem ourselves? At what point would we realize we 
couldn’t? </li>
				<li>How could we be certain that the people, policies, rules, and goals we had in 
place would fit comfortably – would buy-in with anything new we might do? And 
was it possible to know the downside?</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
Once I realized that my needs were not the driving factors, and the change issue 
was a problem of Systems Congruence (I had to maintain what worked and find a 
way to expand the status quo to adopt the new) I used my Asperger’s 
systems-thinking brain to code the 13 steps from problems to Excellence and 
design a change facilitation model (Buying Facilitation®) so my sales staff 
could sell more: 
				<ul>
					<li>Assemble all the right people – decision makers and influencers of all types – 
to get consensus for any change at all. This proved to be challenging and not 
obvious to discern all – all – of the people who had to be included;</li>
					<li>Enable a route of discovery through collaboration so all voices, all concerns, 
were added into the mix and get approved for action by a consensus. This was a 
systems-change issue, not a solution-choice issue;</li>
					<li>Find out if there was a cheap, easy, risk-free way to fix problems with 
groups, policies, technology we already had in place;</li>
					<li>Discover the risks of change and how we’d handle them;</li>
					<li>Realize the point where there was no route to Excellence without bringing in a 
new/different solution;</li>
					<li>Manage the fallout of change when bringing something new in from outside, and 
determine how to congruently integrate a purchase into our status quo.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
The change process we all went through was idiosyncratic and iterative (My book 
Dirty Little Secrets describes the process.). No outsider would ever understand 
what was involved during our change process; even I didn’t understand what would 
be involved when I began. What surprised me most was that only the last 4 steps 
were involved with making a purchase. And my journey to a purchase was defined 
by my Buying Decision Path. Indeed, I coined this entire process the Buyer’s 
Journey. </p>
<h2>A WALK THROUGH THE BUYER’S JOURNEY </h2>
<p>Initially, like all buyers, I didn’t know what I didn’t know: I didn’t know 
WHO really needed to be involved (It wasn’t obvious due to the hidden influence 
from some of the folks peripherally involved.); I couldn’t know if we could FIX 
THE PROBLEM OURSELVES (Once we reached consensus as to the nature of the 
problem, we needed to attempt to use our most familiar resolutions.); I didn’t 
know IF I needed to buy anything (I merely wanted excellence. A purchase is 
disruptive and couldn’t be considered until all else was proven lacking.); and 
it wasn’t until there were no other options, did we consider seeking an outside 
solution. </p>
<p>In other words, even though we had needs, buying anything was not the 
objective nor the first thought. When I had an idea of something that needed 
improvement I needed to hear from the appropriate folks to flush out their 
issues before we’d have a complete fact pattern; we all had to agree to the 
goals, direction, outcomes, results, risks, and path to change – confusing 
because every voice and job title had different priorities, needs, and problems. 
It was a delicate process, and there was no clear path forward until we were 
almost at the end of the path. Every buyer goes through some form of this; they 
never begin at the end where sales enters. </p>
<p>This is where buyers go when they’re silent. They’re not dragging their heels 
or seeking lower prices; they need to traverse their entire Buying Journey to 
get to the point of even becoming a buyer. And the process of navigating through 
the people and policies within the status quo to garner consensus for a 
potentially disruptive change is a confusing process. It certainly can’t be 
driven by knowing about, or considering, an external solution. </p>
<p>As a seller I recommended my prospects include the ‘right’ people; I even 
attempted to help them make good decisions. But I was an outsider. And I was 
biased by my directive of wanting to sell, or understanding how my solution 
would fit; no one from outside the system could ever understand the internal 
politics and relationship issues to be managed. As an entrepreneur there was no 
one to guide me through this; not schooled in systems thinking, I had to figure 
out how to navigate this minefield on my own. <p>
This is the Buyer’s Journey – the route from the problem recognition, to the 
assembling of the appropriate people (idiosyncratic; not obvious), to the 
research and trials and workarounds to fix the problem with known resources, to 
the change management issues, to the point of defining the type of solution that 
will resolve the problem with least disruption. <p>
The act of selling, I realized, does not create buying. But with a different hat 
on, by entering first as Change Facilitators, sellers could enter the Buyer’s 
Journey at the beginning and efficiently help prospects navigate through the 
confusion first, to enable those who will buy, end contact immediately with 
those who cannot, and then gather data, pitch, and sell with very specific data 
and a familiar buyer. <h2>
NAVIGATING THROUGH THE ENTIRE JOURNEY: THE JOB OF BUYING FACILITATION®</h2>
					<p>
My own sellers used Buying Facilitation® as their first tool even when prospects 
would call in to us, to guide buyers through their own 13 steps, and then sell 
to the ones who had all their ducks in a row (We had an eight-fold increase in 
sales). The time it takes buyers to navigate these steps is the length of the 
sales cycle. And buyers must do this anyway – so it might as well be with us. 
Sellers wait (and wait) while buyers do this and then hopefully be there to pick 
off the low-hanging-fruit. Might as well start at the beginning, be Servant 
Leaders, and find/close more buyers.<p>
As part of Buying Facilitation® I coined the terms Buyer’s Journey, Buy Cycle, 
Buying Decision Path, Buying Patterns, Buying Decision Team, and Helping Buyers 
Buy between 1985 and 1993: 
					<ul>
						<li>Buying Decision Path represents the set of 13 steps from problem recognition and 
garnering consensus, through to recognizing and managing change in a way that 
enhances the status quo – all before getting to the stage of purchasing 
anything. It’s possible to facilitate and discover those who could buy and 
efficiently help them navigate the steps to purchase and get into the Buying 
Decision Team. A buying decision is a change management process. </li>
						<li>Buy Cycle represents the time it takes from recognition to Excellence, from 
seeking internal solutions to making a purchase. It’s a change management 
process, not a solution choice process.</li>
						<li>Buying Patterns explains the unique and idiosyncratic actions each buyer takes 
along their journey to Excellence.</li>
						<li>Buyer’s Journey includes the full fact pattern and set of decision and change 
issues between discovery and decision to buy anything and manage change. This is 
not merely a journey to a purchase. It’s a journey to Excellence.</li>
						<li>Buying Facilitation® is a generic change facilitation model for influencers 
(sellers, coaches, leaders, managers) that helps buyers traverse and uncover 
their hidden path to change with Systmes Congruence and consensus. It includes a 
unique set of tools that includes Listening for Systems, a Choice Model, and 
Facilitative Questions. Buying Facilitation® demands a systems thinking brain 
and eschews trying to sell anything until or unless the buyer knows exactly what 
they need and how they need to buy the first 9 steps of their Buying Journey. 
After all, you’ve got nothing to sell until they have something to buy. And all 
the information you share isn’t relevant until then.</li>
						<li>All buyers – even individuals buying a toothbrush, as well as complex sales go 
through some sort of internal change management before they’re set up to buy. 
It’s about the buying, not about the selling two different activities. Do you 
want to sell? or have someone buy? By putting on a 
consulting/coaching/facilitation hat, it’s possible to discover and enable real 
buyers quickly.</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>
BUYING FACILITATION® FACILITATES THE BUYER’S JOURNEY</h2>
						<p>
Here’s what we don’t know as sellers when we first reach out to buyers to 
understand need or find a prospect:<ol>
							<li>Where buyers are along their decision path.</li>
							<li>How many, or if, the requisite Buying Decision Team is in place, and ALL 
appropriate voices have been heard so a full evaluation of the upsides and 
downsides to change can be considered. </li>
							<li>Until ALL voices have been heard, there is no way to recognize or define 
‘need.’</li>
							<li>Who is a real buyer: only those who know how to manage change, and get 
consensus that they cannot fix the problem internally are buyers. Need doesn’t 
determine ability to buy.</li>
							<li>The fallout of the risk factors, and the ability for any group to withstand 
change.</li>
							<li>The types of change management issues that a new solution would entail.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>
The sales model does a great job placing solutions, but expends too much energy 
seeking those few who have completed their completed Buyer’s Journey and are at 
the point of being ready/able to buy. Sales believes a prospect is someone who 
SHOULD buy; Buying Facilitation® believes a prospect is someone who CAN buy and 
has the tools to invest in efficiently facilitating the Buyer’s Journey from the 
first moment of the first call, and THEN selling. to those who are indeed 
buyers. <p>
For less time and resource, we can actually lead buyers down their own change 
route and recognize who will, or won’t, be a buyer. In one conversation we can 
help them discern who they need to include on their Buying Decision Team; if we 
wish an appointment, the entire Decision Team will be eagerly awaiting us. On 
the first call we can find buyers at different stages along their journey who 
need our solutions but aren’t yet ready to buy. We just can’t use the sales 
model until after it&#39;s established who is actually a buyer.<p>
The differentiating factor is that we start out not trying to sell, or qualify, 
or determine needs (You’re now only closing less than 5%, so obviously that 
approach isn’t so successful.) but as Change Facilitators, with the goal to help 
Buyers manage their OWN Buying Decision Path; we trust that our buyers have 
their own answers, and our solutions may be a part of their solution. We’re 
outsiders; we can never know the intricate politics and history of a buyer’s 
environment.<p>
Let’s enter earlier with a change consultant hat on, to actually facilitate 
buyers to the point where they could be ready to buy – and THEN sell. We will 
find 8x more prospects, immediately recognize those who can never buy, and be 
true Servant Leaders. Otherwise we’re merely wasting over 95% of our time and 
resource seeking the low hanging fruit, and missing a vital opportunity to find, 
and close, those who WILL buy.And more will buy, and quicker.<p>
I know that some of the recognized sales models (Challenger) talk about 
‘buying’. But they are using ‘buyer-based’ terms in service to placing 
solutions, of finding ways to influence, persuade, or manipulate buying. But 
buyers don’t buy that way. They first need to navigate through their entire 
Buyer’s Journey. Help them. Then sell.<p>
