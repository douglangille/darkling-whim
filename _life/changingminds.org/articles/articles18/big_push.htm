The Big Push: why sellers, doctors, coaches, and leaders, don’t affect permanent change</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>How many times have you tried to sell an idea to a colleague, only to have it 
be misunderstood or ignored? Or offered important knowledge in a marketing piece 
or sales pitch meant to encourage or educate a prospect to buy, only to have it 
overlooked? Why don’t patients follow new healthcare regimens prescribed by 
doctors they trust, to heal an illness they know they have?<p>
I began thinking about this recently when I heard a noted leader in healthcare 
say: &quot;There is a persistent consensus that insufficient evidence exists that 
behavior can be modified.&quot; Hmmm. And yet the industry is throwing hundreds of 
millions of dollars researching Behavior Modification (without a parallel model 
to test it against! So much for the scientific method.). This is similar to my 
own aphorism, after decades of facilitating prospect buy-in in the sales 
industry: “Selling doesn’t cause buying.” Both recognize that the outside-in 
push method for causing compliance isn’t an effective way to elicit permanent 
change. Indeed: as outsiders, we’re trying to cause behavior change, rather than 
elicit it.<h2>
WHO’S INSANE?</h2>
<p>
The common thread behind both is the enduring belief (even with a 5% success 
rate in sales, and a only fraction of patients complying with necessary 
health-based regimens) that with the ‘right’ idea and the ‘best’ data, offered 
by someone who is ‘trustworthy’ and ‘credible’, written, offered, or spoken in a 
way that ‘inspires’ action, that people will act as they ‘should’ and make the 
‘right’ choices we’re ‘certain’ they need to make. <p>
But they’re not. And instead of recognizing that maybe we’ve got it wrong, that 
maybe we’re looking at the problem from the wrong angle while doing the same 
thing over and over hoping to get the results we want, we’re calling THEM 
irrational?? Seems to me we’re the very definition of insanity.<p>
Is it any wonder people aren’t compliant? Pushing OUR ideas, OUR beliefs, OUR 
biases, OUR assumptions, onto another, in the format WE&#39;VE chosen, assuming 
because we’re right, or smarter, or caring, or ‘scientific’ or or or, that 
they’ll do what WE want them to do! And then we’re surprised at the paucity of 
compliance?<p>
We know this doesn’t work. For decades, if not centuries, sellers, coaches, 
leaders, and now healthcare providers, have bemoaned the lack of success we’ve 
achieved (even building failure into our expected results) with our push 
methods. And yet we continue, hoping that we’ll say it right this time, or offer 
impeccable research data, or use terrific apps, or pitches, or marketing that 
will instigate permanent change or decisions in our favor. Has it never occurred 
that just maybe outside-in push doesn’t work? Or is it just that we don’t know 
what else to do?<h2>
THE FAILURE OF PUSH</h2>
<p>
Selling doesn’t cause buying. Good content creation doesn’t cause action. 
Behavior Modification doesn’t cause behavior change. Do you see a pattern here? 
As reflected in our failed attempts across industries and time, an external push 
– regardless of how trustworthy, or researched, or ‘rational’, or necessary as 
it may be – cannot cause another person to change permanently. <p>
As outsiders, we forget: change is an inside job. Yet our activity – all sales 
models and healthcare apps, coaching models and leadership trends – focuses on 
attempting to cause change from the outside. With our reports and regimens, 
proof and advice, stories and examples, we try to convince others to change 
before teaching them how to, and then complaining they’re not listening to us. 
Let me offer the reasons it’s not possible for people to change merely because 
we offer them terrific reasons why they should.<ol>
	<li><b>Subjective Listening</b>: This is the main hurdle with information push: people 
don’t hear the intent of a message, when it falls outside of their conditioned, 
subjective listening filters and habituated neural pathways, regardless of the 
efficacy of the information offered. When our clients, or children, or patients, 
&#39;mis-hear&#39; us, it&#39;s not their fault; their brains actually tell them something 
different from what was intended. </li>
	</ol>
	<blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<p>We all listen unconsciously, through our biases, assumptions, triggers, habits, 
and normalized neural pathways. I’ve written a book about the gap between what’s 
said and what’s heard (What? Did you really say what I think I heard?) and it’s 
formidable: our brains ‘kindly’ keep us comfortable and safe by hearing what 
they want, discarding bits of meaning and intent at will, without letting us 
know that what we end up ‘hearing’ is highly subjective and some unknowable 
percentage removed from what the speaker (or article, or app) intended. Try as 
we might – the best wording, or clever text/apps – whatever we say will be 
interpreted uniquely and not necessarily as we wish it to be interpreted; we’ll 
be heard more accurately only by those who already think exactly as we do. 
			<p>So: information-in will probably not be heard as intended and translated 
according to some unconscious filtering that we outsiders cannot control. And 
this is compounded by our assumption that because we believe we’ve said 
something clearly it should be understood, i.e. ‘they’re not listening’. They 
are. To the very best of their unconscious ability. And it&#39;s a good reason to 
not rely on sharing information as the way to influence change. 
		</blockquote>
	</blockquote>
	<ol>
		<li value="2"><b>Status Quo</b>: Every day we wake up being who we were yesterday. We live our 
lives and make decisions according to our unique Identity, our personal system 
of rules, experience, hopes, goals, culture, education, etc. developed over a 
lifetime, that cause us to operate in the world uniquely. This is how we wake up 
knowing how to brush our teeth and drive our cars, vote the way we prefer, and 
love who makes us happy – all regardless of the way others would like us to be.</li>
		</ol>
		<blockquote>
			<p>When any change is required of us our entire habituated, unconscious 
system/status quo faces disruption: to be willing and able to change, we must 
find a way for our personal system to buy-in to the new, get rid of the old, and 
find a way to maintain the habits and beliefs that keep us stable. Indeed, when 
we ask someone to change, regardless of the need, benefits, or the efficacy of 
the solution, we are asking people to unravel their status quo and do something 
different before they know if change would threaten who they know themselves to 
be. Their system, their status quo, is sacrosanct, and we are asking them to 
risk who they are.</blockquote>
		<p></p>
		<ol>
			<li value="3"><b>Trust</b>: When we assume we have answers for another, we are basically 
telling them we know more than they do, that we’re ‘right’ and they’re wrong, 
that we don’t trust them to find their own best route to excellence. So with the 
best will in the world, we push against their personal, habituated, normalized 
system (and yes, it’s the same system that caused the problem in the first 
place), and get… wait for it… resistance. And then we call them ‘stupid buyers’ 
or ‘non-compliant patients’. By not trusting our clients, by not enabling them 
to traverse their OWN route to congruent change, by assuming we have their 
answers and working at getting them to comply, we’re causing the very resistance 
we blame them for.</li>
			<li><b>Beliefs</b>: For some reason, outsiders attempt to change someone’s behaviors 
without realizing that behaviors are merely the transactions of our beliefs. 
It’s like trying to get an app to do something it’s not meant to do without 
changing the underlying programming. This is why Behavior Modification largely 
fails: it seeks to cause behavior change; only belief change, and systems 
buy-in, can elicit behavior change.</li>
			<li><b>Bias</b>: Even when accurately assessing another’s needs and have solutions 
that could resolve problems, our own needs for specific results bias our 
interactions. We’re outside the Other’s system, using our own preferred languaging, our own biased choices of stories and examples, our own approaches, 
posing biased questions meant to pull the data we want to understand (often 
regardless of how the Other uses or hears language i.e. biased) and assuming 
we’ll be heard and heeded! By choosing the words and story line we adhere to, by 
choosing activities or making requests according to our own need to get our 
suggestions recognized, we’re unintentionally biasing our interactions and 
restricting success to those who think, act, assume like we do.</li>
			</ol>
<p>
</p>
<p>So with the best will in the world, with solutions that can actually save 
lives and fix problems, we’re inhibiting success. We must stop pushing the 
change WE want to have happen, and begin facilitating others through their own 
behavior change, from within. We must elicit change rather than attempt to cause 
change. We must trust that everyone has their own answers and lead them through, 
and design, their own route to discovery and change, within their own norms and 
identity, so they remain congruent.<h2>
ELICIT CHANGE</h2>
<p>
We’ve not been given the tools to facilitate permanent change, depending instead 
on many ways to push information/change in. Yet information – heard through 
subjective filters, chosen, offered and presented in formats designed by biased 
do-gooders - doesn’t teach someone HOW to change congruently, from the inside. 
Inside-out. Pushing data in merely causes resistance. Here are the skills 
necessary to facilitate others through permanent, congruent change from the 
inside.<ol>
	<li><b>The Steps of Change</b>: There is a specific set of sequential steps that human 
systems follow unconsciously en route to change, starting with enabling Others 
to rise above the weeds, into an Observer position, so they can get into an 
unbiased and disassociated state to begin dispassionately noticing, assembling 
and assessing the elements that caused the systemic problem to begin with. 
[Note: information-in, and push models, cause people to dig in and defend.] I’ve 
coded the steps of change that every human system – i.e. every person, group, 
etc. – must traverse sequentially to remain congruent through change. Change 
will not occur until a person recognizes </li>
	</ol>
			<blockquote>
				<ul>
					<li>all of the elements of how they got where they’re at and the systems that hold 
them in place;</li>
					<li>they know without a shadow of a doubt that they cannot fix the problem with 
their known resources; </li>
					<li>that any proposed change could be factored into the existing system without 
fallout – i.e. the status quo would buy-in to change and be willing to do 
something different because it recognizes it won’t be harmed.</li>
				</ul>
				<blockquote>
					<p>It’s possible to lead people down their own steps of change to make their 
unconscious beliefs conscious and enable them to consider if it’s time to 
change. No one, no one, from outside can ever, ever understand what’s going on 
in other’s personal system.</blockquote>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
</p>
		<ol>
			<li value="2"><b>The Direction of Change</b>: People think in habituated patterns; to find the 
elements that maintain their status quo they must go beyond their habituated 
thinking to seek out bits of their unconscious that aren’t necessarily obvious. 
How to do this? By being Neutral Navigators, Change Facilitators, that guide the 
brain to its own answers. I’ve been thinking about this problem since 1980, 
understanding that conventional questions are biased by the Asker, and responded 
to accordingly. Repeat: any time we ask a question of another, it’s biased by 
our own need to know and word choices, and will be heard with biased ears.</li>
			</ol>
			<p></p>

				<blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						<p>To overcome bias, to help people find their own answers, and knowing that 
conventional questions are biased by the Asker, I’ve developed Facilitative 
Questions that actually direct the brain sequentially, through its own givens, 
to discover best answers (often unconscious) and avoids the bias of influencers 
who net/net seek answers/pull information THEY think relevant. (Definition: 
Facilitative Question – a systemic, action-based, directive question, (not 
information-pull) that uses specific words, in a specific order, to lead people 
through sequential steps of discovery and buy-in without bias.) These questions 
can be used in surveys, questionnaires, and research to elicit &#39;good&#39; 
information, without bias. I know this is a bit outside of mainstream thinking, 
but I’ve been successfully teaching the formulation of these questions for 
decades, in sales with Buying Facilitation®, coaching, and leadership – any 
place congruent change is required. Sometimes new ideas are needed, right?</p>
					</blockquote>
			</blockquote>
			<ol>
				<li value="3"><b>The Who of Change</b>: By taking on the mantel of Change Agents, Facilitators, 
Influencers regardless of field (i.e. in apps, in sales, in coaching), we must 
begin by trusting Others to discover and design their own change, not attempt to 
cause change with wizzy content, Behavior Mod approaches, pricing ‘deals’ or any 
other outside-in push techniques. They don’t work – hence a 95% failure rate in 
sales, and patients regularly not completing regimens that would help them heal. 
Once people recognize how to change themselves in a way that’s congruent with 
their personal system, they will then need outsiders to supply relevant 
information. First facilitate change for Others; then supply necessary data 
according to THEIR needs.</li>
				<li><b>Testing for Change</b>: By only doing research on Behavior Mod or other 
behavior change approaches, we’re ignoring the real problem and not helping 
people make permanent change. Let’s begin doing research on Change Facilitation 
practices in side-by-side experiments with behavior change approaches. Then 
we’ll have real answers.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
</p>
<h2>SUMMARY</h2>
				<p>
For those who want to think about the inherent problems of pushing change from 
the outside, below I’ve summarized the baseline beliefs in this article so you 
can begin thinking of why an inside-out approach is the only way to elicit 
successful change (Note: I’ve designed a Change Facilitation approach to handle 
this; design your own, or call me to discuss.):<ol>
					<li>We can never have answers for others, regardless of their need or the 
efficacy of their solution. Think about how you can enable others to address 
their internal beliefs to come up with their own answers that will normalize and 
habituate a new, more beneficial, habit pattern.</li>
					<li>People (or groups, etc.) won’t change until they can go beyond their 
habituated patterns, recognize that their current unconscious system is flawed 
and they cannot resolve a problem themselves; bringing in a ‘foreign’ solution 
is initially avoided as it would disrupt the status quo. </li>
					<li>Systems (i.e. people’s status quo) won’t change if the cost of the change is 
higher than the fallout from continuing the problems in the status quo. The 
system must discover this itself; telling only gets resistance.</li>
					<li>If offered information or activities run counter to the existent beliefs and 
entrenched, normalized habits within the system, they will be resisted, 
regardless of efficacy.</li>
					<li>Information is unnecessary, not understood, ignored, not accepted, until or 
unless the system has recognized it’s ready, willing, and able to change and 
knows exactly what it needs to assist it - and can hear the intended message 
without bias or resistance. That’s why we have success only with the low hanging 
fruit – those who have already gone through their own internal change process. 
So information last, Change Facilitation first. By asking them biased questions 
based on our need for information, by offering them our regimens, pitches, 
stories, reasons, proof, etc., we restrict success to those who need that 
specific piece of information at that moment, and ignore those who may need to 
change but otherwise resist.</li>
					<li>There is a sequence of change that all systems go through unconsciously to 
open a place for congruent change that avoids resistance. It is not information 
based, but belief-change. Focus first on leading patients and prospects through 
discovery before offering data.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
It’s possible to develop healthcare apps that first enable Others to be ready 
for change prior to offering Behavior Mod. It’s possible for sellers to first 
facilitate prospect buy-in, notice those who WILL buy and are ready for change 
on the first call. It’s possible to facilitate coaching clients through 
permanent change. And I know that influencers like to be the pivot point, the 
arbiter of change. But if an outside-in line of questioning or directing is 
used, only people who have done their own change work first will be compliant. 
Let’s elicit change; let’s stop pushing.<p>
I’m happy to discuss the above with anyone, and seek situations to test, use, 
offer my stuff to enhance excellence. Sharondrew@sharondrewmorgen.com<p>
