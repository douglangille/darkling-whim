Write Content That Facilitates Buying Decisions</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Because of your sophisticated tracking and targeting, you know who’s reading 
your content. But do you know why they’re reading it? And how are you accessing 
those who could/should buy but are ignoring the articles your sending them? </p>
<p>Content is written with different reasons in mind: for Buyer Personas to 
learn about your solution as early along their decision path as possible; for 
brand recognition; to gain followers; to make a sale. We write with a narrow 
focus to reach our target market and use every means at our disposal to 
distribute and track it, hoping that it will help us make a sale or find more 
followers.<h2>
DATA VS DECISIONS</h2>
<p>
But how do you know if this content, with these ideas and these words, written 
in this style, will enable those seeking a new solution to recognize they need 
you? Not only are you seeking a reader you can’t fully know (Why are they 
reading the content? No. Really. Why? And how many possible buyers reject it 
because they’re not ready yet?), you’re hoping, guessing, tracking, targeting, 
and crossing your fingers in hopes it will get into the right hands at the right 
time to take action. <p>
But your glorious content – sometimes little more than a thinly veiled 
advertisement – may not be getting you all the success you deserve. You have a 
ceiling of a 5% success rate (less than 1% for content marketing) because you’re 
limiting your readership to those who have already decided on their next 
actions. By sticking to data push, you’re missing an opportunity to make your 
content an interactive experience that enable the act of decision making. With a 
few adjustments, you can create content that can be used to facilitate a sale 
and expand and enlist your audience.<p>
The problem starts with the use of content marketing as part of your 
sales/solution placement toolkit. Certainly content marketing is great for 
explaining, pitching, writing about, introducing, and presenting data about our 
solutions. But this usage limits our target audience to those who are ready to 
buy, and are also perusing competitive data. <p>
When you think about the early activity within the act of buying – the 
Pre-Sales, change management, decision issues that include 13 steps to 
consensus/action (9 of which are Pre-Sales and not ‘needs’ or ‘buying’ related) 
– there’s a huge swath of prospective buyers who aren’t reading your content as 
it is because they’re not ready, but could easily be made ready with content 
that fits into the route of their Pre-Sales change management decisions. You can 
develop different types of relevant content so you’re with them each step of the 
way, even before they’re aware they might need you.<p>
See, prior to deciding on a solution, buyers have some change work to do that’s 
systemic in nature and vital to them maintaining Systems Congruence – the rules, 
initiatives, relationships, and history of their culture and environment. They 
can’t just wake up one day, see your content, and drop everything and everyone 
mindlessly to do what you want them to do. No one buys like that.<p>
Thinking that a prospective buyer ‘needs’ your content, or will be convinced or 
influenced to take action before they’re ready, is magical thinking and 
needlessly restricts your audience. Obvious, no? Before anyone buys anything 
they do research, get input and alternate ideas from friends/colleagues, discern 
the potential fallout, trial different possibilities, and ultimately get 
agreement to move forward. You content is only relevant when they’ve handled all 
of this. By pushing your message, you’re restricting buying. You can use content 
marketing to facilitate the process.<h2>
CASE STUDY</h2>
<p>
When it was time to begin marketing my book What? Did you really say what I 
think I heard? I had a problem. Known for my Buying Facilitation® material in 
the sales industry, I had no obvious audience in communication or listening. I 
had to attract a new audience: find new readers AND shift from being a ‘sales’ 
expert to a ‘communication’ expert. My goal was to offer corporate teams a 
one-day Listening Without Bias training. To do that I needed readers to first 
buy my book. <p>
Realizing I’d need buy-in to run an in-house program, I wrote an article that 
would attract the largest population of readers because of the universal 
problems involved: meetings. I wrote a very helpful article on meetings that 
offered both a clear description of the inherent problems and offered very 
creative, tough, usable solutions to make them creative, collaborative, and 
results-oriented. I never mentioned anything to do with listening. There was no 
manipulation or commercial overlay in the article, no links to listening/book 
links appeared only in the footer.<p>
I got dozens of ‘Thank You’ notes from readers I’d never heard of, saying they’d 
sent/shared my article among hundreds of employees, friends, and colleagues. 
Many, many people shared the article on social media, bringing me new readers 
and subscribers outside my natural market. The article was ranked as one of my 
best-read articles, with thousands reading it the first few days. And my book 
sales went through the rood: I had a 51% conversion rate.<p>
So yes, content is vital. But it can be read by more prospective buyers, earlier 
in their decision path. Start by understanding each of the Pre-Sales issues 
(i.e. systemic changed-based, not ‘need’ based or solution-based) your buyers 
must address with their colleagues and partners, and then write articles that 
will help them along their normal route to making the internal decisions they’d 
need to make before they can buy. Then you’ll have proven your worth and be 
familiar to them. By the time they’re ready to buy and have all their internal 
ducks in a row, they’ll seek out your content.<p>
