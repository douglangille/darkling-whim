I Hear You My Way</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I recently got an email from a subscriber complaining that although he’d read 
and learned a ton from my articles over the years, he was having trouble reading 
them on his computer and would I please put them on my blog (They’re up front 
for two weeks after sending out.). <p>
When I read the email, I heard him telling me what to do and being disrespectful 
in several ways. My inner response: “Wait, what?! Why email me before checking? 
And if you loved my ideas why didn’t you want to learn them by purchasing the 
learning tools that go with them?? And why wouldn’t you try printing the 
articles before asking me to change for you? Why show up now to tell me what I 
do wrong when you’ve ignored thanking me for how long? And Dude: I don’t even 
know you!” <p>
I didn’t say all that, naturally. Instead I wrote suggesting he check my site, 
asked why he never wanted to learn the full skills sets that went with my 
articles, and suggested a printer might be a good solution to his reading 
problem. He replied by offering names of other bloggers that do it his way (He 
STILL didn’t check! He STILL tried to convince me he was right!); that he was 
merely trying to help (Help what? Who?) so why didn’t I appreciate his efforts 
(To do what?), and (the best one): why was I getting defensive when he was 
offering me valuable advice (According to who? Insulting!)? <p>
Two people hearing what they heard, entering a dialogue with unique 
expectations, subjective filters, and biases, and each some distance from the 
truth. <h2>
SUBJECTIVE FILTERS CAUSE A TRANSLATION PROBLEM</h2>
<p>
When a misunderstanding or misrepresentation occurs, Speakers assume they are in 
the ‘right’ because they ‘said it clearly’, and believe their communication 
partner is just ‘not listening’; Listeners assume what they think they hear is 
accurate. <p>
But both are wrong: Speakers erroneously think that because they choose what 
seem like the ‘right’ words to impart their message accurately, Listeners should 
understand exactly what they mean/intend. But it’s not possible, and it’s not a 
‘listening’ problem, or a problem of intent, skill, or concentration. It’s 
translation problem caused by the brain’s wiring. <p>
As Listeners we can certainly hear the words spoken. But when it comes to 
interpreting them, we’re at the mercy of how our subjective listening filters 
translate the words we hear. Indeed, we only grasp our own unconscious 
translation of what’s been said, regardless of how disparate it is from the 
message intended. My newest book (What? Did you really say what I think I 
heard?) breaks down how our subjective filters, normalized thinking patterns, 
and habituated neural pathways determine what we hear Others say. And as I 
learned while writing, it’s not our fault.<h2>
WE CANNOT INTERPRET ACCURATELY</h2>
<p>
The precursor to communication may begin with a Speaker wishing to share or 
gather ideas, feelings, thoughts, etc. They then translate these thoughts into 
spoken words they assume will accurately translate their ideas to Listeners. So 
Speakers translate abstract ideas or thoughts into spoken words: inside-out.<p>
Listeners have an almost opposite process. Words heard from Speakers enter 
Listener’s ears through vibrations, go from the ear and into the brain, get 
filtered through biases, assumptions, and triggers, then move along habituated 
neural pathways – subconscious filters, beliefs and historic givens that form 
our identity – to offer a unique interpretation that often supersedes the intent 
of the Speaker to some unknown degree. In other words, Listening is outside-in: 
brains code incoming messages uniquely and systemically and don’t necessarily 
end up ‘hearing’ or translating the message the Speaker meant to impart. We 
don’t intend to mishear or misunderstand; we just can’t do it otherwise.<p>
Let me explain a bit more. Using conventional listening practices (i.e. normal 
content-based listening) it’s not possible to go beyond our brain’s normalized 
translation routes. There are hundreds of types of bias, assumptions, filters, 
triggers, habits, and neural pathways that keep us congruent by making sure what 
we hear perpetuates our lifelong conditioning. Even if we try hard to hear the 
exact words spoken (if we write down each word as it’s spoken – we remember 
words spoken for about 3 seconds), knowing the words does NOT denote accuracy: 
our brains interpret incoming words idiosyncratically regardless of the 
meaning/intent behind the spoken words.<p>
The story gets worse. Not only do we unwittingly interpret what’s been said 
according to our own beliefs and biases, we have no idea of the reality: we 
might hear ABL when the Speaker actually said/meant ABC and we have no way of 
knowing that our brains deleted D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K as they pare down matches 
between memory channels and incoming messages, discarding elements of ideas, 
meaning, etc. in its search for compatibility. We then, still unconsciously, 
assign a unique meaning to whatever remains according to compatibility (or 
incompatibility) and connections with our existing beliefs and history of 
similar ideas. <p>
So we think we hear what whatever our brains tell us and we have no way of 
knowing what’s been altered, omitted, or misappropriated, and assume what we 
think we hear is accurate. We always get some percentage wrong, but it’s not our 
fault. <h2>
WHO GETS HURT</h2>
<p>
Here are some of the areas particularly affected by the way our brains translate 
what they hear:<p>
<b>Questions to gather information</b>: when Speakers seek answers to achieve goals or 
gather data (i.e. sellers, doctors, coaches, influencers, parents, etc.) they 
can’t help but pose biased questions according to their need to know, and 
sometimes restrict the full landscape of possibility to a confined data set. So 
Listeners end up potentially offering ‘bad’ or incomplete data that is mistaken 
for Truth. It’s not bad data, exactly: Listeners brains get triggered to memory 
channels according to the biases inherent in the questions, offering Speakers 
some unknown/unknowable portion of reality. <p>
Compounded with the natural unconscious translation process Listeners incur, 
most exchanges suffer some degree of restriction due to the biases in a 
Speaker’s questions. [Note: I’ve invented Facilitative Questions that are 
systemic, unbiased, directional, and cause a Listener’s brain to 1. disassociate 
from normalized thinking and 2. seek a very specific route to finding and 
extracting the appropriate data outside habituated neural pathways. As a result, 
Listeners actually discover and share more accurate answers.]<p>
<b>Influencer conversations</b>: doctors, consultants, coaches, leaders, etc. offer 
advice, stories, requests, information, etc. as persuasion tactics, trying to 
use ‘rational reasoning’, Behavior Modification, intuition/stories/scientific 
arguments, etc. to cause, rather than elicit, Other’s congruent change and 
instead end up threatening their status quo. When ideas are pushed without first 
enlisting belief change to accept the new concept, the status quo resists: 
influencers create thier own resistance.<p>
Change requests from professionals: unfortunately, as you can see above, we 
often cause the resistance we get to important change requests. Remember: people 
can only hear what their brains allow them to hear and incoming messages will be 
uniquely translated regardless of how important, or life-saving, the 
information. It’s not their fault. Blame their brains and their lifelong 
filters. And don’t forget to blame the professionals who continue to push change 
because ‘it’s right’ without enabling collaborative dialogues to ensure 
understanding and congruent change practices.<p>
<b>The bottom line is</b>: so long as we’re using information sharing or gathering as 
the route to enabling change into a brain that&#39;s set up to maintain the status 
quo, we’re at the mercy of Another’s subjective filters, habituated neural 
pathways, and normalized status quo. For those wishing to learn an alternate 
approach, I’ve developed a Change Facilitation model (Buying Facilitation®) I’ve 
been training globally for 35 years, for sellers, coaches, and doctors, to 
enable congruent change in Others.<p>
Situations of great import to Speaker: regardless of the importance of the 
message - i.e. a doctor imploring a patient to stop smoking, or a parent 
discussing the danger of drugs to teenagers, for example – patients hear, 
translate, mishear uniquely, and too often end up with a different take-away 
than doctors intend; partners end up annoyed for no reason; buyers end up 
feeling manipulated and pushed. <p>
I often tell a story of an unfortunate conversation I had with a new business 
partner and his wife: John suddenly got angry, shouting at me about something I 
never said. ‘I never said that,’ said I. ‘Of course you did! I heard it with my 
own ears! I was standing right here!’ ‘She never said that, John. I was sitting 
right here also. She’s right. She never said that.’ ‘What’s wrong with you 
two!!!! You’re both lying to me!’ and he stomped out of the room, ending our 
partnership.<p>
Net net: unless the criteria, the mindset, the outcomes, the definitions, and 
the challenges have been agreed to prior to the beginning of a conversations and 
the definitions, outcomes, and goals are agreed to by all communication 
partners, the odds are bad that Others can hear the intended message accurately. 
Obviously, this restricts the range of possible outcomes. <h2>
HOW YOU CAN BE HEARD</h2>
<p>
So:<ol>
	<li>No matter how ‘carefully’ Others listen, there’s some chance they cannot hear 
the message we send. The farther the communication partners are away from the 
life experience of the Other, the more misinterpretation occurs.</li>
	<li>Active Listening is built around Listeners noting the exact words spoken and 
then interpreting them ‘correctly’. It’s impossible – impossible – for anyone 
outside the Other’s brain (including Group Brain) to fully, accurately interpret 
what Another means (Others interpret according to their OWN subjective filters 
regardless of the words spoken): much easier if it’s a family member with a 
continuing intimate involvement; much more difficult if lives are disparate, 
with a different community, industry, lifestyle or family history, with 
different needs and assumptions. In other words, when Active Listeners think 
they understand the Other’s intended message as per words spoken, they’re most 
likely guessing. The bigger problem occurs when they assume they’re right.</li>
	<li>In a conversation we automatically assume what we think we’ve heard is an 
accurate representation. Unfortunately, there’s no internal mechanism to 
automatically figure out the distance between accurate and ‘wrong’. </li>
	</ol>
	<p>
In What? I have chapters that tell Speakers how to notice when the responses 
they get seem to be faulty, and teach Listeners how to go ‘beyond the brain’ and 
listen from a ‘dissociative’ place (In Observer, or on the ceiling. I devote 
Chapter 6 in What? to dissociative listening.) that avoids the normalized and 
habituated neural pathways, but is certainly different from conventional 
listening. <p>
Since many professionals believe they hear just fine (It’s the Other’s fault for 
mishearing!) I’d like to help you determine if you’re ready to learn additional 
tools to help you accurately hear what’s intended. Here are a few Facilitative 
Questions to help you decide (And note how they help you dissociate and 
recognize a broader viewpoint, possibly beyond resistance.):<ol>
		<li>What would you need to believe differently to consider that Others’ 
‘mishearing’ or ‘misunderstanding’ is a function of their subjective filters and 
that they’re not NOT paying attention or stubbornly ignoring you?</li>
		<li>How would you know if it were time to add some new skills to how you’re 
listening, to offer more options to expand the scope of what you hear?</li>
		<li>As an influencer, how will you recognize those times your ‘intuition’ may be 
faulty and that indeed you have mistranslated what you heard?</li>
		<li>How will you know when/if the questions you pose bias the data you collect 
and you’re leaving important facts undiscovered?</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
I know that many of you believe you hear accurately and act accordingly, and any 
inconsistency is the fault of the Other. But there’s a high probability that 
neither you nor your communication partner are hearing each other accurately. 
It’s no one’s fault. But you can do something about it by dissociating, going 
beyond your brain, assuming you are unwittingly missing something. For those who 
don’t want to learn the path to dissociative listening, at least take an 
additional step in your conversations, assume both you and your communication 
partner may not be hearing each other accurately, and ask:<p>
Ask yourself: would you rather think you’re right, or hear accurately? What’s 
the cost if you don’t?<p>
