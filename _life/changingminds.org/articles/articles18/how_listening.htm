How Listening Filters Cause Misunderstanding</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
When researching my book on closing the gap between what’s said and what’s 
heard, I was surprised to learn how little of what we hear someone say is 
unbiased, or even accurate. Seems we hear what we want to hear, and not 
necessarily what’s been meant; too often we don’t know the difference. There are 
several elements that conspire against accuracy. And sadly, it’s largely out of 
our control.<h2>
THE PROBLEM WITH LANGUAGE</h2>
<p>
Let me begin with my definitions of ‘language’ and ‘communication’: <p>
In dialogue, language is a translation process between a Speaker’s thoughts - 
translated and verbalized into a delivery system of ideas, words, voice (tone, 
tempo, pitch), and the unspoken goal/bias of the outcome sought - and the 
Listener’s filtering system. <p>
A completed communication is a circle - Speaker -&gt; Listener -&gt; Speaker: the 
Speaker translates an internal thought/idea through language to their 
Communication Partner (CP) who listens through their own unique and subjective 
filters, and responds to what they have interpreted. Until or unless the 
Speaker’s message has been received accurately, the communication is not 
complete. <p>
Language itself is one of the problems we face when attempting to accurately 
understand what a Speaker means:<ul>
	<li>We speak in one unbroken stream of words (Spaces appear only between written 
words.) that can be differentiated only by those familiar with the language and 
vocabulary (Have you ever asked a question from a language book in a foreign 
country and get a response in a continuous stream of sounds that can’t be 
isolated to allow you to look up words to translate?) Since everyone speaks in 
word streams, our ears have become subjectively habituated to listen for 
patterns within them; our brains continue down those pathways even if the 
Speaker’s intent isn’t matched. </li>
	<li>Words have uniquely nuanced meanings for each of us. The words a Speaker 
chooses that impart understanding may not be the best word choices for our 
Listener whose subjective filtering process may not match, or indeed instigate 
the wrong interpretation.</li>
	<li>Our brains only remember spoken words for approximately 3 seconds. By the time 
our brains separate the individual words to glean meaning, we’re lagging 
‘behind’ the speaker, so we rely on our unconscious habits and thinking patterns 
to bridge, or fill in, gaps in understanding. Obviously, it’s easiest to 
accurately understand people we’re similar to.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
Arguably the largest detractor of accuracy for understanding our CPs intended 
message are the cultural, experiential, belief, education, and intimacy gaps 
that create subjective and unconscious filters in us all. These filters - 
biases, assumptions, triggers, habituated neural pathways, and memory channels - 
unconsciously and automatically sift out or transform what our CP says that’s 
uncomfortable or different from our beliefs, our lifestyles, etc., or aren’t in 
line within the goal of what we’re actively seeking in the exchange.<p>
While we each assume that what we ‘hear’ is an accurate representation of what’s 
been said, often it’s not. With our subjective listening filters uniquely 
interpreting what others say, we can’t help but<ul>
		<li>bias their intended message subjectively, </li>
		<li>make inaccurate assumptions, miss important ideas, requests, and emotional 
cues,</li>
		<li>follow established memory channels and neural pathways that lead us to wrongly 
interpret what was meant, </li>
		<li>mishear directions, rules, warnings, nuance, names etc., </li>
		<li>take away mistaken comprehension, </li>
		</ul>
		<p>
and on and on. As sellers we ‘hear’ that people are buyers; as coaches we ‘hear’ 
people complain of stuff we know how to fix; as leaders we ‘hear’ our teams 
convey they’re on-board (or not) with our ideas; as change agents we ‘hear’ 
rejection rather than alternate approaches or shared concerns; as parents we 
‘hear’ our teenagers making excuses. <h2>
OUR BRAINS TRICK US</h2>
		<p>
Simplistically, here’s our unconscious listening process: 
		<ol>
			<li>We first listen through a hierarchy of historic and habitual filters, 
unconsciously seeking a match with our biases, beliefs, and values – and delete 
or alter what seems incompatible. </li>
			<li>With what’s left from the initial round of filtering, our brains seek a match 
with something familiar by sorting for a similar memory, which could focus on 
just a term or one of the ideas mentioned, or or or, and throws away what 
doesn’t match without telling us what’s been omitted or misconstrued! We might 
accurately hear the words spoken, but unconsciously assign a vastly different 
interpretation from the intended meaning.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
And because we’re only ‘told’ what our brains ‘tell’ us has been said, we end up 
‘certain’ that what we think we hear is actually what’s meant. So if someone 
says ABC we might actually hear ABL, without knowing what our brains added, 
subtracted, or muddled. I once lost a business partner because he ‘heard’ me say 
X when three of us sitting there, including his wife, confirmed I said Y. “I was 
right here! Why are you all lying to me! I heard it with my own ears!” And he 
walked out in a self-generated rage. His brain actually told him I said 
something I never said and he never questioned it, even though three people told 
him he misheard.<p>
I know this is disconcerting but it’s important to understand: Listeners always 
assume what they (think they) hear is what has been said. And where this 
diverges from the Speaker’s intended meaning, we end up responding to an 
inaccurate understanding, blaming our CP for miscommunicating, and never 
consider that just maybe we unwittingly got it wrong. <p>
It all happens automatically and unconsciously, and we end up involuntarily 
misunderstanding without realizing, until too late, that there is a problem. 
Indeed we have no conscious ability to tell our brains what to search for when 
we’re listening, causing us to potentially hear a fraction of a fraction of 
what’s meant; we then compound the problem by responding according to what we 
THINK has been said. So we might get self-righteously angry, or perceive we’re 
forgiven; we hear people as racists or healers or sarcastic or buyers; we feel 
slighted or complimented or ignored; we think ideas are stupid and opinions 
absurd. And in each instance, we miss the possibility of a partnership, or a new 
concept, or a conversation or relationship that might have been.<p>
In summary: the structure of language itself causes confusion when listening to 
Others; our subjective filters - biases (of which there are hundreds), 
assumptions, and triggers - are unconscious impediments to what we think we 
hear; our neural pathways, habitual associations, and memory channels 
automatically, and subjectively, get triggered by a word or phrase and go down 
their own well-traveled path to seek a match, potentially eschewing more 
relevant or accurate routes to understanding; our brains don’t tell us what it’s 
omitted or transformed, leaving us potentially misunderstanding – without 
question - what our CP meant to impart. <p>
And it’s all unconscious. According to Sarah Williams Goldhagen in Welcome to 
Your World, our unconscious (or ‘nonconscious’ as she calls it) is approximately 
90% of our attention, and only 10% “…patterned and schematized in a way we can 
interact with others.”(pg 59) So misunderstanding is virtually built into our 
communication.<h2>
LISTENING FOR METAMESSAGES INSTEAD OF WORDS</h2>
			<p>
Unfortunately we have no automatic capability to hear a Speaker’s intended 
message accurately, regardless of the Speaker’s word choices or the Listener’s 
commitment to listening ‘carefully’, regardless of the costly wordsmithing done 
in many industries to lure Listener buy-in. But as Listeners can take an active 
role in consciously managing our listening filters to encourage greater 
understanding. For this we must circumvent our biased listening; we must learn 
the skill of avoiding listening for meaning solely from the words.<p>
From birth, we’re taught to carefully listen for words (and Active Listening has 
a part to play in this predisposition), assuming, falsely, we’ll translate them 
accurately. We can, however, circumvent our normal filtering process by shifting 
our attention from listening to words to listening for meaning; listening for 
what’s meant, rather than for what’s said; listening less to the words and more 
for the Speaker’s underlying intent. <p>
Let’s walk this back. Remember that Speakers speak to impart an underlying 
thought (I call this the Metamessage) and then unconsciously select the most 
precise words – for that situation, for that Listener - to do so. But these word 
choices might not be the best ones to garner accurate understanding in that 
particular Listener. Certainly, a Speaker has no idea how a Listener’s filters 
will interpret the sent message. This becomes more obvious when speaking to a 
group and some members understand, others misunderstand. To circumvent 
misunderstanding, to have a greater chance of hearing what’s meant and 
eliminating the factors causing misunderstanding, we must take filters out of 
the listening process. <p>
There’s a higher probability of hearing others accurately if Listeners bypass 
the normal filtering process and instead focus on the Speaker’s intended 
meaning. I learned the basic concept while studying NLP (NeuroLinguistic 
Programming – the study of the structure of subjective experience) and expanded 
it in my book What? Did you really say what I think I heard? When listening we 
can actually go beyond the brain and experience a broad view (not intimate 
details) of what’s being meant. <p>
To avoid our listening filters, to get the broader meaning behind the idea 
intended, we must go ‘up to the ceiling’ and listen as a Witness/Observer. A 
very simple example would be if someone said ‘I wish you would be on time more 
often’, the Metamessage might be ‘I hate that you’re late again. And I’m getting 
tired of waiting for you all the time!’ We do this naturally when speaking with 
a small child, listening with for what they mean to tell us, rather than focus 
on their possibly unskilled wordsmithing. Or when we overhear a conversation in 
a Starbucks. In both instances we’re Observers. <p>
We don&#39;t know how to consciously choose; the problem is we don’t know how to 
consciously choose to do so. To choose the Witness/Observer viewpoint, think of 
a time when you’re aware you were listening without any personal agenda and 
break down how you did that – how you knew when it was time to disengage from 
the words, what you noticed that was different, how it shifted your 
communication exchange. If it’s something you want to learn, I’ve written an 
entire chapter on this (Chapter 6) in What?.<h2>
LISTENING FOR MEANING VS WORDS</h2>
			<p>
Here are two cold call interactions that exemplify the difference between 
listening for words vs for Metamessages. The first is a dialogue of a coaching 
client in which I was teaching him how to sell with integrity. He started out 
fine, but then dissolved into his old push technique when he interpreted the 
prospect’s words according to his own filters:<p class="quote">
BROKER: Hi My name is Jeff Rosen. I sell insurance and this is a cold call. Is 
this a good time to speak?<p class="quote">
CLIENT: Hi Jeff. Thanks for calling but I’m just walking out the door.<p class="quote">
BROKER: “IonlyneedtwosecondsIwouldliketocomeandseeyounextweek.”<p class="quote">
The prospect hung up.<p class="quote">
SDM: What was that????? You started off great! And he responded kindly.<p class="quote">
BROKER: I had to talk really fast because he said he was busy.<p>
Listening for the spoken words through his filters, my client only heard a time 
constraint and didn’t ‘hear’ that the prospect stayed on the line and didn’t 
hang up. Listening from a Witness/Observer position he would have heard that the 
prospect was polite and hanging in with him, and made another choice: “I’ll call 
back when it’s convenient.” Or “Thanks. What’s a better time?” <p>
In a very similar situation, I made a cold call to the Chief Training Officer at 
IBM; you’ll notice that both of us listened for the Metamessage instead of the 
words:<p class="quote">
NANCY: [The world’s fastest] HELLO!<p class="quote">
SDM: You sound busy. When should I call back?<p class="quote">
NANCY: Tomorrow at 2. <p class="quote">
And we both hung up.<p class="quote">
This continued for 3 days with the exact same dialogue. Finally we had this 
exchange on day 4:<p class="quote">
NANCY: HELLO!<p class="quote">
SDM: You still sound busy.<p class="quote">
NANCY: Who are you? <p class="quote">
SDM: Sharon Drew Morgen, and this is only a cold call. I can call you back when 
you&#39;re not so busy.<p class="quote">
NANCY: What are you selling?<p class="quote">
SDM: Training for a facilitated buying model to use with sales.<p class="quote">
NANCY: I’ll give you 5 minutes.<p class="quote">
SDM: Not enough.<p class="quote">
NANCY: 10 minutes.<p class="quote">
SDM: Not enough.<p class="quote">
NANCY: OK. I’m yours. But I want to know how you just did what you did. How did 
you get me to speak with you? How do I feel so respected when you’re cold 
calling me? How did you get me to give you so much time? And can you teach my 
sales team how to do that? Can you come next month? [Note: I ended up training 
with them for two years. I didn’t even have to pitch.]<p>
Both of us listened with our Witness hats on. Nancy heard my Metamessage: by 
immediately hanging up after getting a time, she ‘heard’ me say that I respected 
her time. Calling back at the requested time told her I was responsible. Telling 
her it was a sales cold told her I was honest and wasn’t going to manipulate 
her. And by me abiding to her time frame she abided to mine. Indeed, I ‘said’ 
none of those things in words; the meaning was the message I intended to send. 
My goal was to connect if possible and serve if able. To connect, I’d have to 
value her time, not push; to serve I’d be honest and responsible. So she ‘heard’ 
me, beyond the words. It was win/win.<p>
So here’s a suggestion: For those times it’s important to understand the 
underlying meaning of another’s communication, and you cannot risk biases and 
assumptions that might significantly alter the outcome, I suggest you go up to 
the ‘ceiling’ and listen from Witness/Observer. <p>
This is a great tool for those of you who are Active Listening proponents. When 
listening to correctly capture the words spoken, understand your brain will bias 
how you interpret them and you may not achieve clarity as to the intent of the 
message. In my experience, AL doesn’t ensure understanding and too often puts 
the ‘blame’ of misunderstanding on the Speaker. <p>
Try listening from the ‘ceiling’ from Witness/Observer. It might make a 
difference. And if that’s not comfortable at least clear a way to understanding 
in each important conversation: <p>
Before we continue, I just want to make sure I understand what you mean to say.<p>
Here’s what I heard…. Is that accurate? <p>
Communication is delicate, as are relationships. Take the time to ensure you and 
your Communication Partner are on the same page. And delight that a shared 
understanding inspires possibility.<p>
