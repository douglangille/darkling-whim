How To Help Buyers Shift Their Status Quo</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I’ve recently heard sales folks complain that the status quo was the ‘enemy’ of 
buyers buying. Nonsense. It&#39;s just another element along the buyer&#39;s decision 
path that must be addressed, and can be directed, codified, and influenced – but 
not with a sales hat on. Let’s consider the, um, status quo: When does a buyer 
buy? When they’re ready - regardless of their need. When is a buyer ready? When 
their stable status quo recognizes it cannot fix any problems with known 
resources and is prepared to change in a way that won’t cause irreparable 
disruption. A buying decision (any decision, frankly) is a change management 
problem. Here are the basics: <p>
<b>Ready</b>: Ready means that 
<ul>
	<li>the status quo has carefully determined (through trial, error, and agreement) 
that it cannot fix recognized problems with anything familiar (current vendors, 
current software, other departments, different people),</li>
	<li>there has been systemic buy-in and the status quo is ready, willing, able to 
incorporate something new into the current operating procedures, </li>
	<li>a new solution can fit without major disruption (or it will be rejected 
regardless of the need or the efficacy of the new),</li>
	<li>the ‘new’ matches the rules, values- and systems-based criteria that 
identifies it. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
In other words, even if buyers need your solution, they can’t buy if the cost of 
disruption is higher than the cost of the solution implementation. And here is 
the frustrating part for us: Any change must be initiated, managed, and 
maintained from within the system because no outsider can understand the nuances 
of a status quo they are not part of. Here is a rule: until they know how to 
manage any change that would be incurred as a result of a purchase, prospective 
buyers cannot buy regardless of need. <p>
<b>Status quo</b>: The status quo is 
	<ul>
		<li>the established conglomeration of elements that define our unique, largely 
unconscious, human operating system, </li>
		<li>made up of idiosyncratic rules that determine the habits, patterns, agreeable behaviors, and organizing principles that enable us to get up every day as the 
same person/team we were yesterday, </li>
		<li>a representation of the beliefs, values, history, assumptions, moral 
structure, cultural/educational standards it embodies, </li>
		<li>stable, unique, idiosyncratic, complex, and mysterious (especially to 
outsiders). </li>
		</ul>
		<p>
The status quo keeps us operating congruently every moment of every day. It 
doesn’t judge right or wrong; it doesn’t recognize good or bad. It’s just ‘what 
is’. To become a different ‘what is’ it would have to change. And change means 
disruption, potentially a breakdown or interruption of normal operating. 
Although a natural occurrence – we move house, make new friends, take a new 
jobs, buy new clothes - we won’t substantially change unless we are assured we 
avoid disruption, confusion, and uncertainty.<h2>
THE PROBLEM WITH CHANGING THE STATUS QUO</h2>
		<p>
The norms and values within a status quo have been normalized; right or wrong, 
good or bad, we function in a pre-ordained way day after day. Anything – 
anything – threatening this habitual functioning will be resisted. I remember 
sitting on the floor of a hut in the Ecuadorian Amazon, sharing a meal with an 
indigenous family. My women travel friends were warned not to smile at the local 
boys who showed up to stare, as a smile was an invite to bed. After imbibing 
liberally on the local and highly fermented ‘chi cha’, everyone was drunkenly 
smiling – a cultural imperative for Americans – and the boys surrounded us like 
bees in a flower garden. Our host had to usher the swarming, eager boys out, 
offering a frustrated glare at us en route. The rules of our cultural status quo 
included being friendly to strangers; the rules of their status quo included 
avoiding women unless invited. <p>
As individuals, our status quo has been formed by our subjective life 
experiences: the rules, beliefs, and thinking that we learn from our parents and 
grandparents, our schooling and birthplace, our education and work life, our 
friends and family. Our life choices, our communication patterns, our choice of 
mates and jobs all maintain our status quo. Doing anything different threatens 
our very core. <p>
As members of teams, groups, or relationships, our status quo has more moving 
parts, including individual needs, rules for collaboration and communication, 
politics, corporate regs, and the historic relationships. For our clients, it&#39;s 
imperative they maintain their status quo or they cannot get up day after day 
and run a business.<p>
At the point we meet clients they are a walking bouquet of normalized elements 
that make no sense to anyone outside the group (or even inside the group 
sometimes). When we try to push change, the offered information is seen as 
foreign and will be resisted regardless of its efficacy. Until or unless the 
status quo knows how to add something new in a way that conforms to its baseline 
(and unconscious) rules, and understands that no permanent damage will occur, it 
won’t be willing/able to shift behaviors, learn new habits/patterns, or accept 
new ideas or solutions. In other words, no change can happen. <h2>
SALES, BUY-IN, CHANGE, AND THE STATUS QUO</h2>
		<p>
Changing the status quo is a challenge of Systems Congruence; the new must fit 
comfortably with the habitual so the person or team can continue functioning 
normally.<p>
For buyers, the time it takes them to figure out how to do this is the length of 
the sales cycle. It’s a systems/change thing, not a purchase/fix thing. But 
facilitating congruent change hasn’t been part of the sales skill set: with our 
solution-placement agenda, we limit our prospect population by seeking those who 
may be ready now or soon; too often we wait (and wait and hope) while those we 
deem appropriate complete this. We don’t take into account that sellers (or any 
influencers) are outsiders who can never understand how the status quo is kept 
in place, or add something to it. <p>
Offered too early our data, or pitch, or ‘rational argument’ is not seen as a 
reason to buy but as threats to the balance of the status quo when it may not be 
prepared to change. Sometimes our solution is not recognized as being needed 
because the Buying Decision Team hasn’t yet been fully assembled and needs 
haven’t been fully elicited.Sometimes they know they have a need but haven’t 
determined how to change congruently yet, or tried out all of the internal 
workarounds that might offer a resolution.<p>
It’s certainly possible that at the time we’re getting “No’s” our prospects are 
merely at a stuck stage and can easily move beyond it once they get 
understanding or internal agreement. When I hear sellers say that the status quo 
is ‘the enemy’ I know they are attempting to push against it with data, 
contacts, media. As I said above, nothing – not our brilliant pitches or 
presentations or charming personalities - from the outside will sway this stable 
beast.<p>
But there is a way to help our buyers facilitate the 13 steps to congruent 
change as part of our initiative. Instead of spending so much resource seeking 
only those who are ready (the low hanging fruit), we can recognize, and enter 
earlier, with those who will buy, and help them shift their status quo from 
within, using their own values and rules to seek and accept new solutions. It 
will require, however, an addition to the status quo of the selling model.<h2>
HOW THE STATUS QUO CHANGES</h2>
		<p>
Let’s begin by understanding how the status quo adopts change (I wrote a book on 
this. Read two free chapters: www.dirtylittlesecretsbook.com). And, regardless 
of the size or complexity of the problem, the path to congruent change is the 
same for all systems. It begins when something within recognizes something awry. 
It must then find a path to congruent change that includes consensus and change 
management. Knowing what needs to shift, having ‘good’ data on why the shift is 
necessary, or having a few elements willing to shift (without complete buy-in) 
does nothing to create change. There must be a thorough understanding of all the 
moving parts (i.e. you can’t get where you’re going until you know where you’re 
at). <p class="quote">
<b>Rule</b>: status quo must recognize rules, beliefs, norms, that must be maintained 
before considering change to avoid resistance and systems incongruence.<p>
To add anything foreign from the outside, the new must get buy-in from any 
people, policies, rules, and politics that would be affected. All change must be 
accompanied by a re-weighting of the norms of the status quo. The status quo 
itself must know exactly how it will be effected by anything new, and if it’s 
worth it to spend the energy mitigating itself to adopt. For this, everyone 
involved in maintaining the status quo must have a hand in defining the elements 
and understanding how change would effect it.<p class="quote">
<b>Rule</b>: assemble everyone/everything that makes up the status quo to determine 
how, if, why, when any change would be required or accepted.<p>
Once the status quo is coded, everyone/everything has bought in to change, the 
fallout from change must be considered and strategized. Change must be systemic 
and based on the values and rules that maintain it. Certainly no one from 
outside can cause the change.<p class="quote">
<b>Rule</b>: every element within the status quo must understand the potential fallout 
to change, and be willing to consider ways to adapt to, or align with, the new, 
or it will resist change regardless of the rewards.<p>
Unfortunately, the sales model doesn’t include this level of change 
facilitation; it occurs privately within the buying environment, during what 
sellers call the Pre-Sales, hidden, and highly personal portion of a pre-buying 
decision. I developed a model (Buying Facilitation®) that gives sellers a new 
tool kit to use with sales to manage systemic change and buy-in. I&#39;ve trained it 
with terrific results for decades. But make no mistake: it’s not a normal part 
of the selling process. <p>
The question is whether or not you want to change: to continue seeking those who 
have already accomplished this change management, or seek those you can lead 
through it as a change consultant first. You’d need to avoid gathering data and 
stop pitching until this has occurred and instead, begin by listening for 
systems and facilitating change. But then you’d have approximately 40% more real 
prospects who are ready, willing, and able to buy.<p>
Do you want to sell? Or have someone buy? They are two different activities. To 
facilitate buying, you must enter earlier as a Servant Leader and be willing to 
first be a change agent. Then you’d find and facilitate the journey with those 
who really need your solution but haven’t completed shifting the status quo yet. 
Potential buyers must first do this, with you or without you, as we sit and 
wait, or miss the opportunity entirely. Instead of seeking those who have 
already finished this and are in the 5% you can sell to, why not find those who 
WILL buy, facilitate them through their change, and become part of their status 
quo. It actually takes less time and closes more. So much easier, kinder, and 
more profitable than chasing the low hanging fruit. You&#39;d just have to change 
your status quo.<p>
