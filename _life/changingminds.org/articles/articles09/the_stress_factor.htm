<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: John Fillingham</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Nearly 20 years ago I discovered a cure for stress and I can confidently say my 
life has never been the same since. I revived the techniques I was taught all 
those years ago recently, after combining them with some back exercises a 
therapist taught me after a particular nasty back wrenching tennis match some 
months ago. I still hold dear the theory that the world (and therefore people&#8217;s 
lives) would be a much better place if we learned to control our stress levels.</p><p>
I had almost forgotten what it was like to be &#8220;cool as a cucumber&#8221; calm again, 
for a sustained period. For some people I know this could be quite a scary 
concept, they don&#8217;t feel alive if adrenalin isn&#8217;t racing through their body or 
there isn&#8217;t some crisis of immense proportions that needs their most urgent 
attention. Is that a feeling of wanting to be needed &#8211; I wonder.</p><p>
The demands of the modern world takes its toll on every aspect of our lives, 
from the lifestyle we must maintain to the hours at work we must put in to 
sustain it. Simply being alive can be a very challenging activity, is it easy 
then to overcome the toils and pains of life to live a trouble free existence?</p><p>
Living a trouble free life and controlling your stress are two very different 
things. If you are expecting an easy ride, hoping to miss all the things that 
&#8220;shouldn&#8217;t happen to me&#8221; then you would probably need to reset the model of your 
world you have created. Being &#8220;stress resistant&#8221; is what I prefer to call 
handling your stress well. Avoiding the irrational, thump, thump, thump of your 
heart racing when you hear the news that something isn&#8217;t right in your world 
takes effort, time and practice. It doesn&#8217;t change over night, but as they say, 
every journey begins with the first step.</p><p>
For anyone who has an emotional thermometer that feels sometimes more like a 
roller coaster, then you may share many of the feelings and experiences in this 
short article. For those of you more in control of yourselves, well done I say, 
lucky you. However, we all at times get a little hot under the collar when put 
in awkward situations, when 299 things land in our lap and suddenly we are 
expected to hit them all running. So the bottom line is, we could all do with a 
bit of stress control practice, even though for some of us it&#8217;s more of a 
necessity rather than a luxury.</p><p>
Let me start at a general level and work downwards, as best I can in this 
format. My first instruction is go visit a doctor and get expert medical advice 
before doing anything, for those of your don&#8217;t think you have the time or feel 
it&#8217;s unnecessary, please make the effort, it&#8217;s worth getting yourself checked 
before you do anything and get yourself an MOT!</p><p>
<b>My</b> <b>3 secrets to increasing your stress resistance</b> &#8211; Develop a positive attitude, 
practice breathing exercises and muscle control. </p>
<p>
Breathing is of course at the 
centre of it all, because it has an instantaneous impact on your heart rate, 
therefore on your stress level, the 2 are very closely connected. So <i>if you want 
to quickly calm yourself down at any time, concentrate on your breathing and 
slow it down, taking long, slow deep breaths</i>. It&#8217;s a great tip for those tense 
situations such as giving talks and presentations or asking your boss for a pay 
rise.</p><p>
So let&#8217;s begin with attitude, action is better than words as they say, indeed it 
is much better than &#8220;thinking&#8221; as often faulty thinking is a major root cause of 
stress. This is what I call &#8220;stress thinking&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;productive 
thinking&#8221; &#8211; remember those times when you&#8217;ve worked yourself up into a fury 
about something or worried about something so much, when it finally came to it, 
it was actually nothing like you expected &#8211; this is stress thinking in action.
</p><p>
So you have to <i>stop thinking so much and get on and do something</i>. Anything (well 
almost), but do something (positive). In life, <i>a positive attitude can make a 
huge difference</i> because you have to have the belief that you can make it better. 
This goes a long way in quickly switching your thinking from stress thinking to 
productive thinking. If you aren&#8217;t already a positive thinker by nature, then it 
will take some work but starting from a positive point of view may influence the 
outcomes of the situations you apply it to. If you can think of 1 million 
reasons why not, I can think of 1 million reasons why&#8230;.so tip it in favour of 
the positive, it&#8217;s a choice, so choose it and notice the difference.</p><p>
<i>When you smile, you relax, try it, it works.</i> I smile a lot. It often takes the 
heat out of situations and gives you another, often different perspective. 
Stress is often defined by the position/perspective you take, it seems like 
you&#8217;ve lost control, its out of your hands and you cant&#8217; do anything about it, 
so much is going on and you can&#8217;t stop the giant rock rolling down the hill. You 
can nudge the rock though and bounce if off in a different direction. <i>Tackle one 
thing at a time, prioritise</i>, so what really needs your energy, where do you put 
it, you simply can&#8217;t spread it too thin and expect to stay in once piece!</p><p>
Think of your brain as being like your laptop, too many programmes running, it 
slows down, ask it to do too much and the thing crashes and locks. Your mind is 
the like the memory of the computer, try to overload it and it can&#8217;t cope. 
Therefore important things I write down and put into my personal organiser and 
calendar for action, the rest I politely forget, I refuse to keep them in my 
short term memory, if they are really important to me, they will automatically 
go into long term memory.</p><p>
<b>Breath control </b>&#8211; in my exercise routine everyday, I build in some breathing 
exercises. I <i>take deep breaths, holding them for a few seconds and then let go</i>. 
For most of us who are office or desk bound, our sitting position does not 
promote healthy full lung breathing. The muscle (the diaphragm) that controls 
our lungs is compressed when sitting down, therefore we spend most of our time 
taking shallow breaths, starving our bodies of the oxygen it needs to live fully 
and provide us with maximum energy. I used to do a full 20/30 minutes worth of 
these exercises, mixing it in with my gym workouts, I believe it&#8217;s really worth 
it. <i>The greatest benefit comes from lowering the heart rate and making you feel 
relaxed &#8211; it&#8217;s a key cure for stress</i>.</p><p>
<b>Muscle control </b>&#8211; one of the key things I learned all that time ago, is that 
stress usually manifests itself in a physical way, headaches, stomach ache and 
so on and they clearly show you that you are in a &#8220;stressed&#8221; state of mind. A 
technique for change is to <i>do something physical to change your mental state</i>. 
Working on the different muscle groups in the body, from head to toe, tensing 
and relaxing the muscles with physical movements is one way, stretching and 
exercising another.</p><p>
For me the essential ingredient in finding suitable cures for stress (and they 
can take different forms for every person &#8211; <i>music is often a &#8220;mood changer&#8221;</i> and 
therefore a stress cure for me) is the &#8220;me time&#8221; element. <b>Dedicating some time, 
purely and selfishly just for you &#8211; even if it is only for 10 or 15 minutes a 
day is absolutely, the most important fundamental element in saving your sanity 
and relieving your stress.</b> </p>
