Seven Simple Exercises to Invite the Extraordinary Life</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: </i>Guy Finley</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can think of no greater encouragement than the self-evident Truth that 
there dwells in each of us the opportunity to explore and know the Extraordinary 
Life. The meaning of Extraordinary I wish to convey points to the immutable and 
inexhaustible source that is the secret center of each of us: a timeless 
resource open and available to anyone who would seek this Life that sits behind 
life as we know it. Will we spend our lives in mere dreams of winning a 
limitless life, or will we do the inner- work of awakening from this dream? 
Choosing the Extraordinary Life begins with our conscious work to realize it, 
which the following special practices help to ensure. </p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Let Nagging Questions Go Unanswered:</b> In stressful moments, listen to what 
life is trying to tell you about you instead of searching anxiously for familiar 
answers to make life feel &quot;right&quot; again. All fearful, doubt-filled moments are 
secret reflections of what we have yet to understand about life and ourselves, 
not life's rejection of us or our wish for happiness. Choose to go consciously 
quiet whenever there is a riot in you. Refuse to take part in the search to 
repair what you fear may be coming undone. Let go and watch what happens when 
you consciously sacrifice the fear-filled self. This new action allows the 
Extraordinary Life to enter into you where its presence alone proves that all is 
well. </li>
  <li><b>Don't Make the Rescue Call: </b>In times of anxiety and fear, we almost always 
call upon someone or something to help us get through our stress. This 
dependency on others for strength not only weakens our soul, but also steals 
from it the possibility of being educated by the Extraordinary Life, which means 
we miss two major lessons. First, the crucial lesson that all our fears are 
based upon false evidence that appears real. With this revelation comes our 
second realization that the same frightened self that seeks rescue secretly 
confirms its imagined condition as being real each time it cries out for help. 
Refusing to rescue ourselves from inner states that scare us invites the 
Extraordinary Life that shows us that no such scared self exists that needs 
saving. </li>
  <li><b>Take the Hard Way: </b>Rut and routine are two sides of the same sad street. 
Repetitive patterns are the well-worn pavement that our spiritually asleep self 
loves to tread while it talks us to death with its empty promises of 
extraordinary times &quot;just ahead.&quot; We can learn to do much better let ourselves 
be betrayed in this way, but it takes inner work! Instead of caving into the 
demands of those slipshod parts of ourselves always looking for the easy way 
out, we must choose in favor of what our false nature wants us to see as being 
the &quot;hard&quot; way. But it's not. In fact, once we learn that the only real way out 
of what we would rather avoid is to go through it, we discover another 
self-liberating truth: the only thing that's hard on us is when we allow our 
unenlightened nature to convince us that getting around something is the same as 
rising above it. </li>
  <li><b>Do the Thing You Fear Doing: </b>There is a correct time and place for 
thinking through practical plans in the ordinary scheme of life's events. But 
nothing that is founded in thought can serve to reveal the unthinkable plans 
that the Extraordinary holds in store for anyone willing to leap into the moment 
without a parachute. Never mind those old fears of falling. Just jump! Being 
willing to risk failing is a prerequisite for fearless living. If you will take 
the leap into what you are afraid of doing, the Extraordinary Life will prove to 
you that Its unshakable ground is everywhere beneath you at all times. Nothing 
compares with this discovery because, once realized, there's nowhere to go but 
up! A note of caution: taking a spiritual leap is far different from taking a 
reckless physical risk. Never risk the well being of your physical body for the 
sake of a passing thrill: for what is possible to attain with a body, cannot be 
without one. The temporary rush of adrenalin has nothing in common with one's 
awakening to the reality of a timeless, fearless life. </li>
  <li><b>Take Time Out from Yourself Every Day:</b> Unseen by the self that walks upon 
it, thought is a treadmill powered by the movement of our yesterdays as they 
produce our tomorrows. This is the real meaning of &quot;doing time.&quot; The domain of 
the Extraordinary Life is Timeless. To share Its life, we must enter into Its 
world. Here is a good way to begin this Work: Every day, as often as can be 
remembered, chose to break out of that gilded, but self-confining cage called 
&quot;thinking about yourself.&quot; We live under the power of these unconscious 
ponderings, for when they turn dark and stormy, it is we who are left out in the 
cold. Even if we can only collect ourselves to meditate, pray or contemplate a 
Higher Idea for a few minutes at a time, we must do it anyway. These small 
windows - opened by our work to remember the Extraordinary Life : grant us 
passage into its timeless domain. </li>
  <li><b>Open Yourself to Life: </b>Dare to see and experience yourself as you are 
without giving names to all the varied emotional sensations that present 
themselves before your watchful inner eyes. Allow the meaning of whatever states 
you see coming up in you to reveal their actual nature to you. Resist the 
temptation to interrupt their upwelling by explaining to yourself what you are 
experiencing. Have no intention toward these thoughts and feelings other than to 
be open to them and, in doing so, to permit them their uninterrupted passage 
through you. Why open up to life in this way? For one thing, this gives negative 
states the back door they need to depart. For another, the Extraordinary Life is 
very possessive. It will not enter any zone marked &quot;occupied.&quot; </li>
  <li><b>Make No Campsites: </b>The Extraordinary Life visits individuals, not groups 
or organizations. It strengthens the soul willing to be alone for its sake. Keep 
your distance from people who insist that you believe as they do, who hope to 
convince you that the reality they have satisfied themselves with should satisfy 
you as well. These deceivers want only to keep you in their unreal camp. Never 
mind who is walking with you and who isn't. Be wary of any campsite - inner or 
outer - with its bright &quot;welcome weary traveler&quot; sign. Most of these campers 
desire your company so that they can forget they are going nowhere. Walk on! 
Your persistence is an open invitation to the Extraordinary Life to show you the 
Way back home. </li>
