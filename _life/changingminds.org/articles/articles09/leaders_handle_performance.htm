Leaders Handle Performance Problems</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Jim Clemmer</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="quote"><i>&quot;Our chief want in life is somebody who can make us do what 
we can.&quot; &#8212; Ralph Waldo Emerson</i></p>
<p>A water bearer in India had two pots attached to each end of a pole. He would 
sling the pole over his shoulders to carry water from the stream to his house 
every day. One of the pots was cracked and leaked water. The other one was 
perfect. One day the cracked pot spoke to the water bearer about its shame and 
apologized for dripping water while the other pot never lost a drop. The water 
bearer replied to the pot, &quot;Yes, you are cracked and do not carry water as well 
your brother pot. But you have an ability that he does not have. Did you notice 
there were flowers on your side of the path, but not on the other pot's side? 
That's because I have always known about your flaw and took advantage of it. I 
planted flower seeds on your side of the path and every day while we walk back 
from the stream you have watered them.&quot; </p>
<p>Strong leaders know that we're all cracked pots. Perfect people are in very 
short supply! In fact, that may be just as well: As Abraham Lincoln once said, 
&quot;It has been my experience that men who have no vices have very few virtues.&quot;
</p>
<p>Such human traits can, however, cause problems, especially in the workplace. 
And when performance problems arise, they need to be confronted. Like porcupines 
in love, such discussions are painful for both parties. That's often why 
managers avoid them. Leaders, however, know that poor performance is like a 
highly contagious disease. The longer it goes unchecked, the more everyone 
suffers. As Publius Syrus said, &quot;He harms the good who spares the bad.&quot; Here is 
what some of today's experts have to say about the subject: </p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;Keeping poor performers means that development opportunities for 
  promising employees get blocked, so those subordinates don't get developed, 
  productivity and morale fall, good performers leave the company, the company 
  attracts fewer 'A' players, and the whole miserable cycle keeps turning&#8230; 
  Refusing to deal with underperformers not only makes your best employees 
  unhappy, but it also makes them think the company is run by bozos&#8230; Successful 
  companies deal with underperformers systematically, every day; unsuccessful 
  companies don't.&quot; &#8212; Geoffrey Colvin, &quot;Make Sure You Chop the Dead Wood,&quot; 
  Fortune </li>
  <li>&quot;I feel there is no greater disrespect you can do to a person than to let 
  them hang out in a job where they are not respected by their peers, not viewed 
  as successful, and probably losing their self-esteem. To do that under the 
  guise of respect for people is, to me, ridiculous.&quot; &#8212; Debra Dunn, senior 
  executive Hewlett-Packard </li>
  <li>&quot;Easing someone's path does not mean simply providing the path of least 
  resistance. Sometimes the best way to help people is to hold them responsible; 
  accepting no excuses can sometimes be the best kind of aid we can offer.&quot; &#8212; 
  William Bennett, The Moral Compass . In The Contrarian's Guide to Leadership, 
  Steven B. Sample, President of the University Of Southern California explains 
  that leaders sometimes need to adopt a hands-on approach to inspire their 
  teams: </li>
</ul>
<p class="quote"><i>&quot;If a would-be leader wants glamor, he should try acting in 
the movies. However, if he in fact wants to make a consequential impact on a 
cause or an organization, he needs to roll up his sleeves and be prepared to 
perform a series of grungy chores which are putatively beneath him, and for 
which he'll never receive recognition or credit, but by virtue of which his 
lieutenants will be inspired and enabled to achieve great things.&quot; </i></p>
<p>So much of what a manager does makes it difficult for people to get their 
work done. &quot;I am from head office and I am here to help you,&quot; sends the snicker 
meter over the red line in many organizations. Too often managers have made it 
harder for people on the front lines to get their job done. Strong coaches start 
by building agreement or buy-in to roles and goals. Then they flip things around 
and serve their teams and organizations. </p>
<p>At a technical services company a manager declared a series of &quot;junk days&quot; 
for the technicians in the field. He pulled together a group of internal and 
external suppliers of the equipment the technicians were using and took them out 
on tour. He invited technicians to attend the meeting in a local hotel room and 
bring out all their defective equipment along with their work-around strategies. 
The internal and external suppliers were told that they were there only to 
listen and learn. They were not to rationalize, defend, excuse, or explain. They 
were to speak only with questions for clarity. As the tour moved from city to 
city, the manager and the suppliers kept careful notes on the trends emerging 
and the many innovative solutions they encountered. At the end of the tour, 
decisions were made, new prototypes developed, and procedures changed. They then 
went back out on tour to get reactions and make further modifications. The 
result was a surge in morale, productivity, and effectiveness of the 
technicians.</p>
