<h1>How to Lose Your Job without Being Fired</h1>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="../articles.htm">Guest articles</a> &gt; How to Lose Your Job without Being Fired</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Richard Skaare</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I never expected an epiphany from an Englishman over pancakes in a central 
Pennsylvania diner. </p>
<p>My friend and I were meeting, as we did periodically, at our favorite 
restaurant &#8212; appropriately named Brothers &#8212; to laugh, gossip, and counsel each 
another. It was his turn to disentangle my life. </p>
<p>He said, &#8220;Your blessing and bane, Richard, is that you <i>comfort the 
afflicted and afflict the comfortable</i>.&#8221; Whoa! He signaled the waitress for more coffee.
</p>
<p>Being affirmed for comforting the afflicted was humbling. But the second 
comment about afflicting the comfortable got my brain cylinders firing. I 
realized that&#8217;s really what I do as a professional communicator and change 
instigator:</p><p>
I craftily tell clients what I heard them tell me so they understand what will 
happen when they try to tell others.</p><p>
The echo frees them, sometimes stuns them, occasionally saddens them, and either 
immediately or later drives them to fight or flight, usually the latter &#8211; though 
sometimes flight eventually turns to fight in subtle ways. Change is 
uncomfortable. I create discomfort to create change. </p>
<p><b>Are you also an afflicter? </b>If yes, you&#8217;re probably not a whiner or a 
crusader; you&#8217;re just unsettled and unsettling. Fortunately, you are what 
entrenched organizations need, especially in tough times. Unfortunately, there 
are bosses and colleagues out there who don&#8217;t know what to do with you. </p>
<h2>3 strange disrupters that could get you into trouble </h2>
<h3>1 Performance</h3><p>
This seems like an odd disrupter. Don&#8217;t we get rewarded for performance? You 
would think so. But some departments, even whole organizations, seem prone to 
<i>generating more heat than light</i> &#8211; that is, creating the appearance of progress 
without being accountable for tangible results. </p>
<p>Four hours of work gets inflated to eight hours, grumbling surfaces whenever 
a new assignment comes in, and problems consume more time than possibilities.
</p>
<p>In such an environment, <i>good performers disrupt mediocrity</i>. </p>
<p>If you inadvertently upstage members of the team by producing an outstanding 
piece of work, they will be impressed, envious, and won&#8217;t forget.</p><p>
If you diplomatically suggest at a staff meeting an idea you have about 
reprioritizing or restructuring for greater impact, your boss will appreciate 
your idea and feel slightly upstaged.</p><p>
And, silly as it sounds, even if you regularly meet deadlines, your boss may not 
have thought through the sequel to the assignments he gave you and now doesn&#8217;t 
know what to do with the results. He procrastinates, you wait, and when you ask 
for an update more than once, he gets testy because you&#8217;re &#8230; well, pushy.</p><p>
You will get a merit increase for outstanding performance. However, you may have 
been moved one ring out from the center for the pain you imparted. </p>
<h3>2 Reasonableness</h3><p>
What baffles you is that the ideas and changes you propose seem so obvious, so 
simple, and so doable and yet never gain any traction in the organization. </p>
<p>Take, for instance, your cost-saving, streamlining idea to move a particular 
administrative process online. Sounds reasonable. However, support staff worry 
about what they will now do, yet they don&#8217;t speak up. And your boss? She&#8217;s 
uneasy that the fat weekly report won&#8217;t show up in her in-box, regardless if she 
was reading it or not. But she can&#8217;t admit that. So, your suggestion goes to 
committee. </p>
<p>Then, one of your work buddies pulls you aside at lunch and suggests that, 
though folks admire you, you might want to stop trying to change everything and 
just focus on the work at hand. Don&#8217;t be getting people worried unnecessarily, 
he says. </p>
<p>Move back one more ring. </p>
<h3>3 Professionalism</h3><p>
Sometime during the first year of your new job, you realize that the currency of 
your education and expertise, which landed you the position and, you thought, 
credibility and authority, didn&#8217;t end up buying you much. </p>
<p>As the communication director, maybe you turned the organization&#8217;s 
publications into a portal in a culture where publications are still sacred.</p><p>
As the new lawyer, you closed loopholes to protect the organization only to hear 
that some in management considered you unrealistic and inflexible.</p><p>
As a freshly-minted MBA in operations, you recommended a systems change to 
decrease inventory costs, and then saw the suspicious looks of veteran 
production managers.</p><p>
Sure, <i>you get nods for smarts, but you also get demerits for always taking the 
side road</i>. You&#8217;re not considered a team player. You are now on the outside. </p>
<p>What often happens to most nice disrupters (a.k.a change agents) is that they 
get marginalized. No one can find &#8211; or admit &#8212; fault, yet no one completely 
warms up to you. The boss likes your affability but not your subtle 
intimidation. He can&#8217;t fire you for cause and, besides, he doesn&#8217;t want to look 
like he made a mistake hiring you. He hopes you might consider leaving, though 
he can&#8217;t suggest that.</p><p>
Sometimes this malaise lasts for years until, finally, some fortuitous opening 
occurs: you get squeezed by an inflated ethical issue; you get blamed for some 
executive gaffe, or a budget crunch hits. Then, you are likely to be reassigned 
or offered an attractive severance. In other words, you don&#8217;t get fired, you 
just lose your job. </p>
<p>I know this all sounds bleak, but it&#8217;s too real for too many talented 
individuals in the wrong place at the wrong time in their careers. If you&#8217;re 
caught in this vise, be encouraged. </p>
<p>5 Affirmations </p>
<ol>
  <li>You are an instigator for change because you are wired to serve people not 
processes. Just be sure you check yourself regularly to prevent frustration from 
turning instigation into aggravation.</li>
  <li>Your colleagues do like you &#8212; really. It&#8217;s just that you raise the questions 
they have tried to repress. With kids in college and fear of job loss, they 
worry more about security than options.</li>
  <li>You are in your current position to increase your professional value, which adds 
to the value of your employer whether or not some people see it that way.</li>
  <li>You wish the world acted reasonably, but you are a change instigator because you 
are intuitive. You perceive and understand what others cannot. It&#8217;s a gift. 
Treasure it.</li>
  <li>Your resume is your journal of growth. Add to it regularly.</li>
</ol>
