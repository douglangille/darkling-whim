10 keys to sales success in a down economy</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Mark Anthony, President of Training For Success</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A well planned script is one of the telemarketer&#8217;s most powerful tools. 
Enthusiasm combined with a strong presentation will motivate a prospect to buy. 
However, as the customer becomes more savvy and competition mounts top 
telemarketers must find ways to stand apart from the pack. </p>
<p>To create a presentation that motivates, you must go beyond clearly conveying 
the benefits of owning your product. Psychological selling elevates taking a 
qualified contact to new standards in professional telemarketing skills. </p>
<p>The telemarketers must focus on studying the clients needs and how they can 
satisfy the individual customer. To minimize call resistance the prospect must 
be allowed to buy what they want and get the benefits which fulfill the values 
they perceive are necessary. By incorporating 10 powerful Psychology of Selling 
tools into your sales presentation you will strengthen your customer 
relationships and shorten the sales process. </p>
<p>1. Interview the prospect to learn their needs. An interactive dialogue is a 
more complicated and skilled presentation then simply reading a one sided 
&#8220;pitch&#8221; but the results are significantly more profitable. All high ticket items 
and any manager interested in improving their close rate must involve the 
prospect beyond simple yes or no answers. </p>
<p>2. Proper questions reveal what the client really wants and why they want it. 
To gain closing ammunition the telemarketers want to know how the prospect knows 
they have satisfied their needs and what must happen for the client to realize 
they have it. As questioning skills develop the salesperson will learn to 
understand the prospect as a person and individual. </p>
<p>3. Understand key motivation for owning your product. Every purchase comes 
down to people needing to satisfy the emotions of greed, ego, fear, love, or 
self development. People buy emotion! Top producers challenge old habits such as 
selling common facts and benefits. Top producers sell to satisfy emotion. </p>
<p>When ego, fear or one of the other key emotions are sold the prospect is 
rapidly moved to the close. There is a strong psychological need to satisfy and 
protect those emotions. People spend their money to get the pleasures of 
satisfying those needs. It is a priority to protect themselves from the pain of 
having a void in those emotional areas. </p>
<p>4. Logic pales to emotion. The initial reason a prospect considers buying is 
for the emotional satisfaction your product offers. The owning of features is 
only a tool that helps fulfill a greater psychological need. The motivating 
force that propels people to buy is the need to attain intangible values and the 
specific psychological needs owning your product satisfies. Remember: people 
will use logic to justify their purchases but they buy for emotional reasons.
</p>
<p>Trigger emotions by carefully planning your questions. Concentrate on tapping 
into the emotions that are touched by owning your product. </p>
<p>5. Get Them Talking! A simple statement such as; &#8220;Can I ask you a few brief 
questions to save time and see if I can satisfy your needs&#8221; will get the 
prospect into the right frame of mind to answer all of your probing questions. 
That brief statement offers two benefits, saving time and satisfying the 
prospects needs. Secondly, you tear down defensive walls when you allude to the 
fact that your product may not be appropriate. Lastly, it is a powerful question 
because the prospect feels they are in control even though you are the one 
guiding them. </p>
<p>6. Are they ready to buy? As you support your case with facts and benefits 
you want to test if the prospect is ready to be closed. You can minimize fatal 
closing objections if you test the prospects buying readiness with a trial 
close. </p>
<p>The average person hates to make a decision. They often can&#8217;t decide on which 
movie to see Saturday night. Getting the prospect to commit to a major purchase 
is even more difficult. On the other hand they will add their two cents when 
it's not their decision. Human nature encourages people to want to share their 
opinions and thoughts. People feel important when they are asked their opinion 
and they feel good giving it. </p>
<p>By specifically asking the prospect your closing question with the words &#8220;in 
your opinion&#8221; preceding it you turn a decision making formal close into a 
comfortable trial close. The trial response tells you how ready the person is to 
making a buying decision. If you get a highly favorable answer to your trial 
close you can ask a formal closing question. If you receive a cold or mildly 
warm response you still need to do some desire development. </p>
<p>7. Create a buying mood with the word yes. By getting your prospect to say 
yes six times during the presentation you greatly increase the odds of getting a 
favorable response to your closing statement. Six yeses get the person into an 
agreeable state of mind. They become comfortable saying yes to you. The prospect 
&#8216;s yes responses breakthrough negative defenses. Most importantly the prospect 
is now psychologically in the right mind set to allow themselves to say yes to a 
purchase decision. How many simple questions that can elicit a yes response can 
you structure into your presentation? </p>
<p>8. Enthusiasm and smiles. Enthusiasm is contagious. If you are enthusiastic 
about your product, you will be more successful. This is crucial in 
telemarketing. Your voice is your greatest asset in conveying the attributes of 
your product or service. </p>
<p>If you are excited, your prospect will sense that there is something good 
here. It is your enthusiasm that brings a script to life. </p>
<p>Smiling is one of the most natural ways to bring your enthusiasm to the 
surface. When we simile, we are friendlier, more energetic and enthusiastic. 
Even when you don&#8217;t feel like smiling, do it. Your mind will automatically be 
triggered into a happier state of being. </p>
<p>9. Script and pad. Even the simplest of presentations should be written out. 
A script allows you to select the most appropriate wording to move your prospect 
through the sales process and to use that wording on each and every call. Even 
more important, having a script in front of you allows you to put your energy 
into listening to the prospect rather than thinking about what to say next. </p>
<p>When you uncover an important need, problem or interest of the prospect&#8217;s, 
jot it down. Writing it down assures that you will remember the point, work it 
into your presentation and leaves your mind clear to listen for more vital 
information. </p>
<p>10. Going beyond words: To establish trust and likability the telemarketer 
must speak in a manner that makes the prospect comfortable. People like and 
trust those folks that are similar to themselves. By carefully monitoring your 
words, speech patterns and voice tones you can create an environment that 
quickly establishes positive rapport. </p>
<p>People have different definitions for the same words. For instance, one 
prospect may say they want to buy a mutual fund with a great track record and 
the representative says they have a fund with an excellent track record. 
Unfortunately by the prospects definition great may be better than excellent, 
therefore resulting in some uneasiness. The prospect may feel that there are 
different connotations to the word &#8220;excellent&#8221; compared to &#8220;great&#8221; which results 
in the two parties being on slightly different wave lengths. The simplest 
solution is to carefully listen to the words your prospect uses and adopt them 
into your conversation on a case by case basis. You will be viewed as someone 
who understands the prospect&#8217;s viewpoints and that &#8220;speaks their language.&#8221; </p>
<p>Speech patterns are equally important. Are you a &#8220;fast talking Yankee&#8221; or a 
slow talking &#8220;robot&#8221;? The only right answer is to be in sync with your 
prospects. If they speak slowly and you speak rapidly you may be viewed as a 
&#8220;smooth talking hustler.&#8221; On the other hand the slow talking telemarketer may 
make the fast talking prospect very uncomfortable. The prospect may become 
impatient and feel the telemarketer is not being responsive. As you verbally 
dance with your prospect you must gracefully follow their pace. </p>
<p>Tone of voice often communicates more than the words selected. Do you convey 
excitement with words such as terrific, fantastic and great? Does concern come 
through in your message as you ask about goals, objectives and challenges facing 
your prospect? Does your voice resonate with confidence as you make 
recommendations, state facts, benefits and ask for the order? </p>
<p>In telemarketing your voice becomes your body language. Similar to the way we 
select our words and pace of speech is the use of voice tone. We must speak in a 
manner that our customer can relate to. Does your voice tone over power or 
comfort the soft spoken prospect? Are you portrayed as confident and competent 
in the eyes of the prospect who uses a commanding tone? </p>
<p>As you develop the psychological rapport building technique of modeling the 
prospects words, speech pattern and voice tone you begin to melt the icy 
reception that greets many telemarketers. </p>
<p>When you develop the habit of building your clients trust by appealing to 
their emotional needs and values you create a loyal customer base. By 
structuring your presentation and speech to the individual prospect you are 
better suited to guide your customer to the appropriate decision. </p>
<p>Your staffs telemarketing success can be further leveraged as each member of 
your team takes stock of their daily communication habits and evaluates each of 
their strengths and weaknesses. When a quality script is combined with sincerely 
meeting the needs of the prospect you are an organization that communicates 
genuine value. The reward is a motivated sales team, happy customers and a 
profitable bottom line. </p>
