You Either Brighten The World Or Darken The World. What Are You Doing Today?</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Dr. Alan Zimmerman</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether you know it or not, whether you like it or not, you make a 
difference. Everything you say and do makes a difference. Your words and deeds 
are either brightening the world or darkening the world. </p>
<p>Sometimes you create brightness. You say some things that put more hope and 
life into your personal and professional relationships. At other times you 
create darkness. You do some things that kill off the hope and life in your 
relationships. </p>
<p>Of course, you and I could list a thousand things that brighten or darken 
relationships but let me discuss two of the most important things. In fact, if 
you did nothing more than these two things, your relationships would improve on 
and off the job. </p>
<p>First, REFUSE TO USE SARCASM. It always darkens relationships because it 
always destroys a piece of the other person. It makes the other person the butt 
of jokes and the object of scorn. And sarcasm always puts the other person down 
instead of lifting him up. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, sarcasm is one of the more common forms of communication these 
days. Almost every TV sitcom is filled with sarcasm, and in many cases, it is 
the only form of humor used. It's one put down after another. So it's no wonder 
that people begin to think that sarcasm is funny, witty, and even okay to use in 
their own relationships. </p>
<p>Examples are everywhere. One plumbing company in northeast Pennsylvania uses 
the slogan, &quot;Don't sleep with a drip. Call your plumber. &quot;I admit it's very 
clever, but I also wonder about the put downs some spouses might give each other 
when their attempted home repairs didn't work out. </p>
<p>Or think about the conflicts that just naturally come with every 
relationship. I think some people spend more time looking for clever lines to 
deliver in the midst of conflict than they do looking for skills to resolve the 
conflict. Take, for example, the person that said, &quot;I don't have an attitude 
problem. You have a perception problem. &quot; Someone else said, &quot;Love is blind, but 
marriage is a real eye opener. &quot;And finally, &quot;Love is grand. Divorce is a 
hundred grand. &quot;I can just imagine any one of those lines being used in a nasty 
husband-wife argument, and the conflict getting worse. </p>
<p>So refuse to use sarcasm, no matter how clever you sound or how much you want 
to say it. Sarcasm may be okay for the sitcoms and the occasional laugh, but 
just remember, sitcoms aren't reality. In the world you and I live in, sarcasm 
only darkens the world. </p>
<p>Second, make it a point to SHOW KINDNESS EVERY DAY. Whether it's your 
customer, your coworker, or someone at home, simply ask yourself, &quot;What can I do 
right now to make that person's life a little better?&quot; Maybe you listen for 
thirty seconds, give a compliment, help carry a package, or find a telephone 
number. Just do something to brighten that person's world. You'll almost always 
get a better relationship in return. </p>
<p>I remember reading in Guideposts magazine about an American family in France 
many years ago. It was Christmas Eve, and it was a cold, depressing, rainy 
evening. They were tired and irritable. Their car had broken down, so they 
stopped at a dismal little restaurant about dinnertime. </p>
<p>There were only five tables in the room that were occupied. One had a French 
family, and they were fighting. The French father slapped his little son, and he 
was crying loudly. A German family was also arguing. The wife was berating her 
husband. And over in a corner a piano player was listlessly playing Christmas 
music. The only person in the room who seemed happy was an American sailor. He 
was writing a letter to his sweetheart, judging from his facial expression, and 
had a half-smile on his face. </p>
<p>Then there came an uncomfortable draft of cold air. Through the open door 
came an old woman, a seller of flowers. Water was dripping off her long 
overcoat, and her shoes were soggy wet. She held in her hands a few little 
corsages. She went over to the American family and said, &quot;Flowers, monsieur? 
Only one franc. &quot;But no, they didn't want any. Then she approached the French 
family:&quot; One franc, monsieur?&quot; They didn't want it either. Nor did the German 
family want a corsage. </p>
<p>So she sat down, discouraged, and said to the piano player, &quot;Joseph, it's 
Christmas Eve, and I haven't sold any flowers all day long. &quot;She called to the 
waiter and said, &quot;A bowl of soup, please. &quot;Turning back to the piano player, she 
continued, &quot;Joseph, think of it--only a bowl of soup on Christmas Eve. &quot;He 
points to his tipping plate which was empty. A glum, semi-hostile silence 
descended on them all. </p>
<p>Then the sailor finished his letter and walked over to the old flower woman 
and said, &quot;Madame, how much are your flowers?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;One franc, monsieur. &quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I'll take two corsages. &quot;He pressed one flat, put it in with the letter and 
sealed the envelope. Then he handed her a twenty-franc note. </p>
<p>&quot;I have no change, monsieur,&quot; she said. </p>
<p>&quot;Ah, that's my Christmas gift to you. You know, you somehow remind me of my 
grandmother. &quot;Then he leaned down, kissed her cheek and said, &quot;Happy Christmas!&quot;
</p>
<p>He then took the other corsage and walked over to the American family, bowed 
to the husband and said, &quot;Sir, will you permit me to present this corsage to 
your beautiful daughter?&quot; And with that he was gone. </p>
<p>Then Christmas exploded in the restaurant. The old flower woman danced around 
and said to Joseph, &quot;This is my Christmas present! I'm going to give half of it 
to you so that we can have a feast together! Isn't it wonderful?&quot; And the 
pianist was pounding out Christmas melodies like never before, and the beautiful 
&quot;daughter,&quot; alias the wife, had stars in her eyes as she smelled the flowers.
</p>
<p>Then they began to sing, in German, French and English, the old carols that 
span all languages: &quot;Stille Nacht, Heilige Nacht,&quot; &quot;O Tannenbaum,&quot; and so on. 
The place was filled with music, so much so that the American went home and 
wrote a letter to the admiral of the fleet and said, &quot;Somewhere in your forces 
is a young sailor who gave a very special gift to my family, to me and to the 
other people in that French Restaurant. Because your young sailor had the 
Christmas spirit in his soul, he released the love and joy that had been 
smothered within us by anger and disappointment. He gave us Christmas. &quot; </p>
<p>That's how kindness works. When you make someone's life a little better, when 
you brighten his/her world, relationships improve. </p>
<h3>Action on interpersonal communication: </h3>
<p>Take on the kindness challenge. For one day this week, show a little kindness 
to every person you meet. Watch their response. Pay attention to how you feel. 
And if you like what you see and how you feel, then take on the kindness 
challenge for another day.</p>
