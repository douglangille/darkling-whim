Building Your Sales Metric Management System In 4 Easy Steps</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Lee B. Salz</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="quote"><i>Every sales manager is searching for revenue from their salesforce, but the 
recipe to achieving the revenue target comes from the development of their 
unique sales metric management system. </i> </p>
<p>Thinking back to one of the great cult films of the 1980s&#8230;Caddyshack. There 
is a conversation between Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) and Judge Smails (Ted Knight) in 
the locker room after Ty has just finished a round of golf. Judge Smails asks Ty 
what he shot that day and Ty responds by telling the Judge that he doesn't keep 
score. Puzzled, Judge Smails says, &quot;How do you measure yourself with other 
golfers?&quot; Ty responds by saying, &quot;By height.&quot; </p>
<p>Obviously, height doesn't tell you anything about a golfer's performance 
which is why that dialogue is humorous. Yet, there is nothing funny about a 
sales organization that is using meaningless, arbitrary data to assess the 
performance of their sales team. Even worse is if the only number tracked, 
measured, and monitored is revenue quota attainment. </p>
<p>When I conduct workshops on building a sales metric management system, the 
first metric that the group usually mentions for inclusion is revenue. <u>Revenue 
is not a metric. It is a result</u>. There is nothing that sales managers can do to 
address revenue. They can, however, work with a sales person on specific 
activity levels that lead to quota attainment. In essence, the statistical 
components of your sales metric management system create a success roadmap for 
your sales people. If they are achieving the metrics in the system, they will be 
blowing out their revenue targets. </p>
<p>There are four steps to identifying the metrics for inclusion in your sales 
metric management system. </p>
<ol>
	<li><b>Measurable</b>. If the area of the business you want to measure cannot be 
measured statistically, then how will you know whether or not it is working? 
This seems like circular logic, but I often hear about &quot;trusting your gut&quot; as a 
measurable statistic. Needless to say, gut instinct does not belong in a sales 
metric management system. There needs to be a way to track the data easily and 
efficiently. <br>
	<br>
	For example, if you wanted to track the number of outbound calls made by your 
sales team, but that data was not tracked anywhere, you would not be able to 
measure it. Thus, outbound calls would not be part of your sales metric 
management system as it is not measurable. Search for other data points that 
reflect performance that is measurable. If you find that many of the areas you 
want to measure are not measurable, you may need to look at your CRM. It may 
need to be reconfigured or replaced altogether. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Meaningful</b>. Just because you can measure a data point, it doesn't mean 
that it belongs in your sales metric management system. Like sports, there is no 
end to the data that can be measured in a sales organization. Sportscasters 
commonly use a series of statistics to present how well or terribly a player is 
performing. Easily, a set of counterpoint data could be presented showing the 
opposite point of view. <br>
	<br>
	I recall my time as a sales management executive where on any given day I 
could put together a series of data that would support promoting or firing any 
member of the sales team including myself. The key is to select the most 
critical activities that drive the sales person's success and include those in 
your sales metric management system. For each metric, ask yourself what that 
data tells you relative to the sales person achieving their revenue goal. The 
meaningful ones go in your system while the others are cast aside. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Goal-oriented</b>. Statistics without goals tell you very little about 
performance. Each statistical component of your sales metric management system 
needs to have a corresponding goal. When performance discussions take place with 
the sales person, their performance versus goal achievement serves as the center-point 
of the agenda. This is a significant change from the typical discussions that 
are focused on whether or not sales quota was attained. <br>
	<br>
	When setting the goal-levels for your sales metric management system, there 
is an important consideration. Thinking back to report cards from school, 
students achieved a letter grade based on their performance. A few kids received 
an &quot;A&quot; which meant they had delivered stellar performance. However, average 
performance reflected a &quot;C&quot; on the report card. If your sales person achieved 
the goal for a particular metric, what does that mean? Was their performance 
exceptional? Or did they perform at the mere minimum acceptable level to keep 
their job? <br>
	<br>
	If you set your goal levels so that they mean A-level performance, you should 
expect few of your sales people to hit them. If you set them at the C-level, you 
are establishing the baseline for minimum acceptable performance. There isn't a 
right or wrong approach between the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot; philosophies. The key is to 
select one, understand its meaning relative to performance, and handle 
achievement accordingly. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Trainable</b>. The final component is to identify the mentoring that can be 
provided to a sales person who is not achieving a defined metric in the system. 
Since the metrics that you are managing are critical to a sales person's success 
(meaningful), deficiencies cannot be left unaddressed. When you identify each 
metric for the system, if a sales person is not achieving it, what potential 
weaknesses does it expose in their arsenal? As a sales manager, you can then 
begin digging to determine the root cause and help the sales person improve. <br>
	<br>
	Just like many think that revenue is a metric, many think that if a sales 
person is failing to achieve their revenue quota that they cannot close. It's 
possible that closing is the issue. However, if you have your sales metric 
management system in place, you may find that closing isn't the issue at all. 
Perhaps, the sales person doesn't have enough activity in their pipeline. Or, 
that they struggle to move prospects through the buying process. Or, any of 
countless other possible deficiencies. Managers who have their sales metric 
management system in place can quickly identify the problem area and address it.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>Designing your sales metric management system well-positions you to create an 
effective sales compensation plan. Remember, your sales compensation plan tells 
your sales people where to invest their selling time. Thus, the compensation 
plan reinforces your sales metric management system. If you would like my sales 
metric management system worksheet, send me an email. </p>
