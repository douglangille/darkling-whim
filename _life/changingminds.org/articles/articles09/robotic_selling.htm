<h1>Robotic Selling</h1>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="../articles.htm">Guest articles</a> &gt; 
Robotic Selling</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Lee B. Salz</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="quote"><i>The sales process you are defining to grow your business may 
be the very thing that is keeping your sales team from selling.</i></p>
<p>As the economy has made sales competition fierce, companies have heavily 
focused on the sales process. Many, for the first time, are clearly defining all 
of the critical steps for their sales team. Some are even taking this to the 
level of providing detailed scripts that are to be followed to the letter by 
every sales rep. </p>
<p>It's as if they are taking all of the thought out of selling so it's like the 
robotic arms on assembly lines. Every time a sales process begins, every step is 
followed identically by the sales representative. Eureka! A sale with zero 
defects comes out the other side just like the prior ones. </p>
<p>This isn't bashing a documented process. As a matter of fact, I'm a huge 
proponent of having a defined sales process (I refer to it as a buying process, 
but that is the subject of a future article.), but I am also a firm believer in 
the importance of the personal side of selling. You've probably heard before 
that companies don't buy anything&#8230;people do. People don't like dealing with 
robots that don't think, don't care, and are inflexible. If you aren't careful, 
when you define your sales process, you could be creating an ineffective sales 
team that has adopted robotic selling. </p>
<p>Recently, I was asked to consult with a boutique travel agency. This agency 
dealt exclusively with five-figure voyages. Yet, they still faced stiff 
competition. I met with the CEO to try to ascertain what was missing as he was 
frustrated with the performance of his sales team. </p>
<p>He was puzzled to say the least. He showed me his detailed sales process, but 
the success was not there. He showed me the documented goals for the first call 
with a prospective traveler. Every sales rep on the team knew their objectives 
like the back of their hand. There were flow-charts and diagrams and training 
for the reps. Each one was tested on their proficiency of the process. Success 
is imminent, isn't it? </p>
<p>I asked the CEO to role play with me, with him as the prospective traveler 
calling in about a trip and how that call would begin. </p>
<p>&quot;Hi, I'm interested in talking with someone about a cruise that I'm thinking 
of taking&#8230;&quot; </p>
<p>The CEO responded, &quot;OK. Where were you planning to go? Did you have a 
preferred cruise line? Did you have a budget in mind for your trip?&quot; </p>
<p>I interrupted and the CEO looked perplexed. He said confidently, &quot;See, we 
have a clearly defined approach for handling a needs analysis discussion on the 
first call. We get the information we need to help our prospective clients with 
their venture. I still don't understand why our team is not more effective.&quot; </p>
<p>I asked if we could try the role play again, but flip the roles, to which the 
CEO acquiesced. </p>
<p>The CEO started&#8230; &quot;Hi, I'm interested in talking with someone about a cruise 
that I'm thinking of taking&#8230;&quot; </p>
<p>My response&#8230; &quot;How fantastic! Cruises are so much fun. The food, the music, 
the service&#8230;it's great! Have you taken one before?&quot; </p>
<p>Just like in the cartoons, a light-bulb appeared over the CEO's head. He got 
it. His process wasn't flawed and the information requested by his team during 
the needs analysis was perfectly appropriate. What was missing was the personal 
side, the personal touch. Eventually, I would have asked the needs analysis 
questions that the CEO had documented, but I guarantee that I would have 
received more information as I had developed a bond. </p>
<p>Study after study has shown that people buy based on emotion and justify 
their decision with logic. Robotic selling removes all of the emotion from the 
process making sales people ineffective. Think about the caller in this 
scenario&#8230;how excited they must be to be planning a significant vacation. They 
are looking to work with someone who shares that joy, that passion. They want to 
work with someone who they feel understands them and what they are going 
through. In the role play, the CEO quelled all of my excitement for the 
trip&#8230;like the fireman's hose putting out the fire. He was such a dud that I may 
have decided to paint my house instead of taking the trip&#8230;a total downer. </p>
<p>This change of approach with their clients had a number of benefits. Their 
prospective clients bonded more quickly with the agent and shared more 
information. The agents also cited that prospects said that they sounded 
different (positively) than other agencies. Differentiation is always a big 
winner in sales. Their success rate tripled! Interestingly, the agents said that 
now they were getting calls after the trip from their clients to share the 
experiences. And, referrals soared! </p>
<p>So, now you think this was just a cute sales tactic. Wrong! An entire 
cultural shift was needed to make the process personal. At the outset, the 
prospective traveler wanted someone to share passion. As they moved through the 
process, there were other personal needs. For example, they wanted to know that 
someone cared that their trip went exactly as it was planned. And, when things 
go wrong, which something usually will when traveling, that there is someone who 
will do everything in their power to get it right. </p>
<p>Define your sales process so you know what to do at every step, but don't 
adopt robotic selling and lose your personal touch. It's the personal touch that 
differentiates and makes people want to buy from you. </p>
<p>Need help developing a personal touch strategy for your prospect? Send me an 
email to request my buying players worksheet to help you better understand your 
buying community.<br>
