RADAR: The consultative selling tool to utilize your natural strengths</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Mark Anthony, President of Training For Success</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="quote"><i>Uncover the prospect's need while establishing trust and 
credibility. <br>
&nbsp;</i></p>
<p></p>
<p>Once you have a clear marketing and sales understanding of who your prospect 
is, how to find them, and how to get their attention, you must learn how to get 
them excited about what you have to say. This is a crucial part of the selling 
process, but it is not selling in the conventional sense of the word, because it 
isn't highlighting your product. </p>
<p>You get a prospect excited about your product by talking about them rather 
than your product. The reality is, the best way to get a prospect excited about 
your product is to develop a relationship and find out what he is looking for 
from your product. </p>
<p>This information can only be ascertained by listening to your prospect rather 
than by talking about your product. Keep in mind at all times that finding out 
what the prospect thinks is more important than talking about your product. 
Close your mouth and open your ears during a sales call and two things will 
happen: you will discover what your prospect values; and you will develop trust 
that forms the foundation of a good sales relationship. </p>
<p>Consultative selling is the number one way to close more sales. It is an 
approach that shows you have the ability to focus on the needs of others. It 
shows you listen to others, put the needs of others first, and problem solve by 
listening carefully. </p>
<p>It makes sense. What do most people care about? Themselves! Life is full of 
examples of people wanting to talk about themselves: At parties, on the job, 
when they have problems. So indulging your prospect in this not only makes them 
feel good and establishes you as someone they enjoy talking to, but it enables 
you to learn what they are looking for. Once you have developed a relationship 
and learned this, nothing can stop you. </p>
<p>So lets learn how to set ourselves apart from the competition. <br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Avoiding The #1 Sales Mistake </b> </p>
<p>The biggest mistake beginning sales people make is that they get in the door 
and are dying to tell their prospect about their product. They have so much 
product knowledge and are so eager to share it, that they forget to find out 
what is relevant to the prospect. </p>
<p>This is a mistake because you can't sell unless you understand your 
prospect's needs. You discover their needs by listening, not talking. </p>
<p>For example, you could visit four prospects who all need computers and each 
one will have different perceived needs for that computer. One brand of computer 
could, in fact, satisfy the needs of four different customers, but one pat sales 
pitch will not excite all of them. It definitely won't sell all of them. Your 
job on a sales call is to find out what each prospect is looking for. </p>
<p>If you give the same sales pitch to all four people, you'll be applying the 
fast food approach to selling. Your pitch will be satisfactory to everyone, but 
won't excite anyone! </p>
<p>This concept is similar to what you do automatically in your personal life. 
Look at how you have solved the problems of others throughout your life. You 
help people with their problems based on what you know about them and their 
objectives. The same problem for different people is handled in different ways.
</p>
<p>A reading problem with a child in school would be handled differently 
depending on whether it was caused by an issue with the teacher, a learning 
disability, or a family problem. </p>
<p>If you think about it, you'll realize that life is full of examples of 
situations in which you have been effective because you gathered pertinent 
information about an individual and their situation so that you could generate 
an appropriate or customized solution. Remember, you could not effectively solve 
the problem without trust and knowledge. The same is true for the sales arena.
</p>
<p><br>
<b>What is sales RADAR? </b> </p>
<p>We solve the #1 mistake of not listening to our prospect, and therefore not 
learning about their needs, with RADAR. RADAR© is a method for developing a 
relationship with a prospect and for finding out what your client is looking 
for. It stands for four sets of questions. </p>
<ul>
	<li>R is for rapport building questions. </li>
	<li>AD is for questions that ask about 
difficulties. </li>
	<li>The second A is asking questions for affirming understanding of 
those difficulties. </li>
	<li>R is asking questions that will tell you the results a 
person is looking for from your product. </li>
</ul>
<p>RADAR© is a simple way to take daily conversation and problem-solving 
techniques, and with a structured step-by-step system, make clients feel 
comfortable and special. To mentally prepare yourself for using RADAR© most 
effectively in a sales call, don't think of yourself as being there to sell a 
product. </p>
<p>Your main purpose is to solve your clients' needs, something which can't be 
done with a generic pitch. When you go on a sales call you already know your 
product, but you don't know your clients' needs. The key to selling is 
remembering to spend your time on a sales call finding out about these needs.
<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>RADAR© Will Give You The Skills To: </b> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Establish rapport that creates a bond between you and your prospect. 
Rapport establishes trust and enables you to find out what your prospect is 
looking for. </li>
	<li>Ascertain your prospect's needs and concerns. This is the precursor to 
telling the potential client that you can fill those needs. </li>
	<li>Ask the right questions to establish yourself as someone who understands 
your prospect's needs. This is a crucial element of convincing a prospect that 
you are someone they can trust and work with. </li>
	<li>Go beyond a prospect's initial statement of objectives and uncover what 
results they are looking for from your product. By tapping into this motivation 
you will be able to position yourself as the person to fill those needs and gain 
a powerful advantage over your competition. </li>
</ul>
<p>The following examples show RADAR© at work. Each of the people in the 
examples uses RADAR© in the interest step to set the stage for a successful 
sales call. Pay special attention in each example to the fact that reps are not 
selling, they are building relationships. </p>
<p>Notice how they warm up to the prospect, uncover their needs and develop an 
understanding of the prospects priorities. They are never pushy but always 
friendly and interested in what the prospect has to say. </p>
<h2>RADAR© Illustration #1: </h2>
<p><b>Rapport:</b> Phyllis is a widow selling glassware to buyers for department stores 
in major malls. She is a successful sales representative and is getting her 
chance to try to crack what would be a lucrative account with a buyer that no 
one in the company has been able to crack. </p>
<p>Phyllis used RADAR: During the first step of RADAR, Phyllis establishes 
rapport with the buyer by asking questions that allow her to learn about her 
prospect: How long have you been with this particular department store?; What 
brought you to New York?; How do you like the city?; How did you get into 
retailing? </p>
<p>It's at this point that the buyer reveals that she got into retailing because 
she was widowed. Phyllis is also widowed and as they discuss that common ground, 
rapport is instantly established. Rapport building establishes trust and creates 
a bond between prospect and sales representative. It breaks down the barriers 
that are present in any sales situation. </p>
<p><b>Difficulty: </b>Once Phyllis feels she has established rapport with the buyer, 
she begins asking the difficulty questions: </p>
<ul>
	<li>What's been your biggest 
difficulty being a widow in business?; </li>
	<li>What problems have been coming up for 
you in your job?; </li>
	<li>With all that's going on in your life, what could I do as a 
sales representative to makes things easier on you?; </li>
	<li>What problems have you 
had with vendors? </li>
</ul>
<p>What the buyer told Phyllis was that having someone to tie up details like 
calling her when the delivery comes in and taking care of paperwork would make 
her job easier. She said she would be thrilled if Phyllis would prepare all the 
paperwork on each order for signature so she wouldn't have to bother with it. 
She said she would also feel better if Phyllis would handle credits on any 
broken merchandise so she wouldn't have to bother with it. </p>
<p><b>Purpose: </b>The reason you ask difficulty questions is that they teach you what 
is valuable to your prospect besides price. Keep in mind that offering good 
service is not enough. You must state your offer in a way that fills the need 
that your prospect has expressed. When you can position yourself as someone who 
is serving the specific need expressed by the prospect, you become much more 
essential to the prospect. In the case of Phyllis, the issue of service is not 
nearly as important as the fact that she could handle the details of delivery 
updates and eliminate tedious paperwork. By presenting the benefit of great 
service in the exact way the buyer defines service, Phyllis dramatically 
increases her chances of getting the sale. </p>
<p><b>Affirmation: </b>For affirmation Phyllis says: &quot;So if I understand you correctly, 
what you need from me as a rep is to totally cover all aspects of sales, 
including order taking, overseeing delivery and preparing all paper-work for 
signature.&quot; </p>
<p><b>Purpose: </b>Phyllis makes the buyer feel comfortable working with her because 
Phyllis demonstrates that she is someone who understands her and offers the 
services that are important to her. </p>
<p><b>Results: </b>Once she has affirmed to the buyer that she understands what she 
needs, Phyllis wants to get to the next level and understand what motivates the 
buyer to want these details handled. The question here is: What would be the 
major benefit to you if I did all these things for you? </p>
<p>The buyer tells Phyllis if she could handle paperwork and the buyer could 
deal only with Phyllis, she would no longer have the aggravation of wasting time 
onpaperwork. She said she wants to stop having to worry that all the details 
won't be taken care of. This would ultimately lead to stress reduction and job 
security. </p>
<p><b>Purpose: </b>What Phyllis finds out is that the buyer wants her life to be more 
simplified, her stress reduced, and her job security enhanced. By knowing this, 
she knows what motivates the buyer. </p>
<p>This example illustrates how Phyllis is selling much more than glassware, and 
that glassware is only part of what the buyer is looking for. It also shows how 
Phyllis can use her innate traits to ascertain this information. </p>
<p>Rapport questions established the trust; asking difficulty questions 
uncovered the prospect's concerns; the affirmation question established 
confidence and trust in Phyllis and showed that she listened and understood what 
the prospect really needed; the results question allowed Phyllis to learn that 
the buyer's real motive in working with her is stress reduction and being freed 
from paperwork. </p>
<p>The reason RADAR© is essential is that in a sales situation there will be 
many other reps competing with you on price and style. You have to get the sale 
by establishing a relationship and showing the prospect you are the 
representative who really understands their needs. </p>
<h2>RADAR© Illustration #2 </h2>
<p>Terry sells mailing lists and he is selling to a man who buys lists for his 
catalog company. Terry needs to be able to set himself apart from the other 
representatives who have banks of names to sell. What he needs is to make 
himself become the product, because almost the exact same lists he sells can be 
purchased from any number of people. </p>
<p><b>Rapport: </b>When Terry goes into the buyer's office he notices the prospect's 
watch. He admires the watch and asks what the '300' on the face stands for? What 
he finds out is that the man bowled three perfect games. This accomplishment is 
something he is very proud of and is very comfortable sharing with Terry. In 
fact, he talks for ten or fifteen minutes about it, after which he feels very at 
ease with Terry. A bond has been established. </p>
<p>Terry used rapport building effectively because he noticed specifics that the 
average person wouldn't have picked up on. He utilizes his listening skills to 
show genuine interest in what the prospect was saying. His sincere interest in 
the prospect makes him much more likable than competing salespeople. </p>
<p><b>Purpose: </b>The rapport building made the prospect comfortable and made him feel 
that Terry is someone he likes and can relate to. Even more important, he has 
evidence that Terry listens and has a real interest in what is important to the 
prospect. </p>
<p><b>Difficulty: </b>For difficulty questions Terry asks: What is the biggest 
difficulty in selling your product to lawyers?; What is the hardest part of 
getting your product in front of lawyers?; How does your competition try to 
reach this market?; What makes you better than the competition?; Why don't you 
think the lawyers know that? </p>
<p>Because of rapport building, this prospect is already in the habit of opening 
up to Terry, and he's happy to listen and learn. </p>
<p><b>Purpose: </b>In the process of answering these questions the prospect is telling 
Terry which business issues are his main concern. The questions allow the 
prospect to see his own problem, which allows him to be smart in coming up with 
the solution. He also sees the importance of Terry's service and the need for 
him to be there. </p>
<p><b>Affirmation:</b> To make sure he's in synch with what the prospect is saying, 
Terry uses affirmation questions. They include: If I understand you correctly, 
you need lawyers to see the benefits of your product even though you don't have 
the powerful marketing budget of your competitors, is that right? </p>
<p><b>Purpose: </b>The affirmation proves to the prospect that he and Terry are in 
synch. </p>
<p><b>Results: </b>Next, Terry asks the prospect what results he envisions for his 
company if each lawyer in the area saw a comparison of his product versus the 
competition. The prospect answers that he's sure his market share would increase 
dramatically and that's exactly what he needs. </p>
<p><b>Purpose: </b>Terry finds out that he's motivated by increased market share, not 
just the best price on a mailing list. Terry can then focus on the results 
generated from his product's quality and reputation, rather than focusing on the 
price issue. </p>
<h2>RADAR© Illustration #3 </h2>
<p>Monica is a representative who sells financial products and in her first year 
made the $1,000,000 round-table and has remained a member ever since. She uses 
RADAR© very successfully and on a recent sales call Monica met with Gary, a 
successful advertising executive who is in his late twenties, single and really 
on the move with his career. Normally someone like Gary would be a hard sale for 
life insurance. </p>
<p>The first thing Monica did was ask questions such as: &quot;What a great photo of 
you on skis; do you ski often? Where do you usually ski and what is your 
favorite place for skiing?&quot; </p>
<p>Through these questions, Monica learned that Gary loves the active lifestyle, 
that he loves to get a ski house every winter and that he wants escape weekends 
to be part of his lifestyle forever, not just his youth. Since she also 
appreciates skiing, she quickly established the bond of being a young, active 
professional who appreciates both working hard and playing hard. </p>
<p>She moved into asking about difficulty questions with the statement, &quot;Saving 
is hard with our active lifestyle.&quot; Gary agreed, and then she asked him what 
type of structured savings plan he currently followed? What's been your biggest 
problem saving consistently? What is your biggest concern with investments? Can 
you tell me about any difficulties you have encountered with past investment 
experiences? </p>
<p>From these questions she learned he often spends money needlessly and could 
easily put more aside, and that although his ability to follow a plan has 
yielded a great reward in business, he admitted he has been negligent in 
applying the same amount of discipline in his financial future. </p>
<p>Monica then asked: &quot;If I understand you correctly, you appreciate the 
importance of a plan?&quot; Gary admitted this was true and even gave some weak 
excuses why he wasn't following a plan, even though he knew it was important.
</p>
<p>Now, rather than jumping on this opportunity to sell Gary a financial plan or 
life insurance, she held off, knowing from Gary's answer and her experience that 
this type of prospect does not see the urgency of an insurance plan while single 
and feeling they will always be healthy and making more money. </p>
<p>So she asked: &quot;If you could be handed $250,000 in 20 years, where would you 
build a ski house? If I could guarantee the result of saving money when you're 
married, plus have a dream ski house in 20 years, all without changing your 
spending patterns, how would this be for you?&quot; </p>
<p>As Gary described the ski house and fun with his future family, he was 
convincing himself of why this might be the right time to invest in life 
insurance. </p>
<p>Monica now has all the info and knowledge about Gary's motivations to create 
a sale. The foundation is set for the sale. It is now up to her to present facts 
and benefits about her products and services to show Gary how his dreams will be 
moving in the right direction by working with Monica. After learning about her 
prospect's needs, Monica can present her product in a way that gets Gary to see 
himself benefiting by doing business with Monica now. </p>
<h2>Why RADAR© Works </h2>
<p>It's the sincere genuine interest that makes rapport building effective. That 
is where the top producers set themselves apart. Remember, all things being 
equal, people do business with friends and people they like. Even when products 
and services are not equal, business is still more often done with people who 
are pleasant to deal with. </p>
<h2>Personalizing RADAR© to your own presentation</h2>
<p>Following is a list of sample 
questions to give you the tools to start using RADAR© immediately. Obviously 
these questions should be shaped to fit your personal style and the situation 
you are selling in, but use them as a structure within which to work. Notice how 
these sample questions uncover the type of information that a sales rep needs.
</p>
<h3>Sample Rapport Building Questions: </h3>
<p>Rapport is the foundation for RADAR© and the precursor to the rest of the 
selling steps. Rapport building questions get people talking to you. When they 
talk to you about little things they are comfortable in sharing, they'll begin 
to feel safe and secure with you, which will help them share bigger things, such 
as what they need from your product, and what their ultimate goal is. </p>
<p>Rapport building questions establish trust and friendship. This friendship 
breaks down the defensive wall that naturally exists between prospect and 
salesperson when they first meet. Here are some sample rapport building 
questions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>How long have you been in business?</li>
	<li>What made you choose this 
area for your business?</li>
	<li>How did you get in to this line of work?</li>
	<li>What made 
you decide to go into your own business?</li>
	<li>I see you're active with your local 
scout troop. What is your involvement?</li>
	<li>That piece of artwork is exquisite, for 
how long have you been painting/collecting?</li>
	<li>I like the background music at 
your restaurant. How do you find such good CDs?</li>
	<li>Based on your accent, you're 
not from the US. What brought you to America? </li>
</ul>
<h3>Sample Difficulty Questions: </h3>
<p>Your job as a salesperson is to solve your prospect's problems and satisfy 
their needs. To do this you must know what your prospect's problems and needs 
are and make them realize the urgency of their concerns. Although each of your 
clients may have similar needs, you will not know the specifics of each client's 
situation and their perception of their most pressing need unless you ask about 
their difficulties and problems. </p>
<p>It's crucial to ask a prospect to describe difficulties to you, in their own 
words. You may assume you understand his problems, but you may be assuming 
incorrectly. Only by allowing the prospect to express difficulties himself can 
you find out exactly what he needs fixed. </p>
<p>Difficulty Questions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>What are your biggest difficulties with delivery?</li>
	<li>When it comes to vendors, what are your biggest difficulties?</li>
	<li>&nbsp;&#8226;; What are your 
greatest concerns about the competition?</li>
	<li>Why do you feel ___________ is your 
greatest competition?</li>
	<li>What is the most important benefit you offer your 
customers?</li>
	<li>What makes you different from the competition?</li>
	<li>What is the 
greatest challenge in getting customers to appreciate all you offer?</li>
	<li>What is 
the biggest problem you had with a supplier?</li>
	<li>Tell me about the biggest 
difficulty you are currently facing? </li>
</ul>
<h3>Sample Affirmation Questions: </h3>
<p>The purpose of affirmation questions are twofold: They allow you to check if 
you are understanding what a prospect has said to you; and they allow you to 
notify the person you are talking to that they are being understood. Affirmation 
questions are essential because the potential for misunderstanding someone in 
communication is so great. Only by accurately ascertaining what your client 
needs can you effectively sell to them. </p>
<p>Also, remember that every business person is yessed nearly to death by 
employees, contractors and salespeople who do things incorrectly after they 
claimed to understand instructions. If you let a prospect know that they are 
talking to someone who understands them, they will want to work with you. </p>
<p>Not only will affirmation questions allow you to do your job right the first 
time, they will strengthen the bond between you and your prospect as they think 
to themselves, &quot;This person understands me.&quot; Also note that these questions get 
the prospect to say yes to their needs.</p>
<ul>
	<li>If I understand you correctly, what 
you are saying is ___________________?</li>
	<li>So your main concerns is 
___________________ isn't it?</li>
	<li>The main problem you need to solve is 
___________________, is that right?</li>
	<li>If I could solve ___________________, 
would that give you what you need?</li>
	<li>Isn't what you want me to give you 
___________________? </li>
</ul>
<h3>Sample Results Questions: </h3>
<p>Results questions are the most difficult. People are reluctant to tell you 
their innermost reasons for what they want. Sometimes they don't even know 
themselves. You really have to probe and listen carefully &quot;. </p>
<p>Phyllis was able to listen closely and uncover that the glassware buyer 
wanted stress reduction in her life. Terry had to uncover that his prospect 
wanted to gain market share. </p>

<ul>
	<li>What would it mean to you if (main need) was fulfilled?</li>

<h3>Avoiding The 5 RADAR© Obstacles: </h3>
<ol>
	<li>When people find that RADAR© doesn't work, they are usually asking yes or 
no questions. RADAR© questions must be open-ended. If you must ask a yes or no 
question such as, &quot;Is that your wife in that picture,&quot; follow up with a question 
such as &quot;Where did you meet her.&quot; </li>
	<li>Don't be afraid to ask questions. If a prospect hurries you, it's usually 
not worth doing the sales presentation. If you're being rushed, try this 
response. Say, &quot;I need to know my clients so I can serve them effectively. If I 
can't ask you a few questions, I won't be able to serve you effectively.&quot; 
	</li>
	<li>When you begin your dialogue of asking RADAR© questions tell prospects 
you'd like to ask them a few questions and save time by determining if your 
services are appropriate for them. By doing this you are offering the prospect 
two possible benefits, saving time and putting them at ease by possibly not 
having to buy from you. </li>
	<li>People like to feel that they don't have to buy from you, but what happens 
in the course of the sales call is that they answer your questions and tell you 
why they need you. The key is, they still feel as though they're in control. The 
perfect phrase is: &quot;To save you time and see if my ideas/product is even 
appropriate for you, do you mind if I ask you a few questions?&quot; </li>
	<li>The fifth and most deadly sales sin regarding RADAR© is not using it. Reps 
who are over-confident in their presentation and understanding of the prospect's 
needs go right into talking about what they have to offer rather then getting 
the prospect clearly tuned into why both parties are meeting, which is to help 
one another. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Summary </h2>
<p>RADAR© is not used to sell your product. Notice in all of the examples in 
this chapter the reps were not selling - they were finding out what their 
prospects were looking for. You MUST learn the needs of your prospect before you 
can position your product to solve them. </p>
<p>If you use RADAR© and do what Phyllis, Terry and Monica did you will be 
exceptionally effective. Most salespeople don't delve deeply enough into their 
prospect's specific needs to find out what it means to have those needs 
satisfied. </p>
<p>A salesperson makes a sale when he goes beyond a prospect's statement of &quot;I 
want more business&quot; to find out that the prospect really wants a chance to 
expand their stores or fight off competition. </p>
<p>So relax, talk to your prospect, and don't be afraid to ask questions. 
Conversation is your greatest sales tool, and remember you have the natural 
skills for the greatest sales tool. You have the natural skills for RADAR©. </p>
