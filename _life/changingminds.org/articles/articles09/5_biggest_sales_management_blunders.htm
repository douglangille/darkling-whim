The 5 Biggest Sales Management Coaching Blunders</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Steven Rosen, MBA</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="quote"><i>Sales coaching is the management No. 1 activity that drives sales 
performance. The only problem is that managers have not been taught how to 
effectively coach. Coaching is a skill that takes time to perfect and unless 
effectively coached or trained managers make all types of blunders. </i> </p>
<h2>Do You Want To Increase Sales Performance? </h2>
<p>Transforming your sales managers from good to great coaches can have a 
dramatic impact on sales. In fact, sales coaching is the management No. 1 
activity that drives sales performance. The only problem is that managers have 
not been taught how to effectively coach. Coaching is a skill that takes time to 
perfect and unless effectively coached or trained managers make all types of 
blunders. </p>
<p>As the head of sales or as a frontline sales manager you can greatly enhance 
the performance of your sales team if you can develop great coaches. </p>
<h2>Coaching Blunder #1 &#8211; &#8220;Telling vs. Asking Coaching&#8221; </h2>
<p>As a sales manager you probably were a top sales rep. You may still see 
yourself as a problem-solver, like &#8220;If I solve this rep&#8217;s issue then she/he can 
make the sale.&#8221; As a result of your action orientation you are likely to tell 
the salesperson how to solve the issue. &#8220;Telling&#8221; does not create self-managing 
salespeople. In fact, there are numerous downsides to the tell-first approach.
</p>
<p>First, you are not empowering your sales reps, who may perceive you as being 
a micro manager. Second, you are also creating a dependency on you to be their 
problem-solver. This creates endless emails, phone calls and resulting in needy 
reps. And third, you are not developing them. One of the critical areas for 
development is the ability to be a self manager. </p>
<p>Be aware of when you are in &#8220;tell&#8221; mode and remind yourself, when you have 
fallen into a bad habit. </p>
<h2>Coaching Blunder #2 &#8211; &#8220;I&#8217;ll get to it Coaching&#8221; 
</h2>
<p>Time management is a challenge we all face. With emails, meetings and 
administrative work what is a sales manager to do? If sales results are what you 
desire then the easy answer is to do the activities that will drive the greatest 
revenue. Generally we do the busy work first as they are the easiest to. It 
feels good when we are up to date on our emails. The stress is reduced when we 
have all our reports in on time and we have followed up on all our messages. </p>
<p>But all those activities don&#8217;t contribute to the bottom line. If great sales 
coaching can have a direct impact of up to 19% more sales, why is coaching not 
the #1 priority? </p>
<p>Stop making excuses and get out of the office. Get out in the field and make 
coaching your #1 priority. Your boss will thank you and your reps will make lots 
of money. </p>
<p>Sales&#8217; coaching is the No. 1 management activity that drives sales 
performance. The only problem is that managers have not been taught how to 
effectively coach. Coaching is a skill that takes time to perfect and unless 
effectively coached or trained managers make all types of mistakes. This is the 
3rd in a series of coaching pitfalls that mangers should avoid. </p>
<h2>Coaching Blunder #3 &#8220;Laundry List Coaching&#8221; </h2>
<p>Personal growth and change is a challenge for all of us. We all have 
strengths and areas for development. Mangers who decide who create a laundry 
list of areas for development will have little success. It is too difficult for 
sales rep to make wholesale changes in how they sell. Development is about 
working on improving 1 or 2 things and once the sales person has demonstrated 
that they have acquired the skill or behaviour then you can move on to the next 
area. </p>
<p>From a sales reps perspective imagine getting a field report listing all of 
the things you do wrong? Some reps would not even read the report. Many will 
read and wonder where I start. Others may read it and be completely overwhelmed.
</p>
<p>Great coaching is about focus focus and focus. Helping a sales rep improve in 
one area of their job can have a major impact on their performance. </p>
<h2>Coaching Blunder #4 &#8220;One Size Fits All Coaching&#8221; </h2>
<p>One of the key pitfalls sales managers fall into is when the take the &#8220;one 
size fits all approach&#8221;. </p>
<p>How many times have we witnessed a sales rep working in auto pilot? This is 
the rep doing the same sales pitch to each customer and delivering the message 
in the same way. As coaches we fail to see when we go into auto pilot, taking 
the same approach with each rep. </p>
<p>Do you ever find yourself coaching all your reps the same way? Your feedback 
to each rep is the same? You have fallen into the rut of one size fits all 
coaching. Coaching differs from training. Training is about having everyone 
learn the same information or skills. Coaching on the other hand is about 
diagnosing each reps particular area for improvement. It is about adapting your 
coaching style to the individual and about developing individualised development 
plans. </p>
<p>Coaching is a one to one sport. It is about growing individuals to develop to 
their full potential. </p>
<h2>Coaching Blunder #5 &#8211; &quot;Way to go Coaching&#8221; </h2>
<p>One of the key blunders managers make is not getting a commitment to change. 
They have done a perfect job coaching by asking all right questions, come to 
agreement on areas for development but forget to get buy in on how the problem 
will be fixed. When the manger and rep agree on an area for development it is 
critical to have the rep buy in to what steps they will take to develop. </p>
<p>This requires a simple 3 or 4 point plan which includes what the sales rep 
will do between coaching sessions. The key is to have the rep develop their own 
next steps and your role becomes one of holding them accountable. Without this 
in place the odds are that there will be no change in rep behaviour or skills on 
the next coaching session. </p>
<p>Great coaching means great performance. Sales organizations that embrace a 
coaching culture and invest in their front line managers&#8217; ability to coach will 
have a competitive advantage and outsell the competition. </p>
