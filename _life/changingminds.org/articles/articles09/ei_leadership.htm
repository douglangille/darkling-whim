Leadership vs. Situational Leadership</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Michael Allison</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
No company will successfully develop its future leaders nor become great by 
simply sending its top prospects on a two or three-day leadership training 
program. <p>
The above sentence seems to be self-evident common sense, right? Yet, a lot of 
companies here in China are doing exactly that. They spend tens of thousands of 
RMB to send their top managers on expensive leadership training programs, that 
in some cases, have nothing to do with actual leadership. <p>
Let's be clear on what leadership is. <p>
Leadership is the art of motivating and inspiring a group of people to work 
towards the accomplishment of a common goal and helping them to clearly see the 
personal rewards they will obtain when the goal is attained. <p>
I know at the outset that this article is going to upset a lot of people, since 
my purpose in writing it is to draw a clear line in the sand between two 
completely different types of leadership training solutions in the Chinese 
training market. <p>
The first type of solution is what I have referred to in the first sentence, the 
two or three-day training program, of which there are many in China. One of the 
most popular, if not the most popular, is &quot;Situational Leadership.&quot;<p>
The second type of solution I am going to elucidate on is not a training 
program, but instead it is a process. Of course this process involves training, 
but it goes far beyond having staff attend a two or three-day seminar, return to 
work with a bunch of templates that show them how they should evaluate their 
team members in terms of development level and adjust their leadership style to 
the employee's level. <p>
The process I am referring to takes much longer, perhaps a year or two or more, 
it requires the commitment of the top management in the organization, and its 
ultimate outcome is establishing a culture of leadership and learning within the 
organization. In short, you will have an organization where everyone, regardless 
of their role, will be continually developing and using leadership skills on a 
daily basis and they will be having a lot of fun doing so.<p>
Let me start with a look at the &quot;Situational Leadership&quot; model, developed by 
Hersey &amp; Blanchard. Their model provides four levels of development. <p>
<b>D1 - Low Competence, High Commitment</b> - in general these individuals are 
lacking the specific skills for the job at hand, but have the confidence and/or 
motivation to take it on. <p>
<b>D2 - Some Competence, Low Commitment</b> - have some relevant skills, but 
still need assistance to do the job. Task or situation may be new to this 
person.<p>
<b>D3 - High Competence, Variable Commitment </b>- experienced and capable, but 
may lack confidence to get job done on own, or may lack motivation to do job 
well or quickly<p>
<b>D4 - High Competence, High Commitment </b>- experienced and comfortable in 
own ability to get job done. This person may even be more skilled than the 
leader. <p>
Then there are four leadership styles to be used depending on how the leader 
assesses the developmental level of the employee.<p>
<b>S1 - Telling/Directing </b>- focuses on tasks as opposed to relationships. 
Communication is basically one-way, as leader makes decisions and announces 
them. Leaders define roles and tasks of the followers and closely supervises 
them. <p>
<b>S2 - Selling/Coaching </b>- both high task &amp; high relationship focus. More 
two-way communication - follower still needs direction, as she/he lacks 
experience and some commitment. However, leader seeks ideas &amp; suggestions from 
follower, while still retaining the prerogative to make decisions. <p>
<b>S3 - Participating/Supporting </b>- Low task, high relationship focus. 
Control is with follower, leader passes daily decisions, such as task processes 
and allocation to her/him. For individuals with competence but lacking in 
motivation or confidence. She/he needs less direction because of skills, but 
still needs leader to boost her/his confidence or motivation level.<p>
<b>S4 - Delegating - Control with follower </b>- low task and low relationship 
focus. This is for people who have high competence and high 
confidence/motivation level. Need very little to no supervision and support when 
working on tasks or projects. Follower decides when leader needs to be involved.<p>
Hersey and Blanchard have said that the leadership style should correspond to 
the developmental level of the follower and the leader is the one to do the 
adapting. Therefore, a D1 requires the leader to use S1. <p>
<b>The steps in the Situational Leadership process are as follows: </b>
<ol>
	<li>Make an overview per employee of her/his tasks</li>
	<li>Assess employee on each task (D1&#8230;D4)</li>
	<li>Decide on the leadership style per task (S1&#8230;S4)</li>
	<li>Discuss the situation with the employee</li>
	<li>Make a joint plan</li>
	<li>Follow-up, check and correct</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
<b>The strengths of the Situational Leadership Model are: </b>
	<ul>
		<li>Easy to understand </li>
		<li>Easy to use</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
The limitations and disadvantages of the Situational Leadership model are: 
		<ul>
			<li>Fails to distinguish between leadership &amp; management. In fact, 
			what is called leadership style is really a management style for 
			handling people in differing situations.<br>
			Situational Leadership focuses on making decisions, whereas 
			leadership is primarily about inspiring and motivating people to 
			change direction - not about making decisions.</li>
			<li>First, leaders decide there is a need for change and then they 
			may vary the way they inspire or motivate people to buy-in to the 
			need for change. Therefore, the leadership style does not reduce to 
			decision making style, which is what Situational Leadership is 
			about.</li>
			<li>The Situational Leadership model focuses far too much on what 
			the person in charge does.</li>
			<li>There is nothing profound in this model in terms of our basic 
			understanding of what it means to lead or manage. The fact that 
			leaders and managers need to behave differently in different 
			situations is a common-sense approach to life. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
In short - and this is the main thing to remember - <b>Situational Leadership is 
not really about leadership</b>. It is about how to handle people in differing 
situations. Of course it has its merits, but it is not possible to build a 
culture of leadership and learning in your organization by putting managers 
through a two or three-day Situational Leadership seminar. It will not help your 
organization become a great organization.<p>
Building an organization where leadership is a part of the very culture requires 
much more. It is a process that takes commitment and time. It is not a program 
that people can be put through in two or three days. However, for your 
organization to be truly great, there is no other way. <p>
For starters, the top management must see the need for and the positive benefits 
that result from building this type of organization. Top management must be able 
to visualize how great their company can be by instilling this type of culture 
in their organization. <p>
Once top management is committed, what steps need to be taken? The following: 
			<ol>
				<li>Dynamic Inquiry - This part of the process involves having &quot;real&quot; 
conversations with groups of employees to find out how they truly feel about 
themselves, their teams, team leaders, and teammates. How is the organization 
				helping or hindering them in fulfilling their roles, 
				accomplishing their tasks, and achieving their personal goals? 
				How do employees describe the climate at work and within the 
				company/organization in general? Dynamic Inquiry requires that 
				leaders be willing to listen with empathy to what their 
				followers have to say, and acknowledge their true feelings. This 
				requires a real openness and a degree of vulnerability on the 
				part of leaders.<br>
				The Dynamic Inquiry process takes some time to complete, but 
				when done it results in a clear picture of the Emotional Reality 
				of an organization. Furthermore, because everyone has shared in 
				the process, it also helps to foster a spirit of mutual 
				ownership and cooperation on the part of employees to commit to 
				improving the organization and building a culture of leadership. 
				</li>
				<li>Determine the Ideal - Ideally, what should the organization be like? How 
should it feel to work in an organization where there is a culture of leadership 
and learning and where there is a high level of EI on the part of all, from the 
top management down? Again, in determining this, everyone in the organization 
can have a share in thinking about and describing what the ideal should look, 
sound, and feel like. Once this has been determined and communicated to all, 
then we can get down to the task of implementing the systems and processes to 
achieve this ideal. </li>
				<li>Implement Process and Systems - Let's start with training. Running an EI 
Leadership workshop for top managers and middle managers would be the first 
logical step. They are trained in the four EI competencies - Self-Awareness, 
				Self Management, Social Awareness, and Relationship Management.<br>
				They also receive training in the Five Discoveries, a 
				self-directed learning process that involves constructing a 
				learning agenda with the purpose of closing the gaps between the 
				image of what one wishes to be and the reality. <br>
				This process can then be passed on from the management to the 
				staff members. When top management is enthusiastic about the 
				process it has a powerful motivating effect on everyone else, 
				and the process of developing an emotionally intelligent 
				organization will be successful. <br>
Additionally, systems are put into place to foster the EI Leadership culture. 
For example, the HR Department can screen potential new recruits based on their 
EI. 360° feedback, performance management, opportunities for promotion, and 
raises can all be based, at least in part, on how individuals are doing in 
displaying the EI skills.<br>
Even teams and entire departments can be assessed based on the EI competencies 
				in order to help them make continuous improvement. We all know 
				that groups of people have moods and needs. They act 
				collectively, and one of the jobs of a leader is to read the 
				emotions of the group and then work to inspire and motivate the 
				individuals and group as a whole to drive change. <br>
				As I mentioned already, this process takes real commitment and 
				time. However, the companies and organizations that make this 
				commitment reap a multitude of benefits. For instance, they have 
				much higher retention rates because employees are motivated, 
				inspired, valued, and respected.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
The climate in such organizations is one of empathy, empowerment, initiative, 
accomplishment, and fun. People working in organizations that have used the EI 
Leadership process to cultivate a culture of leadership and learning truly enjoy 
going to work each day.<p>
The bottom line also benefits. There is plenty of research to show that 
companies that have cultivated a culture of EI leadership and learning are much 
more profitable than companies that have not done so. <p>
We live in a world where change is constant. Companies and organizations must 
have a culture of leadership and learning in order to be successful in 
implementing the changes necessary to thrive. Investing the time in building an 
emotionally intelligent organization is key to such success. <p>
