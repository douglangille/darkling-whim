Stress is like living in an ambulance</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Ronit Baras</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stress is defined as a reaction to a threat, emotional or physical, real or 
imaginary. Most people in the world are stressed at some stage. Most people in 
the world feel threatened from time to time. </p><p>
Stress is a feeling of pressure that produces adrenalin and creates a sense of 
urgency. Stress is exhausting and limits our ability to respond. There are so 
many physical symptoms linked to stress that some theories suggest most of 
humanity's problems are caused by stress. Some of the symptoms are irritability, 
inability to focus, headaches, increased heart rate, muscle tension, insomnia 
(inability to sleep), confusion, high blood pressure, frequent illness and 
various types of pain. </p><p>
Living in stress is like living in an ambulance all your life. You are on the 
road most of the day, you live in a small space, not many people around, 
everything is difficult, your decisions are all about life and death, mistakes 
are critical, there is no time to waste, not time for fun, not enough time and 
space to make your own meals, you see (too) many doctors, you develop a dark 
view of the world from frequent exposure to accidents, drink driving, violence 
and self neglect. Through the eyes of the stressed person life sucks! </p><p>
There are many reasons for people to feel stressed. Often, it is the 
accumulation of more than one source of stress that creates enough pressure to 
exhaust people. </p><p>
Historically, body's mechanism to handle a real threat was the &quot;fight or flight&quot; 
response, which would a massive surge of energy for a short period of time. 
However, when this mechanism is triggered too often, our body runs out of 
energy. </p><p>
Unfortunately, over the years, people started to react strongly to frequent, 
minor triggers. Something that someone says to us can be a threat, something 
that does not happen the way we expect can be a threat, but those things build 
up until our response to them is similar to &quot;fight or flight&quot;. </p><p>
Even more unfortunately, this trend is only increasing. </p><p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<i>What can cause stress?</i></p><h3>
Poor diet</h3><p>
Unfortunately, when stressed, people tend to eat things that interfere with the 
absorption of nutrients. Lack of vitamins and minerals can cause stress, 
creating a vicious cycle - you are stressed, therefore you do not eat well, but 
then your body lacks nutrients and you become more stressed&#8230; </p><p>
In this case, it is important in stressful situations to stick to healthy 
eating. Have an emergency plan for emergency situations and stick to it. If you 
are stressed, ask yourself &quot;What do I need to eat to give my body enough 
nutrients for me to relax?&quot; </p><h3>
Change </h3><p>
Most people find it hard to deal with change. Even planned changes like moving 
to a new job or moving to a new house create a sense of pressure, mainly 
because of the fear of the unknown. If you think about it, the unknown is there 
all the time, in every second of our life and in order to survive it, we need to 
stick to controlling what we can. I can control what I do during the move, I can 
control my actions and behaviors and I can choose a house to suit my needs. </p><p>
Unplanned changes, like accidents, death, illness or crisis create stress ever 
more, because of the sudden loss of certainty. </p><p class="quote">
<i>The only thing constant in life is change </i>- François de la Rochefoucauld </p><p>
It is important to understand that we are changing all the time and that change 
and growth go hand in hand. Preparing well to planned changes will help you deal 
with unplanned changes. In a strange way, you can also be certain that unplanned 
changes will occur and when they do, your certainty can increase. </p><h3>
No money </h3><p>
Most of the people in the world live a lifestyle that is hard to maintain. 
Although education is perceived to be free in many countries, children actually 
cost their parents lots of money. In many places around the world, people do not 
have enough money for food (have you seen the movie &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot;?). If 
you ask people about the causes of stress (called &quot;stressors&quot;), you will find 
that lack of money is at the top of the list, causing them many sleepless 
nights. </p><p>
Stress regarding money increases during crisis, so the best way to avoid it is 
to manage your money wisely. Live within your means and always put some extra 
money for a rainy day. </p><h3>
No time </h3><p>
Lack of time is a growing source of stress in our society. Most people work many 
hours, long days and do not have time to do all the things they want or have to 
do. Others are just &quot;time wasters&quot; and are not efficient in their time 
management. Yet, we all have 24 hours a day and we can manage our time, rather 
than letting our time manage us. Here are some symptoms of time wasters: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Being disorganized </li>
  <li>Not knowing how to say &quot;no&quot; </li>
  <li>Planning to do too much for the time allocated </li>
  <li>Not taking time to rejuvenate </li>
  <li>Watching too much TV (this includes YouTube, idle Net surfing and playing video 
games) </li>
  <li>Inability to delegate properly </li>
  <li>Procrastinating </li>
  <li>Not having good systems </li>
  <li>Having too much clutter and a messy home/desk/shed/office </li>
  <li>Avoiding helpful technology </li>
  <li>Being easily distracted and allowing interruptions </li>
</ul>
<p>
The way to solve the time management issue is to build your time management 
skills and understand that the difference between being stressed and relaxed is 
the way you manage your time. Develop techniques and ways to handle your time 
when you are relaxed. It will help you greatly when you are not. </p><h3>
Relationships </h3><p>
Many people feel pressured regarding their relationships with their boss, 
partners, friends, parents, in laws, kids, employees, clients, etc. Most of the 
time, the pressure builds when there is a verbal or non-verbal expectation to 
behave differently. </p><p>
The solution to pressure from others is confidence! Personal development is a 
way of building confidence. You learn about yourself, your desires, your mind 
and your attitude and you learn to design your life to your advantage. </p><h3>
Inability to switch off </h3><p>
Many people, when feeling stressed, are unable to switch off from working, 
thinking, taking care of others or any other thing that occupies all of their 
being. Many times, this can cause insomnia and inability to relax. It is like 
riding in an ambulance with the siren on all the time. Remember, even an 
ambulance needs to stop to refuel and recharge. This inability to switch off 
does not allow people to enjoy coming home from a full day at work or enjoy a 
holiday they have worked hard to pay for. </p><p>
Find out how many hours of sleep you need and stick to them. During stressful 
times, sleep even more, because stress is exhausting. Do not bring work home (if 
you have to, do it only after your kids are in bed). On holidays, turn your 
mobile phone (and every other beeping and vibrating device your own) off and 
avoid checking your emails. During a work day, stop every hour for a stretch, go 
to the toilet, talk to someone and drink some water. This will help you recharge 
and function better. </p><h3>
Indecision </h3><p>
Just like the urgency in making decisions in an ambulance, some people find it 
hard to make decisions. Deciding what house to buy and what dinner to cook can 
create the same feeling of stress sometimes. In a way, not making a decision is 
a decision in itself and people fall into the trap of waiting for divine 
intervention or circumstances that to make the choice for them, but this only 
increases their insecurity and makes it harder for them to make new decisions.
</p><p>
The way to handle this challenge is to remember that we are not fortune tellers 
and at any given time, we do the best we can. Also, we are rarely faced with 
life or death situations. Spaghetti or rice? Who cares? Bring it on! </p><h3>
Lack of significance </h3><p>
Some people are so insecure they depend on others to feel appreciated and happy. 
The need for others to fill their significance tank creates lots of stress, 
disappointment and later anger. Those people usually feel unheard, unappreciated 
and spend a lot of effort pleasing others to gain some acknowledgment, but this 
is a vicious cycle, because it increases the feeling of dependency and requires 
more appreciation from others later on. </p><p>
The way to handle such stress is to learn self appreciation, self love and 
develop self confidence. There is always something good you can find in yourself 
- your smile, your manners, your sense of humor, some achievement at work, a 
good intention, a kind deed. Seek and ye shall find. </p><h3>
Use of drugs </h3><p>
Use of drugs comes with some physical comfort, followed by some form of panic 
when the drug wears off. The dependency creates lots of pressure, the need for 
money creates pressure and sometimes the need to hide the use creates a lot of 
pressure . </p><p>
The only solution for this is not to use drugs! </p><h3>
Too much alcohol </h3><p>
Alcohol may be legal, but it is still a kind of drug. In the US alone, about 14 
million people have been diagnosed with disorders associated with alcohol (not 
the occasional social drink or wine with dinner, real heavy stuff). Again, the 
dependency, the money required and the social shame are huge stressors. By the 
way, alcohol stress is a matter of life and death, because more than 100,000 
deaths each year in the US are caused by excessive alcohol. </p><p>
The solution is not to drink! </p><h3>
Narrow mindedness </h3><p>
Narrow minded people cannot see options in difficult situations. They feel 
disappointed and frustrated with many conflicts and crises in their life, but do 
not see any way out of them. This inability to see options and solutions creates 
lots of stress and a feeling of helplessness. </p><p>
The way to overcome this problem is to look at situations from different points 
of view - big picture, more detailed, future perspective or &quot;What would I do if 
this were a similar situation in a different setting?&quot; Ask yourself &quot;What are my 
options?&quot;, &quot;What is the worst thing that can happen if I do &lt;each option&gt;?&quot; and 
&quot;In two years, what will I think about this situation?&quot; </p><h3>
Negativity </h3><p>
Negativity can cause a lot of stress. Negative people see a black future, they 
find faults in many things, they lack hope and motivation and this drains them 
of their energy. Being a negative person is like living in an ambulance while 
only hearing constant pain and expecting that the next patient will die and the 
next one and the next one &#8230; every time, all the time. Negative people forget 
that the ambulance is all about saving lives. </p><p>
To change from a negative to a positive mindset requires the ability to see 
good, do good and respond in a good way to things. Focusing on a positive 
outcome, visualizing a good future and having positive affirmations can greatly 
reduce stress. The funny thing is that good exists everywhere and it only takes 
a decision to start seeing it. </p><h3>
Difficulty to self express </h3><p>
One of the biggest stress-causing challenges is people's difficulty to express 
their feelings and their thoughts. When people bottle up, this creates pressure 
that may one day blow up, more often than not out of proportion. </p><p>
The solution is always to find someone to talk to. It can be a friend you trust 
or a professional. Alternatively, you can find a creative way to express 
yourself. Art provides wonderful ways of self expression. It is a good idea to 
have such an outlet long before the tension becomes too heavy to bear. In 
stressful situations, find a way to rearrange your thoughts and sort out your 
emotions. </p><p>
Everyone, without any exceptions, experiences stress in life. Being 
unpredictable and exciting, life contains many stressors. Instead of letting 
stress control you, take the responsibility of opening the door and getting out 
of your ambulance. There is a beautiful, safe world out there. </p>
