<h1>Is arrogance creeping in on you?</h1>

Is arrogance creeping in on you?</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Thejendra BS</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A general dictionary defines arrogance in many ways like, &#8220;Offensive display 
of superiority, self-importance, overbearing pride, pompous, haughtiness, 
behaving in a superior manner toward inferiors, etc.&#8221; </p>
<p>Each one of us would have 
definitely seen or experienced arrogance by someone at some time. An arrogant 
person can impact you in many ways, and depending on your current position you 
may or may not be able to control such people. For example, an arrogant 
professor, teacher, boss or reputed personalities can make life hell for all his 
subordinates, and continue to behave with brazen superiority with everyone for 
years. </p>
<p>Often you will not be able to do anything because such people control 
your core necessities like passing exams, promotions, salary hikes, sales 
figures, brand, etc. But in some cases you can hit back with all your power at 
arrogant people. Nevertheless arrogant people in all walks of life are a pain 
and will be an important topic of discussion everywhere. Behind the back gossip 
like, &quot;He or she has become arrogant now, but wasn&#8217;t like that before&quot; is quite 
common in most workplaces, amongst friends, relatives, etc. However it does not 
mean arrogant people will be boorish with everyone, but they will definitely not 
miss an opportunity to demonstrate it on someone they can afford to be rude 
with. </p>
<p>Often the person being branded arrogant may not truly realize they have 
indeed become arrogant. For example, we rarely think of ourselves as being 
arrogant as we usually believe it is always someone else who can be arrogant, 
but not us. But arrogance does exist in various degrees in everyone, including 
you and me. Now suppose you discover that people who matter to you are calling 
you arrogant behind your back? Or worse, someone tells you flat on your face 
that you are indeed arrogant. What will be your reaction? It can rudely jolt you 
from the grand benevolent image you hold of yourself. </p>
<p>Being branded arrogant is 
something that nobody would like to hear. You could get furious, outraged and 
vehemently disagree with their opinion. Or, if you can control your senses, you 
can stop and think of it as a wake up call to mend your ways. Arrogance is like 
a special body odour that you can&#8217;t smell, but others can. But unless somebody 
tells you openly, or you have a mirror of snow white's stepmother you don&#8217;t get 
to realize it. Similar to how people recognize the harmful effects of junk food, 
high cholesterol, etc., it is also important to recognize some vital signs that 
could make one arrogant over time. </p>
<p>So what are those signs that can make you 
arrogant? Well here are seven signs that could make you arrogant over time, 
unless you take appropriate steps to puncture your bloated ego periodically. </p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Knowledge</b>: Your subject knowledge is good and improving day by day. 
  People come to you for advice, tips, guidance. You have all the answers for 
  anything and everything, or you believe so. Soon you begin to think you have 
  become an expert in everything and feel others are now dependant on you. And 
  you gradually become dismissive of suggestions and recommendations by others, 
  except yours, of course. </li>
  <li><b>Salary</b>: You have a juicy salary. You are able to pay all your 
  bills, loans, expenses and still have plenty of spare money to buy the things 
  you desire. Your bank balance makes you feel invincible and you start 
  comparing everyone based on the money they make. </li>
  <li><b>Job title</b>: You have a fancy job title that can create an aura of 
  awe around you. Titles having groovy words like global, enterprise, strategy, 
  leader, etc., can quietly corrupt a person&#8217;s ego faster than a person who is 
  having a mediocre title like sales manager, though both could be doing 
  identical ordinary jobs. </li>
  <li><b>Contacts</b>: You develop contacts and connections with reputed people, 
  famous personalities, top brass, etc., and hover around important people. You 
  have the blessings of a powerful godfather who worships the ground you walk 
  on, protects you, listens to you and does not make a move without consulting 
  you. So you now feel like a VIP with the power to crush ordinary mortals. </li>
  <li><b>Successes</b>: Frequent success and winning can be a powerful arrogance 
  booster. For example, you have had a series of successes and promotions that 
  are the envy of others. Everything you touch turns to gold. Or you have been 
  very smart and quick in burying your failures before anyone notices them. Or 
  somebody is doing the work and producing the results, while you are getting 
  the rewards and hikes. During temporary lucky periods in life a feeling of 
  Midas touch can get into people&#8217;s head. This is often the reason why many 
  sportspersons, film personalities, business owners, etc., become haughty and 
  pushy. </li>
  <li><b>Answers</b>: You don't provide solutions to questions anymore. Instead 
  you now answer every question with another question. You develop the skill to 
  invent a dozen jargon filled smart, tough and tricky questions on the fly that 
  can make others squirm, chew their head off or make them flee from the scene. 
  Of course, it is not necessary for you to know the answers, or if answering is 
  unavoidable, you can invent some more jargon filled questions to confuse the 
  other party. </li>
  <li><b>Personal</b>: In addition to the above factors, an individual&#8217;s 
  personal qualities, or Mother Nature&#8217;s temporary gifts to humans like young 
  age, physical strength, beauty, good health, IQ, etc., can also make one 
  arrogant. </li>
</ol>
<p>Finally the challenge for each one of us is to frequently pause and observe 
ourselves to see if any of the above factors are making us pompous. And we can 
conclude with a quote from Henry W Shaw, &#8220;It is not only the most difficult 
thing to know oneself, but the most inconvenient one, too.&#8221;</p>
