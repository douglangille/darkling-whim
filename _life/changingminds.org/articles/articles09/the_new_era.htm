Selling in Tough Times &#8211; From &#8220;Cronyism&#8221;&#8230; to Collaboration (The 5 C&#8217;s of 
Selling)</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Robert Harris</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In late February, I had the pleasure of delivering a seminar for a national 
sales conference in conjunction with a colleague who specializes in sales, 
marketing and business development. </p>
<p>We were co-presenting to an organization that was requiring its sales force 
to take a new approach to its selling efforts. Today&#8217;s economic climate has 
presented this organization with some tough business challenges that require its 
sales representatives to think and act differently. </p>
<p>I specialize in change leadership and how to influence others; my colleague 
specializes in professional sales skills, so we titled our presentation: &#8220;How to 
Overcome Resistance and Move into a Collaborative Selling Mode.&#8221; Our 
presentation was very well received. Here is a synopsis of some the content. </p>
<h2>5 Generations of Selling </h2>
<p>The reality is&#8230;sales has come a long way. If you look at the selling process 
over the past 60 years, it has really evolved through 5 generations. We call 
these the &#8220;5 C&#8217;s&#8221;. </p>
<h3>1. Cronyism</h3>
<p>The first era of selling, prevalent in the industrial boom 
following world war two, was what we call, &#8220;cronyism&#8221;. In this approach, the 
sales person was essentially your buddy; that is, someone whom you got to know 
well and liked. The sales person would drop by every so often and take your 
order. Times were good and there was very little differentiation of product or 
focus on deeper buyer needs. </p>
<h3>2. Commodity Selling</h3>
<p>The second era took hold from the 1950&#8217;s until mid 
1960&#8217;s where sales people basically sold on price. Again, there was little 
product differentiation, which resulted in discounting and price wars. Sales 
people typically dislike this approach as there is always pressure to cut the 
margins. </p>
<h3>3. Content Selling</h3>
<p>This era of selling was the first to involve a strategic 
differentiation of one product from another. Starting in the 1960&#8217;s through to 
the 1980&#8217;s, professional marketers, with the help of advertising agencies, were 
now able to create brand awareness and customer knowledge as to why one product 
was superior to another. The goal was to educate buyers on the &#8220;features and 
benefits&#8221; of a specific product, and thereby generate excitement in purchasing 
these features and benefits. </p>
<p>Content selling enabled sales people to move away from a commodity approach 
based on lowest price to being able to charge a higher price (with greater 
margins) due to brand awareness and buyer sophistication. </p>
<p>Although this era marks the start of &#8220;professional selling&#8221;, the flaw with a 
features and benefits approach is that it did not take into account the unique 
and differing needs of customers. In effect, this approach was product-centric 
versus customer-centric. Although &#8220;content selling&#8221; raised the likelihood of 
increased sales with some customers, it did not maximize success with all 
customers. Hence the evolution to the 4th era of selling&#8230; </p>
<h3>4. Consultative Selling</h3>
<p>Over the past 20 years, consultative selling has 
been very much in vogue. By the 1980&#8217;s, organizations realized the problem with 
content selling (&#8220;features and benefits&#8221;) was that you may be providing a 
benefit that the customer doesn&#8217;t value, and missing a benefit that the customer 
does want. </p>
<p>In consultative selling, the initial focus is on first understanding the 
deeper needs and buying motives of the customer and then ensuring your product 
fits with these needs and motives. Given that customers value different things, 
this approach requires some product diversity but also presents greater upside 
on the sales front. </p>
<p>However, even consultative selling has a drawback, which is particularly 
apparent in these tough economic times. That is, when the entire focus is on 
meeting the needs of the customer, that negates the very real needs of the 
supplying organization, especially when the business climate is hurting. In 
other words, notwithstanding the critical importance of the customer, if those 
needs are the only ones that matter, then some excellent selling organizations 
may be pushed out of business &#8211; and that indirectly hurts the customer that has 
benefited from this solid customer-supplier relationship. </p>
<p>This brings us to what we see as the dawn of a 5th era in selling &#8211; 
Collaborative Selling. </p>
<h3>5. Collaborative Selling</h3>
<p>In a collaborative selling approach, there is a 
partnering mentality between customer and supplier. Both organizations realize 
that their longer term success is predicated on both of them staying in business 
&#8211; and this means that supplier needs matter too. </p>
<p>We are currently in a well documented economic climate of restraint and 
cutbacks. Sales volumes are down in almost all industries. This means that many 
suppliers will find their revenues decreased and be required to make some tough 
business decisions to survive. </p>
<p>This is where the buying organization&#8217;s role takes precedent. The buyer may 
be able to partner on matters that would typically be the sole responsibility of 
the seller. We are not suggesting that the buyer take a reduction in quality or 
service; that wouldn&#8217;t make sense. But there may be some opportunities where the 
buyer can be flexible in order to help the seller survive. This could include 
some flexibility on payment terms, inventory levels, and other items that help 
the overall bottom line of the seller, without significantly impacting the 
business of the buyer. </p>
<p>In effect, in collaborative selling, both buyer and seller become customers 
to each other. This approach has three (3) primary goals for both organizations: 
</p>
<p>(i) minimize short-term risk </p>
<p>(ii) maximize long term gain and </p>
<p>(iii) create value 
by partnering with each other. </p>
<p>Creating value is recognizing the natural 
synergies that already exist and jointly seeking new ways to be innovative and 
proactive in adding to each partner&#8217;s business success. </p>
<h2>How and When to Move into Collaborative Selling Mode </h2>
<p>We realize that not all customers want to be partners. In fact, for many 
customers, the current focus on consultative selling (with a focus solely on 
their needs) works just fine. For these customers, the sales person should 
continue to do what&#8217;s been working well &#8211; no need to change a winning game! </p>
<p>There are in fact 3 ingredients that cause both buyer and seller to want to 
move from a consultative to a collaborative mode, including: 1. The two 
organizations (buyer, seller) already have a successful and trusting business 
relationship. 2. Each organization needs the other organization to succeed in 
order for it to succeed. 3. There is some element of risk threatening the 
welfare of one organization that potentially could cause harm to both. </p>
<p>When these three conditions are present, it is in the best interests of both 
organizations to partner with each other. Given their already trusting 
relationship, it should be relatively easy for the sales person to articulate 
the needs for flexibility and joint problem solving on matters that were 
traditionally the sole concern of one organization, but not both. </p>
<p>It is also worth pointing out that the &#8220;tables can turn&#8221;, so partnering can 
have reciprocal benefits to both organizations. That is, whereas one 
organization may be struggling today; the other may be struggling tomorrow. 
Working in a collaborative way builds a spirit of reciprocity that can help both 
partners as business cycles ebb and flow. </p>
<h2>Ramifications to Your Sales Success</h2>
<p>Our hope is this article presents the differing approaches to selling and 
gives you insights as to ways you can increase your sales success. </p>
<p>Start with self awareness - what type of sales person are you? Are you still 
sticking to the old ways of &#8220;you scratch my back and I&#8217;ll scratch yours&#8221; 
(cronyism)? Are you engaging in price cutting to secure business but 
significantly hurting your livelihood in the process? Are you still pushing the 
features and benefits of your products even though these are not compatible with 
the deeper buying motives of your customers and prospects? </p>
<p>Hopefully, you are mostly engaged at a higher level of professional selling 
in being consultative with your clients. But don&#8217;t stop there. This article 
gives you suggestions on how to further raise the bar with some key clients and 
thereby significantly reduce the business risk inherent in today&#8217;s precarious 
economic climate. </p>
<p>Collaborative selling makes sense, especially when conveyed in a manner that 
helps both parties over the longer term. By partnering with the seller, the 
buyer receives greater benefits since the business relationship is maintained 
and the opportunity to create value now exists. This will add to the bottom line 
of both organizations. Find ways to make the business case for your customers to 
partner with you, and then move into the new era of selling &#8211; that is, be 
collaborative. </p>
