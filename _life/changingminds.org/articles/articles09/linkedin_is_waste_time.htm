<h1>LinkedIn Is a Waste Of a Sales Person's Time!</h1>

LinkedIn Is a Waste Of a Sales Person's Time!</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Lee B. Salz</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="quote">There are many misconceptions about LinkedIn. It's not just for job searches 
or networking. It is a unique lead generation platform. </p>
<p>I continue to be amazed at the number of sales people who feel that LinkedIn 
doesn't provide any value to them. Yet, these same people spend countless hours 
on Facebook telling people what they ate for breakfast, are leaving for work, or 
entering YouTube links. How is that a benefit to your bank account? </p>
<p>My feelings about LinkedIn are not theoretical and I'm not a paid advertiser 
of it. I am a beneficiary of this social media/marketing platform. I've 
personally used LinkedIn to build two businesses with this website as the 
primary lead source. Just last week, I was speaking to a skeptical sales team 
about LinkedIn and the opportunity it provides. Two minutes before I was going 
to demonstrate how to use this medium, I received an email from a president of a 
company interested in hiring me for sales management consulting who had found me 
through an article I published on LinkedIn. Rather than start the LinkedIn 
discussion with a demo of the technology, I put the email up on the screen and 
the skepticism evaporated. </p>
<p>LinkedIn provides sales people with a unique lead generation opportunity. 
However, the operative word is unique which means that the approach needs to be 
geared toward this medium. Imagine having prospects coming to you rather than 
you chasing them. It can be done if you have the right social media strategy 
when using this tool. This is marketing's job, right? Wrong! It is a co-shared 
responsibility. They have the global responsibility for positioning your 
company, but there is a role for sales people to play as well. </p>
<p>For starters, you need to take the approach that you are going to position 
yourself as a thought leader in your industry...an expert. Remember, as a sales 
person, you know more about your solutions than your prospective clients 
regardless of their title. You track industry movement and trends&#8230;much more than 
the users of your products. This approach sets you on your mission of providing 
value with the goal of positioning yourself as an expert in your space. This 
will lead people to want to be associated with (or linked) to you. </p>
<p>The first step is to review your profile page on LinkedIn. What message is 
conveyed to someone who is reviewing your profile? This is where many sales 
people get stuck. They try to use their LinkedIn profile for multiple 
purposes...network with friends (save that for Facebook), leave the door open 
for a job search, and business development. That approach doesn't work as there 
is no clear message as to why you are on LinkedIn or what you seek to 
accomplish. </p>
<p>If your plan is to use LinkedIn for lead generation or business development, 
your approach should be linear. Your profile and recommendations should clearly 
position your role in your industry. Since you are not using LinkedIn, in this 
instance, for a job search, there is no reason to list jobs that don't reinforce 
your expertise. Provide only the information that helps paint the picture for 
the impression you want profile visitors to have of you. </p>
<p>When writing your bio, don't shoot for length&#8230;aim for focus. A one-paragraph 
bio that positions you in your industry as an expert is the goal. In this 
instance, people don't care about your personal information. If you aren't sure 
your bio conveys the desired message, have your peers read it and ask what 
message they derive from it. </p>
<p>Testimonials are very important. Your company probably has plenty of 
references for its product, service, or technology offering. However, your 
LinkedIn testimonials should be about you. What value do your clients receive by 
working with you? How do you support their account? Invite those whom you have 
earned the right to request a testimonial about their experience in working with 
you. The goal is not to get them to write that you are a sweetheart, but rather 
the results they received from working with you. </p>
<p>Remember, your profile serves as the foundation for everything else you will 
do on LinkedIn. All roads lead back to this page. </p>
<p>With your profile developed, the next step is to join groups. Again, the goal 
is to be linear. As a free member on LinkedIn, you can join up to 50 groups. It 
may seem like a lot, but you'll be surprised how quickly you use them. Using the 
search function at the top of the page on LinkedIn, search for groups using 
keywords that will show where your target clients are. If you are in employment 
screening, you may want to search on security, security professionals, small 
business, human resources, human resources professionals, etc. </p>
<p>The search will return a list of groups shown in order of number of members 
with the largest groups shown first. Join the largest ones, right? Wrong! How 
can you be visible with 50,000 members? You'll get lost. Ideally, join groups 
that have between 1,000 and 5,000 members. At that size, the group has enough 
mass to justify your time investment, but is not so large that you can't make 
yourself visible. </p>
<p>Once you are accepted into the group, there are a number of things you can 
do. Remember, your mission is to provide value first, not seeking to get buyers. 
Review the active discussions and participate in those where you can provide key 
insight. Resist the temptation to hawk your product here. Value first! (A 
suggestion&#8230;compose your responses using Word so you can spell/grammar check what 
you have written. LinkedIn does not have that functionality.) </p>
<p>You can also create discussions in groups. Don't create discussions that 
directly map back to the sale of your product. The group members will blast you 
for that. Use this opportunity to get key insight into the challenges that your 
buyers are experiencing. If you sell for a risk mitigation firm, you could 
create a discussion around the H1N1 pandemic and how organizations are handling 
this issue. </p>
<p>When people participate in discussions, their photo and link to their profile 
page are provided next to their comments. (Now, you see why your profile page is 
so important.) When readers are intrigued by comments, they research the author. 
When you are engaged in online discussions in a group, you can invite the member 
into your LinkedIn network. (Don't use the LinkedIn invite template&#8230;craft your 
own message.) </p>
<p>Once the members are in your network, you have a number of ways you can 
communicate with them. Remember, focus on value in every interaction. Want to 
learn more secrets to using LinkedIn for lead generation, send me an email 
requesting my LinkedIn tipsheet. </p>
<p>Note. Before embarking on this journey, be sure to review your company's 
social media policy and/or check with your manager for approval. </p>
