The Psychology of selling: Telemarketing</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Mark Anthony, President of Training For Success</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The key to higher sales is developing a presentation that taps into your 
prospect's psychological needs. Each phase of the sales process satisfies a need 
that moves your customer closer to the sale. </p>
<p>In a telemarketing presentation, tapping into your prospect's psychological 
needs allows you to overcome the disadvantages of not having visuals or face to 
face contact. Several keys to unleashing your sales power are hidden in the 
attention, interest, proof and closing steps of a sales call.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Curiosity</h3>
<p>Human nature makes people curious; therefore, you can instantly capture the 
prospects attention by designing your opening to target the need for 
information. </p>
<p>One way this is accomplished is with the use of a benefits hook. A benefits 
hook asks the prospect if they would want a particular need solved. It is asked 
as a rhetorical question and obviously your product can help solve the problem.
</p>
<p>For example: If there was a way you could help protect the environment for 
your children would that be important to you? If you could increase repeat 
business by 38% how important would that be? In each case the prospect knows 
this is a sales call but the benefit is significant. The prospect is intrigued. 
Curiosity makes them want to learn more. It is essential that the prospect gets 
hooked on a possible benefit immediately from the start. Getting the prospect 
curious about a benefit prior to discussing your product is crucial to sales 
success.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Use RADAR to increase sales</h3>
<p>A technique I call R.A.D.A.R. satisfies many of the prospects emotional needs 
during the interest step. </p>
<p>The R stands for rapport. People are much more likely to buy from someone 
they like. Most prospects want to be helpful, polite and friendly. It feels 
good. We can create that mood by showing interest in the client as a person by 
simply asking questions about them as an individual. Questions such as: how did 
you get into the advertising business or what made you go into business for 
yourself will get the prospect to open up and they will be less defensive. </p>
<p>The A.D. stands for Asking about Difficulties. People are programmed to avoid 
pain. The greater the pain the faster they will move to avoid it. </p>
<p>What is your biggest difficulty with discount long distance calling plans? Or 
what is your major concern when selecting an insurance carrier? Are questions 
that get the prospect to notice a difficulty (pain) that they should consider 
changing. Difficulty question also guides us on how to direct our presentation 
to what is relevant to the specific prospect. </p>
<p>The second A stands for affirmation questions. One of our greatest desires is 
to be heard. People love to be listened to and understood. By asking &quot;If I 
understood you correctly, what you said is ____________, isn't it?&quot; This little 
question will thrill the client because it shows that you were listening to 
them. This is an experience we all enjoy and unfortunately many prospects do not 
experience often enough. You benefit by showing the prospect that you are 
different than other people and also confirm that you are focusing on the right 
issue. </p>
<p>Results: Another essential psychological need is to feel in control of our 
lives. </p>
<p>People are driven to action when they feel those actions create result s that 
will move their lives forward. Ask your clients what benefits they want to 
experience by eliminating their problem. Try to learn how that will specifically 
improve their life. When you know their key motivation you can easily show the 
prospect how they can take control of their life and improve it. The emphasis 
shifts to their buying rather than you selling. </p>
<p>R.A.D.A.R. taps into many of our prospect is psychological motivations. To 
reap the greatest benefits be sure to use open ended questions where the client 
typically gives you an explanation instead of just a yes or no response. </p>
<p>Psychology selling skills require you to know your prospect therefore we have 
spent the first part of the sales process learning about the individual rather 
than focusing on a product. It is not until completing RADAR that we start 
discussing our product. In the proving value phase of the sales process top 
producers focus on selling benefits not facts.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Satisfy the ego</h3>
<p>People need to be smart and they love to be right. When we prove our 
product's value the client has many opportunities to be smart and right. For 
instance, you can have them work out the savings benefits from using your 
product. You can get the prospect to point out how your product's features solve 
their problems and concerns. When you allow them to see the benefits that come 
from your products features you move toward the sale. When you have the prospect 
state it as their idea you move very close to getting the sale. </p>
<p>Many reps frequently get sales like this without even realizing it. When the 
client stops the presentation and says I'll take it before you even ask a 
closing question the rep has brought the prospect to this state.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Buying is the prospect's idea</h3>
<p>Another key to psychology selling is to let the prospect feel they are buying 
rather than being sold. In the closing phase of a presentation a client should 
never feel forced to buy. Prospects hate to be pushed and will resist if they 
feel you are selling for your benefit. When you move them through the sales 
process and tap into each of the techniques discussed the prospect will decide 
to buy because they see it benefits them. They are excited and feel good about 
this. </p>
<p>By focusing on developing rapport, uncovering the prospects pain and solving 
it with adequate benefits you will have ample opportunity to steer the prospect 
to a buying decision. </p>
<p>By using the techniques outlined here the prospect will feel confident in 
their purchase. They will not feel sold or coerced when you meet the prospect's 
psychological needs. The sale will be solid, your customers more loyal, and very 
likely to share referrals and recommendations. </p>
<p>Consistently high producers in telemarketing do more than focus on what they 
say to their prospect. The top achievers also take a close look at themselves 
and their sales habits.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Set goals</h3>
<p>It is not enough to want higher sales. You must have a specific $ or unit 
amount in mind for a given time period that stretches you to do your best work 
while remaining realistic. </p>
<p>When you put your goal in writing your mind begins to turn your intangible 
dreams into reality. The mind needs specific direction. All professionals know 
where they are going. Give your brain a detailed goal and the worlds most 
powerful computer will automatically guide you to top performance.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Reap rewards</h3>
<p>Sell benefits to yourself as well as your prospect. As you set goals and 
achieve positive results be aware of how your growth benefits you and your 
family. Be specific. Will you win an incentive trip for your family, get a bonus 
that allows you to go to your favorite restaurant or will extra commissions 
allow you to afford a new car? </p>
<p>When your mind sees the benefits that come from your extra efforts your 
skills will rise to the level necessary to bring those benefits into your life.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Enthusiasm and Smiles</h3>
<p>Enthusiasm is contagious. If you are enthusiastic about your product you will 
be more successful. This is crucial in telemarketing. Your voice is your 
greatest asset in conveying the attributes of your product or service. </p>
<p>If you are excited, your prospect will sense that there is something good 
here. It is your enthusiasm that brings a script to life. </p>
<p>Smiling is one of the most natural ways to bring your enthusiasm to the 
surface. When we smile we are friendlier, more energetic and enthusiastic. Even 
when you don't feel like smiling, do it. Your mind will automatically be 
triggered into a happier state of being.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Script and Pad</h3>
<p>Even the simplest of presentations should be written out. </p>
<p>A script allows you to select the most appropriate wording to move your 
prospect through the sales process and to use that wording on each and every 
call. </p>
<p>Even more importantly having a script in front of you allows you to put your 
energy into listening to the prospect rather than thinking about what to say 
next. When you uncover an important need, problem, or interest of the prospect's 
jot it down. Writing it down assures that you will remember the point, work it 
into your presentation and leaves your mind clear to listen for more vital 
information.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>Call Averaging</h3>
<p>Call reluctance is a problem that plagues even the heartiest of 
telemarketers. Put the emphasis on average $/ call instead of the calls that 
result in a sale. That way every dial becomes profitable for the rep including 
hang ups and not ins. </p>
<p>For example: if a rep makes a $100 sale every 20 calls it could be viewed as 
19 no sales and one sale or 20 $5 sales. When telemarketers see every dial as a 
sale, they make more calls. This approach offers several benefits. First of all 
it takes the pressure off each call. It helps eliminates &quot;cherry picking 
prospects&quot; and procrastinating on the non hot leads. Lastly, it allows a 
telemarketing representative to know exactly how many calls they must handle 
each day to reach their financial goals. </p>
<p>As a telemarketer takes stock in their selling skills and develops the habit 
of designing their presentations to satisfy the prospect's psychological needs, 
they will create strong client relationships while increasing sales. </p>
<p>Sales success can be further enhanced as each sales representative reviews 
their own motivations and habits. When the selling process meets the needs of 
all parties involved telemarketing representatives develop into true 
professionals.<br>
<br>
</p>
