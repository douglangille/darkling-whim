The serious art of writing humor</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Thejendra BS</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has often been said that everyone likes humor and laughter on our planet. 
Well maybe not everyone, but almost every person who is normal will like humor 
provided someone else makes them laugh. And you can always enjoy reading a funny 
article or book written by somebody. But have you ever considered writing a 
funny article yourself, or maybe even write a funny book sometime? Even if you 
know how to write regular articles and books the very thought of writing 
something funny and showing it to others can turn your blood cold or make your 
hair stand straight. There are plenty of writers on our planet who can write 
countless topics in a serious, straightforward manner. But very few know how to 
add one magical component into their writing to make it more palatable and 
enjoyable. And that magical component is humor. If you want your writing to be 
enjoyed by your intended audience then you must add an acceptable dose of clean 
humor into it. It is the lack of humor that makes most articles and books 
tasteless even if it contains useful stuff. Writing about any serious topic you 
are familiar with is perhaps easy, but adding humor to it is very difficult and 
sometimes even dangerous if you take too many liberties. Hence you must learn 
some basic rules if you want to write humor and make your stuff enjoyable. And 
those top secret tips are outlined below. </p>
<ol>
	<li>The first rule for anyone who want to write humor is to become bold. 
	Contrary to what most people think humor writers are actually very brave 
	people. You need to develop a thick skin, nerves of steel and become brave 
	slowly day by day. You cannot be funny if you are scared to poke fun at 
	things, issues, people, etc. And you can't be funny if you're afraid of 
	embarrassing yourself or lampooning a famous personality. Verbally anyone 
	can be funny, but it takes guts to put the same in writing and let the 
	public read, and maybe the entire world see it. So humorists need a lot of 
	courage to write and publish something funny about an issue, person or a 
	concept. </li>
	<li>A humorous person has no limit on what he or she can think or write 
	about. You must be able to think in atrocious, ridiculous, crazy, illogical 
	and nonsense terms. Modern management consultants call this thinking out of 
	the box, but I call it old fashioned creativity and humor that has existed 
	from centuries. </li>
	<li>What is important is that you should make your readers think what you 
	have written is funny. But as a person who writes humor you need not look 
	funny, act funny or make goofy antics. You should become a person that 
	nobody would suspect of writing funny and witty stuff. You can be a serious 
	type of person and yet have the ability to write fantastic humor. This adds 
	more spice and an aura of mystery to your personality. </li>
	<li>Most people think writing humor is simply about saying and writing jokes 
	about other people. But this is only partially true. Top humorists mainly 
	make fun of themselves and not about someone. The best humor is always self 
	directed. Direct the humor towards yourself that way you will not annoy 
	anyone. People will laugh if you make fun of yourself, but they may be 
	outraged if you make fun of them. The most important thing about writing 
	humor is to allow your readers to laugh at you and with you, and then 
	optionally at themselves. </li>
	<li>Unless your article is for MAD magazine or a pure humor or satire piece 
	with no restrictions, there are various do's and don'ts that one should 
	follow when writing humor. Don&#8217;t use bad language. Don't make fun of 
	religion, caste, race, physical disabilities, gender or language of anyone. 
	Humor in these areas can start riots on the streets or even start a war. 
	Don't use real names of people, friends, relatives, co-workers, etc. You 
	will never know how they may get offended. But no one will be offended if 
	you focus on yourself. </li>
	<li>When writing humor surprise your readers. That is, don't tell or 
	announce upfront about your funny intention. Don't tell the reader that they 
	will experience something funny. Let the reader discover that for himself. 
	Use concise, direct and simple words that everyone can understand. </li>
	<li>It is not funny to be always funny. There is a time to be funny and 
	there is a time NOT to be funny. And this is something you need to observe 
	and learn. Something that is extremely funny in one place may not be 
	understood at all in another. Something that is funny on a rowdy football 
	stadium may sound offensive inside a religious place. And in some situations 
	or circumstances you should not indulge in anything funny no matter how 
	irresistible it is to write something hanky panky. </li>
	<li>8. A piece of writing can never be final and fully funny in one go. Like 
	a diamond it needs to trimmed, improved and polished as much as possible. 
	You need to review it in terms of using a better sentence, a more 
	mischievous word, rearranging the sentences, modifying to a completely 
	different angle or deleting something that does not seem right, etc. After 
	you think you have finished writing a humor piece revisit it after a few 
	hours or a couple of days. Suddenly you can discover new and better ways of 
	writing the same article that can seem vastly superior to your previous 
	article. </li>
	<li>Think wild, think crazy but at the same time be moderate so that it does 
	not put anyone, including yourself, in trouble. Often in your enthusiasm 
	words and sentences can flow like a mad river and you may write something 
	horrible that you momentarily think is funny or harmless. But it could be 
	laced with trouble when reviewed carefully. So take care to frequently pause 
	your writing to view it from different angles and from the reader's 
	perspective. Then you may need to give your writing a haircut and then 
	continue. </li>
	<li>The final piece of advice is writing humor takes time. To excel in humor 
	is a lifetime job, and is not something that you can learn in a day or two. 
	Don&#8217;t think you can read a joke book and start writing funny stuff an hour 
	later. You will have to teach yourself how to be funny. The process is 
	mostly by trial and error, observing other people's comical situations, 
	mistakes, laughing and applying it on yourself, etc. No one can teach you 
	exactly how to write something funny, but the possibilities of creating 
	humor on anything and everything are limitless.</li>
