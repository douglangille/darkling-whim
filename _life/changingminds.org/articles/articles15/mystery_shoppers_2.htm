<p>At Gold Star, we encourage both experience and novice salespeople to mystery 
shop our competitors. You can do this for many reasons: to expand your knowledge 
of the industry, to polish your own sales strategy, and even to learn how to 
sell against your competitors. </p>
<p>Many salespeople probably would be distressed at how they are 
perceived by their prospects. One of our experienced originators 
recalled when he mystery shopped a major lender and talked to a 
loan officer who seemed to reveal his true motivation. 'The 
salesperson who answered was very short with me, so I took it upon 
myself to dive into the call even more--asking about rates, my house 
and what I would qualify for,' he explained. 'The loan officer gave 
me the greatest picture of the loan program and sent me paperwork 
while we were on the phone so I could review costs. He mentioned 
the fees and an interest rate I thought was a little high. I asked, 'Why 
are you charging me an origination fee?' He responded: 'Well sir, 
just like you, I have to make money, my base salary doesn't support 
my spending habits.' I was shocked. I wondered if he actually got 
clients by making them feel guilty.' </p>
<p>Some salespeople use mystery shopping to expand their 
knowledge of their industry. 'During my training period at another 
company, I made several calls to other lenders and acted like a 
customer to literally teach myself how to better understand 
mortgages,' one of our originators announced during a sales 
meeting. 'I would call and ask them all sorts of questions like what 
was an escrow account, when do I need one, is it mandatory and so 
on. I did this for months because I think my trainer wasn't helping 
much. So this was actually the best training I could have had.' 
Mystery shopping is also advantageous when you are 
introducing a new product or entering a different market. When 
Gold Star was first considering opening an office in Minnesota, we 
wanted to be sure our pricing was in line with other lenders. We 
believed that our 'affordable mortgages at discounted rates' concept 
would be appealing to Minnesota borrowers, yet calls to several area 
lenders indicated that they might have an even lower price structure. 
However, after making a few additional calls, we realized that while 
a few of the state's major lenders were promoting 'no points' 
programs, they were also adding excessive origination fees. Based 
on this research, we were able to easily adapt our normal approach 
to be competitive in this new market. </p>
<p>Mystery shopping research can be especially helpful when 
you are meeting with a prospect who is already working with 
another company. 'We make it a practice to do it (shop) regularly 
and share the information with our entire region to keep everyone 
updated on our competition's latest practices, strengths and 
weaknesses,' the vice president of a major Midwest firm told me. 'It 
becomes essential when you are going in to visit a customer who 
you know uses one of your specific competitors. You have to know 
what you are up against, and how you can sell against them in order 
to earn their business. It has always been effective and will remain 
an essential part of selling.' </p>
<p>When one of our originators says they are having a sales- 
related challenge, I'll usually smile, point to the phone and ask 
'When did you last mystery shop your competitors?' When they 
reply that they haven't done so, I quickly stress what they are 
missing. 'If you haven't mystery shopped yet, you're about two years 
behind, so get started today.' As further incentive, I remind them 
that I still mystery shop several times a week. 
Since the early 1940s, the popularity of mystery shopping 
has increased dramatically. </p>
<p>There are a number of companies that provide mystery shopping services and 
there is even a trade association representing them. The research technique is 
widely used in retail, car dealerships, hotels, restaurants and other 
industries. I suggest you encourage all of the novice salespeople at your 
company to mystery shop a few companies and perfect their own technique. </p>
