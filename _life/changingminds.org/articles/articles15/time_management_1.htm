Time Management Skills in Sales Part 1</p>

<p>I don't know how I can get it all done,' and, 'There just aren't 
enough hours in the day!' must be two of the most often 
repeated phrases by new and veteran salespeople. 
While working an 18-hour day is one way to ensure you can tackle 
a never-ending 'to do' list, most people are either unwilling or 
unable to follow that schedule, so they look for a proven system to 
help make each day more productive. </p>
<p>There are numerous business management gurus who 
promote seemingly fail-safe guidelines for work success, but these 
techniques do not always apply to everyone. For example, many 
experts insist that time blocking is the answer to enhancing your 
organizational effectiveness. Time blockers designate a specific 
period of time each day to accomplish certain tasks. They reason 
that you will achieve maximum efficiency by scheduling an hour in 
the morning for phone calls, followed by 1.5 hours for staff 
meetings, and two hours for customer contact, and one hour for 
returning e-mails, and so on. The problem is that this is often too 
regimented and inflexible for most high volume producers. If you are 
in the phone call hour and a valuable customer visits unexpectedly, 
do you stay with phone calls or meet with the customer? During 
your staff meetings do you ignore calls and let them accumulate 
until you have a long list of callbacks? Time blocking is effective for 
people with a fairly set work schedule that lacks many unexpected 
challenges, but is not necessarily ideal for those who are faced with 
a daily barrage of interruptions. I tried time blocking in my early 
days as a loan originator, and found that I often became more 
concerned about keeping a predetermined schedule than I was 
about accomplishing my daily tasks. </p>
<p>As a salesperson, you must develop your own time management skills. While it 
is important to keep up with the daily duties of the profession, it is also 
necessary to be flexible and adjust when new situations arise. </p>
