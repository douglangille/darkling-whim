Time Management Skills in Sales Part 2</p>

<p>Sales is a profession filled with long hours, high stress, and constant 
changes; therefore, time management skills are extremely important to develop. 
I'm going to let you in on my own time management system and I suggest you 
develop your own accordingly. </p>
<p>My time management system is simpler than most. Every 
evening I make a handwritten list of what I want to accomplish the 
following day, often waking up late at night to add a few new items. 
Of course, I realize that my list will most likely expand significantly 
with a series of 'follow-up ASAP' notations and 'don't forget to' 
reminders. I do use a BlackBerry to keep track of key action items, 
but I still rely on the written list. I review the daily assignments on 
my 45-minute ride to work, while also talking to clients, assistants 
and business partners. On one winter morning I was driving to a 
meeting with one of our sales managers. During the ride I was going 
through my usual routine of calls, lists and e-mails. I just finished a 
call to a customer when my passenger said: 'I just saw you do more 
in an hour than most people get done in a week.' A little hyperbole 
perhaps, but it does underscore my emphasis on packing the most 
into each day. The morning commute to work enables me to get 
some of my 'to do' list done and helps put me in the best working 
mindset. I think most salespeople could benefit from a self- 
motivational pep talk so that they look forward to the day, rather 
than wasting energy dreading the tasks they face. </p>
<p>Once at the office, I close the door on my personal issues--a 
needed plumbing repair, weekend plans, and other potential 
distractions--to concentrate on my mission of closing more 
transactions and helping manage the company. As soon as I sit 
down, I begin taking calls from a wide variety of people anxious 
clients, prospects, lenders, Realtors, and Gold Star salespeople and 
support staff. Throughout the day I juggle a myriad of management 
tasks along with my own sales activity. While I now spend only 
about 40 percent of my day on personal sales, this remains the part 
about which I am most passionate. Making sales enables me to stay 
connected to the lifeblood of the company. After all, I realized a 
major goal when I finally became a top-producing originator, and I 
have always been fascinated by the wide variety of sales situations, 
from the mundane to the highly complex. I especially enjoy talking 
with prospects who challenge me with a series of objections or 
questions before we reach an agreement. I never get tired of hearing 
something similar to 'You've answered all of my questions and I'm 
ready to do business.' I am convinced that if salespeople can 
maintain this same enthusiasm, the excitement about being 
challenged by prospective customers, they will never grow tired of 
their job. </p>
<p>I strongly believe that sales managers must continue to sell at 
some level; otherwise it is difficult to relate to their salespeople and 
there is a tendency to become insulated from customers. All of our 
top managers originate loans on a regular basis, which helps them 
better understand the everyday challenges of today's customer and 
also creates a stronger bond among their salespeople. Producing 
managers are a unique breed of people who have a special skill set 
and temperament. They are able to juggle the demands of their own 
sales activity while being responsible for overseeing the actions of a 
group of other salespeople and staff or an entire office. They are 
typically top producers who their company wants to lead other 
salespeople to greater success. </p>
<p>While everyone has a different way of approaching the day, you must determine 
your own time management process if you want to become successful. The ability 
to be flexible, passionate, and organized are important characteristics of a 
successful salesperson. </p>
