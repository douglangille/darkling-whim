Know The Important Differences Between Business Storytelling and StoryBranding</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: James Signorelli</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;<p>
</p>
<p>Business storytelling and storybranding are often thought of as the same 
thing. Both can be found in the same story toolbox, but they are as different as 
flat blade and Phillips screwdrivers. <p>
Storytelling is the more commonly used tool.<p>
You may not be aware of it, but anytime you talk about events associated with 
how you or your company has had to deal with some problem, you are telling a 
story. If your story is well told, your audience will be able to visualize what 
happened and identify with the central problem as you describe it. And if you&#8217;ve 
captivated their interest, you might hear a &#8220;Wow!,&#8221; &#8220;Really?,&#8221; &#8220;Oh No!,&#8221; or get 
some other emotional reaction.<p>
Stories clothe facts with emotion. For this reason, storytelling in business is 
a way to involve audiences with messages more memorably and with greater impact 
than facts alone. It&#8217;s unlikely that you will ever see anyone get goose bumps 
looking at a line graph. Embed those same facts within a story? Still, goose 
bumps may be asking for too much. But the chances of gaining some sort of 
emotional engagement will definitely be increased.<p>
</p>
<p>This is why storytelling has always been a go-to technique in advertising. 
And it is why more and more companies are training their leaders and salespeople 
how to use storytelling as a business tool.<p>
Storybranding is a different tool used for a different business purpose.<p>
Unlike storytelling, storybranding isn&#8217;t used to help audiences identify with 
events and the way these events are described by the storyteller. Rather, 
storybranding is used to help brands associate with a strong and enduring value 
or belief system. In brand briefs, this is sometimes mistaken for a description 
of the brand&#8217;s personality or how it should be portrayed i.e. bold, unique, 
caring, or responsive. But directing a brand to exhibit a personality trait is 
like directing a stage actor to show passion or be courageous. It becomes more 
natural for the actor to show passion, courage, or any other personality trait 
by helping him get in touch with his character&#8217;s belief system.<p>
</p>
<p>Storybranding ratchets brands up to something more powerful than a display of 
certain personality traits. It does this by defining the brand&#8217;s authentic 
motivational thrust underlying its personality. This thrust could be the 
strongly adhered to value placed upon scooping competitive rivals with 
technological advancements, the belief that being friendly is not the same as 
&#8220;doing&#8221; friendly, or the importance that is placed on being obsessive about 
quality control. In effect, storybrands internalize beliefs that more naturally 
manifest themselves in their outward appearances.<p>
The most important purpose behind storybranding is to help companies become 
identified with certain ideals. And it&#8217;s a purpose that comes with a very big 
reward. This was demonstrated in a study conducted Jim Stengel, the former 
global marketing officer with Procter and Gamble. In his book Grow: How Ideals 
Power Growth and Profit for the World's Greatest Companies, Stengel documents 
how brands that could be identified by their ideals, outperformed the S&amp;P, on 
average, by over 400% over a 10-year period. </p>
<p>To take full advantage of how the use storybranding, companies need to first 
do some internal processing. My friend Joey Reiman best describes the most 
important aspect of this process in his book, The Purpose of Story. He states 
that management has to first make clear the distinction between a brand&#8217;s point 
of difference and its point of view. The former has to do with function. The 
latter has to do with the brand's cause, or a crusade the has decided to lead.
</p>
<p>Features and benefits are copied or upgraded all of the time. For this 
reason, focusing on unique functional properties may provide short-term rewards, 
at best. But, baring events that could possibly derail their images, storybrands 
like Harley Davidson, Disney, Virgin and Southwest Airlines will be known for 
their unique points of view long into the future. The reason for this is that 
these brands, and others that follow their example, satisfy the primal need for 
belonging, a need that is satisfied when potential buyers become assured that 
there's a company that shares their beliefs. Satisfying this need far outweighs 
the long-term value of any functional benefit the brand provides today and is 
surpassed by a competitor tomorrow.<p>
In many ways, storybrands are like authors who want to provide their audience 
something more than an interesting or exciting plot. These are authors who care 
a great deal about the theme of the their stories as well their plots.<p>
<p>
</p>

&nbsp;</p><hr>
<p>Jim Signorelli is the Founder and President of
<a href="http://www.story-lab.net/">Story-Lab</a>.</p>
<p>Jim started his career selling for a small country radio station. He will 
tell you that it was hard achieving success selling for a station that played 
Hank Williams 40 times a day. At least that was true until he discovered his 
clients didn&#8217;t care so much about his station&#8217;s music. They cared more about 
commercials that could generate results. So Jim put his energies against 
becoming a skilled copywriter. This experience is what launched a successful 
30-year career creating advertising for well-known brands like McDonald&#8217;s, Kraft 
Foods, General Electric, Citibank, Burger King, to name a few. </p>
<p>During that time, Jim discovered that success in advertising, sales, or 
marketing is not achieved soley by boasting &#8220;unique&#8221; benefits.. Rather, success 
largely depends on an ability to find, create, and tell stories that build trust 
while sharing important beliefs and values. He ended up writing two 
award-winning books on this subject and started conducting workshops for leaders 
and sales professionals, helping them employ the influential power of story.. 
This led to what is now <a href="http://www.story-lab.net/">Story-Lab</a>, a 
company he founded and one that conducts storytelling workshops for leaders and 
sales professionals. </p>
