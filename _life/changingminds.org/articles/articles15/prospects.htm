Prospects Aren't Always Prospects</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
As sellers, we&#8217;ve been taught that someone with a need that our solution 
fulfills is a prospect. But that&#8217;s not true or we&#8217;d be closing a lot more 
business and wasting a lot less time following the wrong prospects. Just because 
we see a need does not mean they A. want it resolved, B. want it resolved now, 
C. have the buy-in to bring in an external solution rather than using their own 
internal fix or beloved vendor, D. are ready to give up the work-around they 
have in place that resolves the problem well-enough. So rule number #1: need 
does not a prospect make.<p>
Unfortunately, the sales model has no capability to go behind-the-scenes to 
facilitate buy-in from the within the buyer's culture/system &#8211; the other people 
who don&#8217;t see a need or don&#8217;t want to share budget, the tech group that wants to 
do it all themselves, or the President who has her own agenda and hasn&#8217;t 
informed everyone yet. But, and here&#8217;s rule #2: until everyone and everything 
that will touch the new solution buys-in to bringing it on board, there will be 
no purchase, regardless of a need.<h2>
A BUYING DECISION IS A CHANGE MANAGEMENT PROBLEM</h2>
<p>
Buyers have change management problems, not solution choice problems; a solution 
purchase (or any sort of change) is merely the last element in a chain of events 
- assembling the right Buying Decision Team members, getting buy-in, maintaining 
the status quo to avoid disruption - that must manage any change (and a purchase 
represents change) to enable the status quo to maintain it's comfort. Rule #3: 
the status quo is sacrosanct, regardless of the need or the efficacy of your 
solution.<p>
Here are two situations in which I failed miserably (and lost quite a bit of 
money), prior to understanding that buyers (in companies and individuals) must 
manage internal change before they can buy.<p>
I did a pilot for an iconic multinational. Using Buying Facilitation® the group 
had a 400% increase in sales over the control group (we shortened the sales 
cycle from 7 months to 4 weeks). They chose not to role out my program because 
the problems caused by increased revenue and cash flow issues, shifts in the 
manufacturing schedules, etc., would cost many millions to fix. They eschewed 
the increased profit to maintain the system.<p>
I trained a large insurance group that got a 600% increase in sales over the 
control group (they went from 110 visits and 18 closed sales to 27 visits and 25 
closed sales). After the test month, the trained team handed in their 
resignations because they said they were &#8216;field sales&#8217; reps and would rather 
quit then be 'inside sales' reps, regardless of how much money they made. They 
liked handing out donuts and schmoozing.<p>
From my point of view this is nuts. But from theirs it made sense. The status 
quo must be maintained at all costs &#8211; at all costs &#8211; regardless of the benefits 
of our solutions. Indeed, if they had known how to change without disrupting the 
status quo, they would have already. Companies prefer excellence, so long as 
they maintain stability. And when we think they are excellent prospects, their 
purchase of our solution might butt up against their needs for stability. Unless 
they can figure out how to address this, they are then not prospects regardless 
of their need or the efficacy of our solution.<h2>
THE SALES MODEL IS SOLUTION-BASED; BUYING IS SYSTEMS-BASED</h2>
<p>
Philosophically the sales model is accurate: as sellers we clearly see needs 
that our solutions will resolve. But it&#8217;s not a prospect until or unless the 
Buying Decision Team &#8211; everyone who will touch the final solution &#8211; is ready, 
willing, and able to<ul>
	<li>bring in our solution and knows how to manage any changes in people, rules or 
job descriptions,</li>
	<li>bring in new technology without downtime,</li>
	<li>ensure the disruption won't cost more than the problem it's resolving,</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
they cannot buy. Indeed: a prospect is someone who WILL buy (and knows how to 
manage their change), not someone who SHOULD buy.<p>
I developed Buying Facilitation® in 1983 to manage the issues my own sales team 
faced in my tech startup. As a sales professional, I never understood why 
&#8216;prospects&#8217; weren&#8217;t buying as often as was logical. When I became an 
entrepreneur, I realized the problem buyers have when I needed to purchase 
solutions myself: how could I buy new software when the new programs weren't 
working yet? When would be the right time to add new folks since the last new 
batch wasn't fully trained yet? How would a new manager work with the current 
team when the current team had been working so effectively as unit for so long? 
When potential vendors came in to pitch new solutions to me, I understood the 
curiosity I had as a seller: the problem was not my need, but about managing my 
status quo effectively, and the sales model merely focuses on placing solutions 
and ignored the change management issues I had to deal with as part of my buying 
decision process.<p>
So I developed my Buying Facilitation® model to add to sales the capability of 
beginning our prospecting by first facilitating the prospect's ability and 
desire to seek excellence. Then, together (even on a prospecting call), we 
determined and addressed their tolerance for bringing in a new solution. I even 
taught my techies how to facilitate their users to make sure they got the buy-in 
for their programmers and project leaders and get the right people and the right 
data at the right time. We learned to enter each sales call as a facilitator 
rather than as a detective seeking a need/solution match or 'qualifying' a 
prospect immediately according to some specious standard we originally thought 
might have meaning.<p>
Help prospective buyers determine how to change, how to get buy-in, how to bring 
in your solution. Along the way, you both will determine next steps, who needs 
to be included, and how to get everyone on board &#8211; with you! &#8211; to move toward 
the remedy will provide - even on a prospecting call! And then you can sell. 
Buying Facilitation® first, then sales. You need both. Then you can help buyers 
decide to be prospects - and they will buy.</p>
