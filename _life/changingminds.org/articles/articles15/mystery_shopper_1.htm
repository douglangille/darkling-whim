Who is That Mystery Shopper? Part 1</p>

<p>If you don't know how your competitors answer their 
phones, you may be in trouble. It is absolutely essential to understand how the 
competition operates. You cannot effectively sell your product or service if you 
don't know how salespeople at other firms are selling. That means knowing how 
they explain their company's product and program 
features, respond to consumer questions, deal with objections and 
much more. </p>
<p>I am convinced that most salespeople don't take advantage 
of some of the basic intelligence gathering 'tools', including mystery 
shopping, which I first experienced as a McDonald's management 
trainee. One of our tasks was to visit various outlets and see how the 
staff handled their drive-thru and walk-in responsibilities. We would 
evaluate their customer greetings, food quality, delivery time, and 
other critical areas. In hindsight, I am not sure that we were the most 
objective judges, but we did our best, and it was a great learning 
experience. The regional managers also conducted mystery 
shopping research to see how well everyone performed. 
Years later as a new loan originator, I realized that the best 
way for me to understand my competition was to mystery shop other 
companies. </p>
<p>I would call XXX Mortgage Lending and ask for a loan 
originator. When he said, 'Yes Mr. Jones, how can I help?' I 
mentioned my interest in a purchase or refinance and asked about 
their rates, fees, special programs, closing schedules and everything 
else a customer might want to know. The responses varied greatly, 
with each call providing valuable insights about the competition. In 
addition to the basic information gleaned from these conversations, I 
also listened carefully to how they presented themselves. For 
example, whether they sounded interested, impatient or 
condescending, the kind of responses that can quickly influence a 
caller's decision to do business. </p>
<p>In order to gain more insight into your competitor's tactics, you should 
mystery shop them. When growing Gold Star, the data I gathered from mystery 
shopping my competitors helped me refine my own customer presentation. </p>
