Do We Forget Our Values With ‘Different’ People?</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
By any standards, I’m considered successful. A NYTimes bestselling author of 9 
books, an inventor and thought leader, I’ve trained a very large number of 
people globally in a change facilitation model I invented (Buying 
Facilitation®), started up a successful tech company in the 1980s and a 
non-profit that helped thousands of people walk again, and had my picture on the 
cover of magazines. But unless I’m referred, unless people have followed my work 
and know me, I’m patronized, condescended to, ignored, and dismissed in most 
settings. Why? Because I have Asperger’s, and I relate and respond differently.
<p>
I’m told I’m intense, challenging, in your face. And I bet that’s all true, 
although I can’t tell because it all seems normal to me. And then, maybe because 
I don’t conform to the norm, or because I’m a woman, people feel they have the 
right to disrespect me. As a result, my important ideas about facilitating 
others through their own congruent change – so necessary in healthcare, 
leadership, sales, coaching - get ignored, misinterpreted, stolen, or ridiculed. 
And it’s a shame, as these concepts are not only revolutionary, but important 
and would serve a vast number of people.<p>
And sometimes the people who unwittingly disrespect or ignore me are the same 
people who fervently believe in equality, diversity, and #metoo. How do these 
folks forget their values when they actually come face to face with someone like 
me who is merely ‘different’? Where do their values go?<h2>
WE ALL SEEK TO BE KIND</h2>
<p>
In our workplaces, our social lives, the daily lives of our children, our 
schools, our communities, it’s more urgent than ever that we communicate/serve 
others with kindness and equanimity, that we become intentional. But getting it 
right is often like walking an obstacle course. We mean well, but sometimes we 
inadvertently get it wrong. We certainly don&#39;t mean to.<p>
Given our vantage point from the culture we identify with - with inbred norms 
and accepted behaviors – we sometimes unwittingly wound others from unfamiliar 
cultures because we don’t understand our differences. Obviously we can’t stand 
in their shoes, try as we might. Sometimes we don&#39;t have the knowledge to 
automatically behave correctly or recognize a misstep. Sometimes we unknowingly 
bias how we listen. And sometimes we don’t know for certain the correct action 
or communication approach. <p>
I believe that if we operate from the universal values we all hold as human 
values, we will be more inclusive, less hurtful, be far more creative, and serve 
others. It’s time we learn to do the right thing. <p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Kindness. While our intent is usually to be kind, sometimes we unwittingly 
harm. How can we determine if our action will be experienced as hurtful or kind? 
For openers, we could stop making assumptions and begin dialogues by asking our 
communication partners for guidance on best communication styles, or ask to be 
told when/if we misstep. Personally, I hear what’s said differently than 
neurotypicals, and respond accordingly – which often confuses others. When I see 
a quizzical look on someone’s face I immediately ask them what they heard me 
say. I wish I had the ability to avoid the misstep, especially when people walk 
away rather than discuss it with me to find a common language and acceptance.
<p>
To mitigate this problem I’ve learned to introduce myself thus: “I have 
Asperger’s, and sometimes my responses are too direct and can cause hurt. Please 
accept my apologies in advance. And please let me know if I’ve confused or 
annoyed you so I can make it right. I have no intention to harm you. Help me 
make it right so we can be connected.” This usually works, and the incidents of 
miscommunication have drastically reduced. I understand that that few people 
intend to be unkind, and don’t realize it when they are. But it begs the 
question: how can we all just show up as kind people and accept differences as 
merely interesting instead of challenging?<p>
Willingness to hear diverse ideas. We often assume our communication approach, 
our beliefs, the words we choose, our norms, are ‘the right ones’ and forget 
that these ideas are ‘right’ only for us. What would you need to believe 
differently to willingly listen to ideas that are diverse? <p>
This is a big one for me. As an original thinker I regularly run into people 
eager to dismiss me, unwilling to consider my ideas worthwhile rather than be 
curious enough to consider them. Recently, at a think tank filled with lots of 
other smart people, I met a neuroscientist doing research in an area my original 
ideas could enhance and where I know the field is stuck. When I offered one of 
my new ideas, he called me a liar, saying my ideas were impossible (after I’ve 
trained it to thousands of people and written books on it). <p>
When our idiosyncratic beliefs keep us from expanding our own knowledge base, we 
are not only harming ourselves but those who could benefit. Not to mention the 
world is restricted by the biases of those with the loudest voices and most 
acclaim along the lines of conventional thinking. <p>
Curiosity. Our curiosity is biased by what we already know. It’s not even 
possible to be curious about something we know nothing, and therefore we 
restrict our sense of wonder. The best we can do is have our ears attuned to 
noticing when we hear something ‘new’ or ‘different’ or ‘odd’ and ask questions 
about it. The worse we can do is what too often happens: turn the other person 
off or put them down, preferring to be ‘safe’ with what we know. <p>
It’s been quite ‘curious’ to me that when I tell others I’ve invented a new form 
of question (Facilitative Questions), a new form of training, or coded the 
physiology of change, I get disparaging looks, eye rolls, a derisive comment, 
and no curiosity. Seriously? Just imagine if I’m telling the truth! Consider the 
years folks like Da Vince, or Van Gogh, or Tesla had to struggle to get their 
new ideas accepted. All those wasted years we could have been learning from them 
while they were alive.<ul>
	<li><b>Willingness to learn and change</b>. This goes with curiosity. It’s about ego, about 
being smarterbetterrighter. One of the issues here is that our thinking follows 
the 1,000 trillion synapses in our brains that carry our existing behaviors and 
ideas. When confronted with something unusual, our brains automatically recruit 
existent synapses that don’t even know how to hear anything different and they 
automatically resist. But it’s possible to develop new pathways with new ideas. 
We just need to recognize when we don’t know something so we can have an 
eagerness to learn.</li>
	<li><b>Willingness to be wrong and apologize</b>. This is a hard one. So many people need 
to be right. The only thing they get from that is staying in place, finding 
friends just like them, and restricting anything new that might cause 
disruption. We need to be humble. And yet we staunchly defend our ‘rightness’ 
rather than be wrong. This serves no one.</li>
	<li><b>Humility</b>. What a concept. As an Aspie, I have no choice but to be humble. As 
soon as I see a quizzical look, or an annoyed face, I assume I’ve done something 
wrong. It’s about my brain, and I hate harming anyone, but I’ve primed myself to 
notice so I can take responsibility. Unfortunately, the people who need to be 
right, better-than, and smarter-than assume I have an agenda, or I ‘have no 
humility’ or ‘who do you think you are anyway’ syndrome. Feeling superior feeds 
their ego I suppose so they can continue telling themselves they’re wonderful. 
Unfortunately, this restricts their own lives and potentially harms others. Who 
would you be if you lived each moment with humility?</li>
	<li><b>Authenticity</b>. So who are you? No, really. Are you willing to show up as you are? 
To get it wrong sometimes? To stand up for yourself? To be honest and 
vulnerable? As an Aspie, I live this way because frankly, I have no choice. But 
maybe you shouldn’t either. Maybe we all should show up as ourselves, with no 
pretention, no shield. What would you need to believe differently to be willing 
to really show up?</li>
	<li><b>Equality</b>. One of the things I’ve learned as a Buddhist and practicing Quaker is 
that we’re all the same, but responsible for different things. We all want 
health, happiness, respect, love, friends, a roof over our heads, safety, 
success for our children, enough money to live comfortably and eat, good work 
and a little bit of fun every now and again. I used to date a FedEx driver. I 
earned in a day what he earned in a year. Our professions, life experiences, 
education, cultures, certainly didn’t match. But he was a brilliant woodcrafter, 
had the kindest heart I’ve ever experienced, and a knowledge of music that was encyclopedic. I learned a lot from him. We were equal. Humans, each doing the 
best we can. What would each of us need to believe differently to see worth and 
value in all others? </li>
	</ul>
<p>Imagine if each of us show up in each interaction authentically. No need to 
compete, or exhibit better-ness. No need to be right or smart. No need to be 
richer or more. Just people working, communicating, learning, growing, loving, 
creating together. I offer these givens:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Connect not compete </li>
		<li>Questions not answers </li>
		<li>Listening not talking </li>
		<li>Responsibility not blame </li>
		<li>Yes not no </li>
		<li>Understanding not indifference </li>
		<li>Respect not derision</li>
		<li>Compassion not malice </li>
		<li>Acceptance not dismissal </li>
		<li>Possibility not risk</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
What would you need to know or believe differently to be willing to show up 
authentically, with each communication partner a potential friend, leader, or 
role model, and each communication an opportunity to make the world a better 
place? To recognize everyone as having value, not as Other. It’s time to begin. 
Now. The world, our lives, depend on it.<p>
