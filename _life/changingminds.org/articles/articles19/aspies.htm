How Aspies think, Why We Do Weird Stuff, and Why We’re Important</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine being in a strange country where you don’t understand the mores – and 
aren’t aware you don’t understand them. Say, waiting for scrambled eggs to show 
up for breakfast in Tel Aviv (They eat salad for breakfast.), or saying a 
friendly “Hi” to young indigenous men in the jungles of Ecuador, wondering why 
they then followed you in a pack (Looking into a man’s eyes means a woman is 
ready for sex.). </p>
<p>The events can be interpreted by both cultures. But in the case of Aspies, 
we’re sort of stuck: you NeuroTypicals (NTs) make the rules. And they are crazy.
</p>
<h2>DIFFERENT STROKES FOR DIFFERENT FOLKS </h2>
<p>As an Aspie, my internal rules, my assumptions, my responses, are different 
from a NTs. My perception of what’s going on is in a different universe. I hear 
metamessages primarily, content secondarily, and I respond according to what the 
Speaker intended rather than what my (biased) ears interpret. I think in systems 
and experience the world in wholes, in circles, in patterns so I experience 
entirety, not segments of sequences. </p>
<p>From my vantage point, NTs – largely thinking sequentially, in a horizontal 
world that compares everything against a biased norm - make rules that fit a 
standard I cannot fathom. Yet somehow, with the majority of humans on the NT 
scale, there’s agreement that those rules make sense. They don’t. </p>
<p>Why should I reply “Fine, thanks. How are you?” when someone asks how I am? 
It’s a real question, right? Does that mean they don’t want to know? If they 
don’t care, why did they ask in the first place? And how did it get agreed that 
a meaningless exchange is an authentic greeting? I’ll never understand. </p>
<p>Why am I labeled inappropriate when I respond to something differently than 
‘expected’? Who says NTs are the ones who understand accurately? Maybe my 
references and responses are the correct way of seeing and NTs are just 
following herd thinking. Maybe my references and responses are a great ‘add’ to 
a conversation that expands the scope of the subject. </p>
<p>Why am I the one being too direct? Why aren’t you being more honest? </p>
<p>Why am I the one who’s deemed too intense? Why are you so superficial? </p>
<p>I recently watched my 7 year old friend throw a small toy across the room 
where his four younger sibs played on the floor. Stop throwing that, said Dad, 
afraid the little ones might get hurt. My friend again threw the toy. Stop, or 
I’ll take it away, said Dad. Again, the toy went across the room. Give me that. 
No more toy. </p>
<p>I said to my young friend, “Your dad was afraid the toy might hurt your 
brothers and sister. What were you hoping to accomplish by throwing that toy?”
</p>
<p>“I wanted to understand how it was spinning.” </p>
<p>“So next time, tell Dad what you want to do and he’ll let you go outside to 
throw it.” </p>
<h2>THINKING IN SYSTEMS LEADS TO MORE CREATIVITY </h2>
<p>My Aspie brain perceives a wholly different culture from the world of NTs, 
with expectations, referents, assumptions, thinking systems, rules, and 
different interpretations. I personally have a wholly different understanding of 
what’s happening – a difference that enabled me to develop new models for 
conscious choice, so different from making unconscious decisions from long-held 
biases and assumptions. Indeed, I have devoted my life to unraveling, (de)coding, 
each step of unconscious systems to make them conscious so everyone can make 
congruent choices – and then making the new thinking understandable and usable 
by others in books and courses. </p>
<ul>
	<li>I recognized that the sales model merely places solutions, overlooking the 
change issues involved when anyone seeks to resolve a problem but faces the 
challenges of the status quo. I invented Buying Facilitation® 35 years ago to 
enable sellers to lead people through what happens when they want to fix, and 
possibly buy, something (13 stages), changing the process from placing solutions 
to the real focus of helping buyers buy. (Note: I realized that selling doesn’t 
cause buying.) Obviously I annoyed the hell out of the conventional sales folks 
who fight to find and engage buyers when my model does it in 1/8 the time while 
using values of Servant Leadership. </li>
	<li>Because of the way I listen I clearly recognize the gap between what’s said and 
what’s heard. I developed a road map so people can hear each other without bias 
and wrote a book on it. Annoyed the hell out of conventional communication 
specialists and those pushing Active Listening (only based on words, ignoring 
intent).</li>
	<li>It was obvious to me that people made decisions via their unconscious patterns 
and habitual neural pathways, without being able to get their conscious to 
recognize their full set of choices. To resolve this - a problem for coaches, 
sellers, doctors, parents, etc. - I developed a new form of question 
(Facilitative Questions) that facilitate others through to conscious, 
values-based, permanent change. Sure irritated a whole bunch of coaches who 
truly believe that their questions (based on their ‘intuition’ – little more 
than biased judgment), assumptions, and information sharing choices are accurate 
while wondering why their clients don’t call back.</li>
	<li>I noticed that people seeking to change behaviors and end habits effecting their 
health, had trouble keeping their changes because they tried modifying historic 
synapses (not possible, but easy to generate new ones) that merely directed them 
down well-worn rabbit holes. So I isolated the elements in the brain that can be 
consciously managed to generate wholly new synapses/pathways to generate real 
change. I then developed an online learning model for learners to create new 
synapses and consciously generate new behaviors during the program (i.e I eschew 
habit change based on behavior change.). Boy, that bothered conventional change 
agents, doctors, coaches, who pose questions based on ‘habit change’ and 
Behavior Modification – neither of which can possibly work given the way the 
brain is structured: it&#39;s not possible to change behaviors by trying to change 
behaviors.</li>
	<li>Seemed obvious to me that pitching information to new learners would only reach 
those already in agreement with the information, as no brain pathways/synapses 
agree to something new – especially as it&#39;s presented per the biases, word 
choices, communication patterns of the speaker, possibly eluding the beliefs of 
another. So I designed a wholly new way to train that enables learning, 
according to the learner’s own unconscious rules and values. Certainly annoyed 
folks teaching presentation skills and sales folks. </li>
	</ul>
<p>Thinking in systems has made my life rich with creativity. I have the ability 
to translate, and develop models to scale, how brains make decisions and how 
systemic change occurs. And while I&#39;ve trained my models to sales folks and 
leaders in global corporations for decades with highly successful results, I 
continue to be judged negatively against the norms of the NT world. One noted 
neuroscientist said my thinking, my models are not possible, although he never 
asked what they&#39;re comprised of. Somehow, &#39;different&#39; goes with &#39;aberrant&#39; or 
&#39;eccentric.&#39; </p>
<p>How, I wonder, does the world change unless the outliers like me instigate 
radical change? You can’t do that from the middle. And if more NTs were willing 
to be curious, look through a different lens, it wouldn’t take people like me 
decades to instill productive ideas. </p>
<h2>RIGHT VS WRONG </h2>
<p>So that brings me to my question: How do Aspies end up being the ones who are 
wrong or on the wrong side of normal? I’ve been shunned at invitation-only 
conferences of author-colleagues (when I was the only one with a New York Times 
bestseller), ignored at parties, thrown out of events (by very, very famous 
people), not invited to an event every other person at the table was invited to 
– and invited in front of me, while I was the one person obviously, 
meticulously, excluded. </p>
<p>Why? Because my ideas, my speaking patterns, are different? Because they 
challenge the norm? Why isn’t that exciting? Or fun? Or interesting? </p>
<p>Geesh – I show up in nice clothes, I’ve got a respected professional 
reputation, I speak well, wrote a bunch of books and train global corporations 
in my original models. So I guess I’m a bit smart. I don’t harm anyone, have a 
decent personality, am generous and supportive. I’m even funny. </p>
<p>And yet. And yet, I say ‘wrong’ stuff, and tell unseemly stories when my 
brain references something that others don’t reference. And instead of going 
‘Cool Beans!’ ‘That was interesting!’ Or ‘That was weird, SD. Where did your 
brain go on that?’ My work gets overlooked, although it can make an important 
difference in several fields – sales, healthcare, coaching, management, 
leadership. What rules am I breaking that aren’t worthy of curiosity? Or kind 
acceptance? Or humor? Or excitement? </p>
<p>I heard a comic once ask why men were the ones in the wrong for leaving the 
toilet seat up. Why wasn’t the woman wrong for leaving it down? Same toilet 
seat. Up. Down. What makes one wrong? </p>
<p>The good news about Aspies is that we’re often pretty smart. Because we think 
in systems and can see all aspects of something (NTs think sequentially and miss 
whole swathes of real data – the reason Aspies often think NTs are dumb.), we 
often are the innovators, the visionaries, who notice, invent, code stuff 
decades before academics or scientists. Yet folks like Tesla, and Cezanne die 
without their work having relevance. I read that the only painting Cezanne ever 
sold was to Matisse who wanted to study the painting to learn how Cezanne did 
what he did. Why didn’t others recognize Cezanne was to be learned from rather 
than derided? Why is the easiest route the one that ignores, avoids, derides?
</p>
<p>I was running programs for internal sales folks at Bethlehem Steel. After a 
year of working successfully with Dan at their Sparrows Point, MD group, I was 
being handed over to the Burns Harbor MI group. Dan invited the new manager to 
lunch to meet me as a hand over. We all spoke for a bit of time, and as I got up 
to go to the restroom, I heard the Burns Harbor manager say to Dan, “Is she 
always like this??” to which he replied, “Oh yes! And you’ll learn to love her.”
</p>
<p>In these days of more openness and a real desire to accept minorities, to 
communicate and live without bias, maybe it’s time that Aspies are acknowledged 
as well. Maybe when NTs hear someone say something that’s a bit off the mark, or 
rattle on about a topic that’s interesting albeit a bit long winded (We get SO 
excited by our topics!), maybe they can just say, ‘Hm. Sounds like an Aspie. I 
wonder what I can learn here. I wonder if I can be curious about something new.’ 
Then we, too, can have a voice. And just maybe we can become a welcome addition, 
add our two cents, and maybe make the world a better place because of our 
differences. Just sayin’. </p>
