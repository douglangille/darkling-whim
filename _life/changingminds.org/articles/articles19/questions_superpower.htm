Questions: the new superpower</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Alexa, Siri, Google, and all programs that answer questions and have mechanisms 
that determine the answers. If you’re like me, you largely assume they are 
accurate, without us knowing the reference material or checking further. We 
actually do this in our daily lives – pose questions to friends, colleagues, and 
clients, about stuff we’re curious about, and receive responses we don’t check 
for accuracy or congruence. <p>
Have you ever wondered what a question actually is? Conventionally, questions 
are posed to elicit a response, to gather data from a Responder, like “How many 
children do you have?” or “Why are you doing that?” Parents and spouses 
sometimes use questions to point out insufficiencies or annoyances, as in 
“Didn’t you notice the dishes haven’t been done?” Sometimes we use them 
rhetorically to demand fairness in the world, like in “Why is this happening to 
me??” Sometimes questions are deemed ‘closed’, like in, “What time is dinner?” 
Sometimes they’re ‘open’, like in, “What do you want to eat?” But there is a 
unifying feature to all conventional questions: questions are biased by the 
needs of the Asker to elicit data from the Responder, with the assumption that 
our questions will extract the information we intend. <p>
Of course, most of the time, conventional questions work just fine. How else 
could we find out how many acres there are at Machu Picchu, or which movie our 
spouse wants to see?<p>
But I believe we are underutilizing questions. I believe it’s possible for 
questions to serve a higher purpose - to collect accurate data, of course, but 
also to help others discover their own answers and path to decision making and 
change. What if it were possible to use questions to actually lead people 
through their unconscious discovery process to uncover their own best answers – 
without any bias from the Asker? <h2>
WHAT QUESTIONS DO</h2>
<p>
There is a reason questions don’t necessarily unearth accurate data. Using 
uniquely chosen words and an outcome biased by the curiosity, needs, and 
assumptions of Askers, influencers extract a restricted subset of data from 
Responders, all answers being some degree removed from the complete set of 
available responses. Indeed, questions impose limits that often have some 
percentage probability of missing the mark, being misunderstood or interpreted 
badly. There are several reasons for this.<ol>
	<li><b>Information</b>: because information is elicited by the needs or curiosity – the 
bias - of the Asker, real answers may not be captured. The wording, the request, 
the topic, the intent, and/or the vocabulary may offend or annoy, given 
differences between the Responder’s and Asker’s beliefs, communication skills, 
and lifestyles. </li>
	<li><b>Listening</b>: words and meaning are merely our brain’s interpretations of sound 
waves that enter our ears through our unique neural pathways, guaranteeing we 
understand what’s been said as per our unconscious biases. Obviously, we often 
misunderstand or misinterpret the intended message and potentially miss the 
intent of the question entirely. I wrote an entire book on this (What? Did you 
really say what I think I heard?. Given these natural biases, it’s likely that 
what we think we’ve heard is some degree off of what was intended. Read my 
article on this: We don’t know how to hear each other. </li>
	<li><b>Biased question formulation</b>: Askers use words that will hopefully elicit good 
data for a specific goal and outcome, and may not elicit the best responses. 
Sadly, it’s possible that more accurate answers could have been retrieved with a 
different wording or intent. </li>
	<li><b>Restriction</b>: questions restrict answers to the boundaries of the question. 
You cannot uncover data you never asked for, even if it’s available. You cannot 
elicit accurate data if the question is heard differently than intended. If I 
ask you what type of summer shoes you wear, you’re not going to explain the foot 
surgeries you’ve had. </li>
	</ol>
	<p>
Are you getting the point here? Questions are biased by the Asker in several 
ways, with so much bias built in it’s a miracle people communicate at all. And 
the Responder? Well, a Responder is at the mercy of the question.<p>
This is especially disturbing in coaching, healthcare, and leadership 
situations. Well-meaning professionals believe they’ll instigate a truth from a 
Responder, exposed by the ‘right’ question; or that the Other will discover the 
‘right’ answer if they search their brains in ‘this direction’. Every coach and 
leader I’ve met deeply believes in their own knack – ‘intuition’ - for posing 
the ‘right’ question because they have a history of similar situations and 
‘know’ where another’s answer most probably lie. <p>
Yet we all have examples where these assumptions have proven false. Sometimes 
the influencer has control issues and doesn’t trust the Other to have the 
‘right’ opinions or ideas and believes they know more; sometimes they pose 
biased questions that elicit incorrect data, or worded in a way that unwittingly 
creates resistance to the assumptions built into them. And sadly, when they’re 
certain their questions are the right ones, blame Responders who don’t comply, 
or respond with ‘bad’ or ‘wrong’ or ‘deceptive’ answers. And worse, patients end 
up keeping bad habits, clients end up not making needed changes, buyers end up 
not getting what they need.<h2>
A NEW FORM OF QUESTION</h2>
	<p>
As someone who has thought deeply, and written, about the physiology of change 
and decision making for decades, I began pondering this conundrum in the 1980s. 
I wondered if questions could be used for something other than eliciting 
information and instead could direct Responders through their brain toward 
taking congruent action. What if the intent of the Asker was to facilitate 
Others in discovering their own route to change with no bias, no ego, no 
personal needs from the Asker for a particular solution – only the trust that 
Others had their own answers and merely had to discover them? <p>
What if healthcare professionals asked questions that triggered patients to 
positive, immediate habit change, or coaches knew the exact questions that 
enabled new habit formation and behavior generation? What if scientists and 
consultants could elicit the most accurate information? And imagine if it were 
possible for questions to help advertisers actually inspire action and sellers 
to generate Buyer Readiness. <p>
What if a question could be worded in a specific way to act as a GPS to lead a 
Responder through a sequence in their brain to unearth the accurate data? To 
make it possible to discover the full set of criteria to make a decision from?
<p>
I’m going to get a bit wonky here, so hang with me because what I discovered is 
not obvious. I began studying neuroscience to learn how to sequence the elements 
involved in personal, systemic change. I recognized that before anyone would 
make a change, they’d need to make sure it was congruent with their beliefs. One 
way to get there is to traverse – or be led - through to the appropriate memory 
channels or value or data set they needed to consider, and use their own 
memories, their own beliefs, their own goals, in their own words, to be able to 
make a change congruent with who they were. It would be necessary for Askers to 
change their criteria from having answers to being facilitators. <h2>
FACILITATIVE QUESTIONS</h2>
	<p>
I eventually came up with a new form of question that I labeled a Facilitative 
Question. It uses specific words, in a specific order to go to the most 
appropriate memory channel in the right order to enable discovery without 
resistance; it includes time; it’s’ neutral; it limits the scope of response so 
it avoids elements that might spark defense or feelings; it has no bias, and the 
Asker cannot know the answer; there is no challenge to the underlying status 
quo. They’re quite different from conventional questions, and I’m happy to 
discuss more fully should anyone wish to speak with me about them. <p>
With these questions, prospective buyers can be led through change and buying 
stages; coaching clients can discover their own path to resistance-free change; 
doctors can elicit behavior change in patients rather than push to try to cause 
change; and advertisers can trigger interactive responses to normally one-sided 
push messages. They<ul>
		<li>unlock the means to help Responders discover their own excellence;
		</li>
		<li>are non-manipulative and non-biased;</li>
		<li>offer change agents a new skill to elicit real change without resistance;</li>
		<li>eschew information exchange and adopt real servant leadership; </li>
		<li>enable Responders to solve their own problems and be ready to change.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
Here is a simple example:<ul>
			<li>How would you know if it were time to reconsider your hairstyle?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
This Facilitative Question (FQ) begins by expanding the viewing range to the 
full set of possibilities (i.e. ‘how would you know’), does not challenge the 
status quo (i.e ‘if it were time’), enables the consideration of possible change 
without demanding it or threatening the system (i.e. ‘reconsider’), and limits 
the area of analysis to a bite sized chunk so the brain isn’t overwhelmed (i.e. 
‘hairstyle’). And used in the sequence of how decisions get made (my book Dirty 
Little Secrets discusses the 13 sequenced steps that all change decisions must 
traverse), this type of question leads the Responders brain to action. In fact, 
each FQ demands some form of action when responded to.<p>
A conventional question posed to cover the same area might be:<ul>
				<li>Why do you wear your hair like that?</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
This conventional question challenges the Responder and attempts to elicit data 
for the Asker’s use, causing a defensive response (a reply would start with 
‘Because’) and keeping the person in a very small, idiosyncratic, and personal 
response range which may end up not being about hair at all, but might send the 
person back to a fight with their mother 30 years prior, or a defense against 
their boss, or whatever. And while the Asker is most likely attempting to elicit 
a response they can ‘sell’ into, they are out of control. FQs actually define 
the parameters and give Askers real control. <p>
One of the skills needed to formulate FQs is listening for systems, listening 
without bias. When we listen with biased ears, we will only hear what we want to 
hear, or what our brains are set up to hear neurologically. When we can listen 
without bias (read my book What? Did you really say what I think I heard? on 
this topic) we can hear where the person is along their change cycle and where 
exactly to pose the next question (again, the 13 steps to change and decision 
making applies here). A new skill set, a new set of outcomes, and the real 
belief that everyone has their own answers. <p>
A bit of caution: sometimes people use my examples of FQs and change words, 
change the sequence, and change the intent. In other words, use a bit of what I 
suggest to, again, formulate a question to get what they want to get. In other 
words, it won’t be a FQ. FQs truly demand the Asker give up the need to be the 
change agent, have or seek &#39;the answers&#39;, or be in control.<h2>
USES</h2>
				<p>
FQs direct people to the exact spots within their brain – the most appropriate 
synapses and memory channels - where their accurate answers reside, in the 
proper order the brain can use them to consider making a change that’s congruent 
with their lifestyle, while creating an interactive situation. Here’s a few 
examples that could benefit from FQs.<ol>
					<li><b>Healthcare</b>: Intake forms that create an interactive doc/patient experience 
from the start:What would you need to see from us to know we’re on your team and 
ready to serve you? [This FQ automatically creates a WE space between patient 
and provider.] </li>
					<li><b>Advertising</b>, for an ad for a Porsche, for example: How would you know when it 
was time to buy yourself a luxury car? [This FQ makes the ad interactive and 
gives a reader time to reflect on personal change.] </li>
					<li><b>Sales</b>: What has stopped you until now from resolving your issue using your own 
resources? [This FQ enables potential buyers to look at how they’ve gone about 
solving a problem on their own – necessary before realizing they can’t fix the 
problem themselves and might need to buy something.] </li>
					<li><b>Coaching</b>: What would you need to see or believe differently to be willing to 
consider new choices in the places where your habitual choices are more limited? 
[This FQ gives clients an observer viewpoint, thus circumventing blame, to 
notice old habits/patterns, and limits viewing to the exact historic behaviors 
that may not be effective.] </li>
					</ol>
					<p>
The examples above are merely of single FQs. For most change it’s necessary to 
formulate a sequenced set of FQs that lead a Responder through their own 
congruent steps of change. These can be used in advertising and marketing 
campaigns; healthcare apps that sit on top of Behavior Mod apps and facilitate 
new habit formation; AI where apps or robots need to understand the route to 
change and decision making. I’ve been teaching it in sales with my Buying 
Facilitation® model for 40 years and companies such as DuPont take it into the 
field for their farmers to use, Senior Partners at KPMG use it with client 
consulting, Safelight Auto Glass uses it to compete against other distributers, 
and Kaiser Permanente uses it to engage seniors needed supplemental insurance, 
to name a few.<p>
If anyone would like to learn the HOW of formulating Facilitative Questions, I 
developed a primer in a FQ learning accelerator. Or I can teach you the full 
skill set. Or we can work together to develop or test a new initiative. Given 
how broadly my own clients have used these questions, I’m eager to work with 
folks who seek to truly serve their client base.<p>
By enabling Others to discover their own unconscious path we not only help them 
find their own best answers but act as Servant Leaders to decision making. What 
would you need to know or believe differently to be willing to add a new 
questioning technique to your already superb questioning skills? How would you 
know that adding a new skill set would be worth the time/effort/cost to make you 
– and your clients - even more successful? Should you wish to add the ability to 
truly serve others, let me know.<p>
