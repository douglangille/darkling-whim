Sales as a Spiritual Practice</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
With untold millions of sales professionals in the world, sellers play a role in 
any economy. While our jobs are nominally to place solutions, we are uniquely 
positioned to make a difference: as the intermediary between clients and 
providers, we can make sales a spiritual practice and become true facilitators 
and Servant Leaders (and close more sales).<p>
The current sales model is a time-waster, restricts success, and is horribly 
inefficient. We close 5% of our sales and waste 95% of our time (approximately 
130 hours a month per seller); our product data is well-represented online so 
pitches based on product details may be irrelevant; we connect with only those 
who are ready to buy, and ignore the possibility of facilitating and serving 
people en route to becoming buyers but quite ready to heed, or respond to, 
conventional ways of responding to sales situations.<p>
Until people have figured out how any new solutions will infiltrate, change, or 
disrupt their environment, they will merely attempt to fix their problems 
themselves and avoid any outside intervention. It&#39;s only when they know exactly 
how to manage change and not end up in chaos, when they understand that the cost 
of bringing in something new is lower than the cost of maintaining the status 
quo, will they seek help through a purchase. People don&#39;t want to buy anything, 
they merely seek excellence and will buy if they must. And the sales model does 
not address this, using the time and connection to try to place solutions 
instead. Hence the 5% close rate and wasted time.<p>
Indeed, the time we spend pushing solutions rather than helping buyers 
facilitate their change process is misplaced, mistimed, and misguided, leading 
to the win-lose quality of sales: sales becomes a product/solution push into a 
closed, resistive, private system, rather than an expansive, collaborative 
experience between seller and buyer wherein both attain a win-win. And we end up 
seeking and closing only the low hanging fruit - those ready to buy at the point 
of contact – unwittingly ignoring others who aren’t ready even though they may 
need our solutions, or just need to get their ducks in a row before they’re 
prepared to make a decision.<p>
Imagine having a product-needs discussion about moving an iceberg and discussing 
only the tip. That’s sales; it doesn’t facilitate the entire range of hidden, 
unique change issues buyers must consider – having nothing to do with our 
solutions - before they could buy anything. We enter later than we need to in 
both sales and marketing. Failure is built in.<h2>
IS SELLING PREDATORY?</h2>
<p>
Sellers aspire to niceness and relationship; yet their restricted focus on 
placing solutions all but insures that kindness, respect, and true facilitation 
are unwittingly overlooked. A major factor is our one-sided communication:<ol>
	<li><b>Prospecting/cold calling </b>– driven by sellers to gather needs/information and 
offer solution details (all biased by the need to place solutions). It ignores 
the full enigmatic fact pattern of the buyer’s environment and change issues and 
touches only buyers seeking THAT solution at THAT time at THAT period of 
readiness, omitting those who could buy if ready or knew how to include the 
solution congruently into their current plans.</li>
	<li><b>Content marketing </b>– driven by the seller to push the ‘right’ data into the 
‘right’ hands at the ‘right’ time according to their biased interpretations of 
‘right’, but really only a push into the unknown and a hope for action. Wholly 
seller-centric.</li>
	<li><b>Deals, cold-call pushes, negotiation, objection-handling, closing techniques, 
getting to ‘the’ decision maker, price-reductions </b>– all assuming buyers would 
buy if they understood their need/the solution/their problem.</li>
	<li><b>Real communication </b>involves both Sender and Receiver being equally served; 
sellers can expand their communication to help buyers traverse their private 
change management issues, thereby facilitating Buyer Readiness AND closing more 
sales. Win-win. </li>
	</ol>
	<p>
I’ve been a seller, trainer, consultant, and sales coach since the 1970s, been a 
buyer as founder of a tech start up 1983-1988, and have personally worked with 
dozens of global corporations and untold thousands of sellers. I see sales as a 
near-predatory job: sellers spend their time seeking and following, pitching and 
positioning, networking and calling to find those few set up to buy something, 
and ignoring a large population of potential buyers who merely aren’t ready.<p>
The model is fraught with guesswork and hope, manipulation and persuasion, white 
lies and exaggerations – not to mention highly ineffective when the time spent 
vs sales closed ratio is examined. Not only are we wasting time pushing/chasing 
folks we’ve deemed prospects (A real prospect is one who WILL buy, not someone 
who SHOULD buy; the current sales model doesn’t know the difference.), but the 
global nature of staffing patterns and decision makers in our client&#39;s 
environments causes closing to take 30% longer. And the very nature of the web 
makes most pitches and presentations moot. In fact, buyers often know more than 
sellers.<p>
Sales unwittingly ignores the real problem: it’s in the buying, not the selling. 
The sales model&#39;s focus on our products (terrific as they are) keeps us from 
using our positions as knowledge experts and Leaders to facilitate buyers down 
their own path to excellence.<h2>
SALES IS SHORT-SIGHTED</h2>
	<p>
Indeed, the job of ‘sales’ as merely a solution-placement vehicle is 
short-sighted.<ol>
		<li>Buyers can find our products online. They don’t need us chasing them.</li>
		<li>Our solution isn’t the problem – it’s the buyer’s behind-the-scenes timing 
and change management process that gums up the works.</li>
		<li>80% of prospects will buy our solutions (but not necessarily from us) within 
two years of our connection.</li>
		<li>The lion’s share of the buying decision (9 out of the 13 step decision path) 
involves buyers traversing internal change with no thoughts of buying anything 
until there’s consensus.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
But we can truly serve clients AND close more sales, by adding a Change 
Facilitation capability that expands our entry points into the buy cycle, makes 
the buying decision process much more efficient and makes sales a spiritual 
practice. Here’s my definition of ‘spiritual’:<ul>
			<li>the whole is greater than the parts;</li>
			<li>we’re all here to serve each other;</li>
			<li>no one has an answer for someone else. </li>
			<li>Different from sales, which</li>
			<li>purpose to be win/win but often is ‘win-lose’,</li>
			<li>believes the parts might be greater than the whole,</li>
			<li>causes buyers to feel pushed with content and contacts,</li>
			<li>considers their solution the ‘right’ answer,</li>
			<li>only addresses the tail end of a larger (and unknowable to outsiders) system 
of rules, internal politics, relationships, and status quo. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
To elaborate:<h3>
Aspiring to a win-win</h3>
			<p>
Win-win means both sides get what they need in equal measure. Sellers believe 
that placing product or resolving a problem offers an automatic win-win but 
that’s not wholly accurate.<p>
Buying isn’t as simple as choosing a solution; buyers first must resolve the 
entire system that created and maintains their problem (problems never occur 
uniquely). The very last thing they want is to buy anything, regardless of their 
apparent need. As outsiders we can’t know the tangles of people and policies 
that hold the problem/need in place. The time it takes them to design a 
congruent solution that includes buy-in and change management is the length of 
their sales cycle. <p>
If we enter first as Change Facilitators and help buyers efficiently traverse 
their internal struggles (that we can never be a part of per se), we can help 
them get to the ‘need/purchase’ decision more quickly and be part of the 
solution – win-win. Note: buyers need to congruently manage their change issues 
anyway. They will do this with us or without us, so it might as well be with us. 
Currently we’re not involved because this occurs before they recognize a need, 
or haven’t gotten consensus, or completed their change work yet.<p>
We’re wasting a valuable opportunity to share this process with them by only 
wanting to sell – and then wait and hope, while competitively chasing after 
those who show up after they’ve completed their internal work without us. If we 
enter earlier, work with them as Change Facilitators (with wholly different 
skills and goals) to help them facilitate their change, we can spend our time 
capturing and serving more real prospects, and spend less time seeking out the 
low hanging fruit. We can use our time more profitably to develop real buyers, 
rather than fighting to find those who are ready. Let’s shift gears and enter 
earlier with a different hat on.<p>
Believe it or not it becomes a very efficient process and great time saver: no 
more chasing those who will never close; no more turning off those who will 
eventually seek our solution; no more gathering incomplete data from one person 
with partial answers. We can enable those who can/should buy to buy in half the 
time and sell more product - and very quickly know the difference between them 
and those who can never buy. Win-win. [All the change issues buyers must address 
are in my book Dirty Little Secrets].<h3>
The whole is greater than the sum of its parts</h3>
			<p>
There are several pieces to the puzzle here.<ul>
				<li>The buyer and the system the buyer lives in, including people, policies, job 
titles, egos, relationships, politics, layers of management, rules, etc. that no 
one on the outside will ever understand and are focused on excellence, not on 
buying anything. It’s never as simple as just changing out the problem for a new 
product; their focus is to have the best situation possible and will buy a 
solution only when they’re certain they can’t fix their own problem.</li>
				<li>Resolving the problem needs full internal buy-in from the system before being 
willing to change (i.e. buy) regardless of the efficacy of the fix. A purchase 
is not necessarily their best solution even if it looks like a fit to a seller.</li>
				<li>The ability of the buyer to manage the disruption that a new purchase would 
incur on the system, people, and policies. A fix, or purchase, might be worse 
than the problem.</li>
				<li>The seller and the seller’s product may/may not fit in the buyer’s environment 
due to idiosyncratic, political, or rules-based issues, regardless of the need.</li>
				<li>The purchase and implementation and follow up that includes buy-in from all 
who will experience a potentially disruptive change if a new solution enters and 
shifts their job routines.</li>
				<li>The sum of these parts is the whole; seller and buyer can work together to 
facilitate systemic change first. Surprisingly, this is a very quick process, 
uncovering real prospects almost immediately. Win-win for all.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>
We are all here to serve each other</h3>
				<p>
Sellers understand enough about the systems in our areas of expertise to help 
buyers traverse their change route that could lead to a sale. With an entry 
point of systems excellence rather than solution placement, buyers immediately 
recognize the benefits from a collaboration and are happy to invite sellers onto 
their decision team and not seek other competitors. Win-win. The Facilitative 
Question I developed for Wachovia’s Small Business Banker’s cold calls helped 
prospects immediately realize a problem they had to resolve rather than say ‘No’ 
to an appointment request:<p class="quote">
“How are you currently adding banking resources to the bank you&#39;re currently 
using for those times you seek additional support?”<p>
With no disrespect, no push, no information gathering or asking for an 
appointment, the Facilitative Question merely pointed them to the problem they 
might have to resolve over time. The results were astounding: against 100 
prospecting calls and a control group: 10% appointments vs 27%; 2 closes in 11 
months vs 19 closes in 3 months; we facilitated discovery immediately and 
served. And we expanded the universe of buyers by repositioning the parameters 
of purchase and only visited those who could close.<h3>
There is no right answer</h3>
				<p>
Sellers often believe that buyers are idiots for not making speedy decisions, or 
for not buying an ‘obvious’ solution. But sales offers no skills or motive to 
enter earlier where buyers are not at the point of even knowing if – let alone 
what – they might buy. We must expand the definition of a buying decision (a 
term I defined in 1985) to include
the route down the 13-step path from the status quo through to congruent change. 
Includes the people, policies, relationships, and history – the systems issues 
that insure Systems Congruence – that maintain the status quo and must be 
addressed before they consider buying anything.<p>
Once buyers figure out their congruent route to change, they won’t have 
objections, will close themselves, and there’s no competition: buyers are the 
ones with the ‘right answer’; sellers facilitate change management first and 
then sell once everything is in place. No call backs and follow up and ignored 
calls. Win-win.<h3>
No one has anyone else’s answer</h3>
				<p>
By adding decision facilitation, everyone focuses on uncovering the right 
questions. Collaborative decisions get made that will serve everyone.<p>
Let’s change the focus: instead relegating sales to a product/solution placement 
device, let’s add the job of facilitation to lead buyers through to their own 
type of &#39;excellence&#39; through the mire only they can understand: let&#39;s Lead using 
our industry knowledge. Then buyers make better, quicker, more congruent 
decisions – with more/quicker sales, less tire-kickers, better differentiation, 
and no competition, and sales close in half the time.<h2>
THE NEW WAY</h2>
				<p>
As a seller and an entrepreneur (I founded a tech company in London, Hamburg, 
and Stuttgart in 1983), I realized that sales ignored the buying decision 
problem and developed Buying Facilitation® to add to sales as a generic change 
management tool. Buyers get to their answers eventually; the time this takes is 
the length of the sales cycle. Once I developed this model for my sellers to 
use, we made their process far more efficient with an 8x increase in sales – a 
number consistently reproduced against control groups with my global training 
clients over the following decades.<p>
With Buying Facilitation® we can add a new capability and level of expertise and 
be a part of the decision process from the first call. Make money and make nice.<p>
We no longer need to lose prospects because they’re not ready, or cognizant of 
their need. We can become intermediaries between our clients and our companies; 
use our positions to efficiently help buyers manage their internal change 
congruently, without manipulation; use our time to serve those who WILL buy – 
and know this on the first contact – and stop wasting time on those who will 
never buy. Let’s stop merely trying to place our solutions, and use our 
knowledge and care to serve our buyers and our companies in a win-win. Let’s 
make sales a spiritual practice.</p>
