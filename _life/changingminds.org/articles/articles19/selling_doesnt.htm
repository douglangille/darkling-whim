Don’t You Realize Selling Doesn’t Cause Buying?</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until relatively recently, the United States Post Office (USPO) was a 
universal communication hub. It delivered birthday greetings and Dear John 
letters (For you youngsters, those were break-up notes – like you use text these 
days, only nicer.). It transported legal letters, work agendas, and Christmas 
gifts. It was how we moved information and communication between people and 
places. </p>
<p>Now we use the internet and social media for most of our communication. And 
the USPO? It became a relic of a time never to return, used now to send 
commercial ads and fliers, inundating us, invading us, with the originator’s 
needs to push data, separate from our need to utilize it. Superfluous to our 
lives, we discard these, even if the products they’re introducing are 
respectable. </p>
<h2>SALES NO LONGER NEEDED FOR BUYERS TO BUY </h2>
<p>The sales model is drifting down the same route. Until relatively recently, 
sales was universally accepted as a support and service model, representing 
expertise buyers needed. Sellers used their skill and product knowledge to help 
resolve problems; prospects actually sought meetings to get help figuring out 
how to improve their environments. And certainly, sellers knew their competition 
well and positioned themselves accordingly. </p>
<p>Those standards no longer apply. People can now choose our solutions without 
any involvement from us: much of the information buyers need is immediately 
accessible online - our websites, content marketing, and outreach efforts 
thoroughly explain our offerings, making a seller’s product knowledge 
expendable. Outside agencies – Google, social media - rate us independently, 
without our input, enabling customers to share their experiences of our 
products, accuracy aside. Our global competitors are at our door, at the touch 
of a button and shipped in days, often with lower prices. Buying decisions get 
made amongst large groups of stakeholders, some residing in other countries, 
often with no direct involvement with day to day operations and certainly well 
outside our scrutiny or touch points. </p>
<p>The sales model as we’ve known it has gone the way of the USPO – largely 
irrelevant; buyers now have a more extensive buying decision path that defies 
our standard practices, guaranteeing much is out of a seller’s control. And yet 
we continue using the same prism to sell through, the same techniques we used in 
earlier times, even though our closing rates, now less than 5% for face-to-face 
and 0.0059% of tech-based sales, consistently decline. Our decades-long focus of 
placing solutions merely finds the low hanging fruit. Here are some sales 
techniques we use that are problematic to the buying experience: </p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Pushing, offering, promoting content is secondary</b> until all the right people 
are on board there&#39;s agreement they can&#39;t resolve the issue internally, and any 
change issues/downsides that a new incoming solution will cause are addressed. 
Constant receipt of our marketing outreach becomes annoying and we’re blocked 
and ignored, regardless of the efficacy of our solutions.</li>
	<li><b>Gathering information is useless if offered before all stakeholder agreement</b>. 
Our questions, biased by our need to match what we guess might be their 
requirements to our solutions, have little relevance to the complexities of 
their problem (that we cannot fully understand, as outsiders) and the 
intricacies of what a chosen solution must include. People buy only what is 
agreeable to the full set stakeholders (who we can never know, as outsiders); 
resolving their problem is secondary to staying stable or they would have 
resolved it already. Net net, they won’t have accurate answers to our questions.</li>
	<li><b>Our research into demographics and need doesn&#39;t necessarily find buyers</b>. Sure, 
we can uncover ‘target markets’ that would have a propensity to be buyers. But 
they’re not opening our correspondence and not open to connecting until they are 
ready, willing, able to become a buyer - someone who has addressed all 
complexities of bringing in a new solution and has gotten agreement from all 
internal stakeholders. Continuing to base our research and dissemination on our 
product assures we only close the low hanging fruit. Because a buying decision 
is a change management issue before it&#39;s a solution choice issue, we can add the 
ability to facilitate buying to our goals and reach/convert a larger number of 
prospects.</li>
	<li><b>Our ‘conversion’ rates are based on a small percent of the total population of 
would-be buyers</b>, yet we use these to try to convince ourselves that our efforts, 
our resources, our cost expenditures are relevant. We are not converting 
potential buyers who haven’t yet become buyers but who will buy once they manage 
their change. But they are easy to recognize and convert if we shift our prism. 
Indeed, I’m always curious what those ‘conversion’ numbers represent. Who we 
seek to ‘convert’ is merely a percentage of those who will/can eventually buy (I 
hate to keep saying this, but the low hanging fruit.) We miss over 80% of those 
who will eventually buy: they don’t heed our messages. When you see conversion 
percentages, ask how much of the potential buying population is being 
represented. Current conversion numbers are specious.</li>
	<li><b>The focus on ‘understanding needs’ is necessary only once buyers understand 
their own needs</b> – at the end of their change processes: finding a route through 
to stability among the stakeholders and company/personal norms (Is the 
disruption from bringing in a new solution worse than living with the problem?) 
is paramount to buying anything. Until that’s resolved, they will not buy due to 
potential disruption. If you woke up tomorrow and decided you wanted to move, 
the first thing you’d do would NOT be to buy a house. You’d discuss with your 
family, looking at all sides from each perspective, organizing the full set of 
criteria that would keep the family stable first. A seller’s historic ‘need to 
understand’ (especially when using questions biased by our need to place a 
solution) is moot: until all stakeholders are on board with the specifics of how 
adding something new will affect them, there is no defined ‘need’, a seller’s 
biased questions aside.</li>
	<li><b>Our push to make an appointment is stupid</b>: who is the person we seek to meet 
with? Why are they taking the time to meet with us? Does this person represent 
ALL stakeholders or just the few trying to push internal change? How does the 
person we meet with present our data to others? And at what point in the buying 
decision process? We’re so busy following the norms of selling that we haven’t 
stopped to think this through. We get rejected for an appointment not because of 
our solutions, but because they haven’t yet gotten the full Buying Decision Team 
onboard, because they’re still trying to fix the problem themselves, because 
they haven’t determined if it’s worth an external fix due to the disruption that 
might result. Looking through our biased prism of placing a solution, sellers 
aren’t looking at the entire picture that people must address en route to 
resolving a problem. </li>
	<li><b>We have a faulty assumption</b> that our solution, data, convincing strategies, etc. 
will capture a buyer. What is it about the horrific close rates that isn’t 
registering? Why do we continue to believe if we just have better, faster, 
improved, advanced content dissemination that we will sell more when it’s a fact 
that we’re closing less? Why do we continue to assume that with great data, the 
‘perfect’ solution, people will buy because WE think it will match what WE 
consider to be their need? And why is a 5% close rate (i.e. a 95% fail rate) 
acceptable? Isn&#39;t is obvious there is a problem? </li>
	</ul>
<p>Everything about the selling effort is skewered to finding ways to place our 
solutions. But we miss the bigger opportunity: we can use our time, our skill, 
to facilitate Buyer Readiness. That means, leading people through the confusing 
stages they must – must – manage before they are buyers, before they have needs, 
before they know if, when, what they’ll buy. We wait on the sidelines while they 
go through this process; the sales model is not set up to influence this. </p>
<p>I have watched, over the past 35 years, as sales has drifted closer to my 
beliefs as it attempts to take into account the buying decision and the buyer. 
But because sales continues to consider buyers ONLY in relation to placing 
solutions, sales only reaches the low hanging fruit: people in the process of 
considering how to manage disruption will not have interest (yet) in our 
content. We haven’t accounted for the entire fact pattern of what goes into a 
buying decision (i.e. need, problem resolution, and product choice are the final 
considerations) and overlook the largest portion of buyers: those who will buy 
but aren’t ready yet. </p>
<p>People really don’t want to buy anything, they merely want to resolve a 
problem. And the problem is so much bigger than purchasing something. It 
involves </p>
	<ul>
		<li>getting all – all – the stakeholders and influencers identified and on board 
(often not obvious); </li>
		<li>trying to find a fix for the problem that’s familiar, and minimally disruptive;
		</li>
		<li>stakeholder agreement that the cost of a fix is smaller than the cost of 
maintaining problems (not always obvious) and that they need to go outside for a 
solution; </li>
		<li>recognizing/managing the challenges of melding something new as it replaces the 
old (not always obvious). </li>
		</ul>
<p>People issues. User issues. Tech issues. Human issues. Culture issues. All 
unique. As outsiders we can never understand the totality of what’s going on. 
And yet until all internal factors are managed to assure the least disruption, 
they are not even buyers. It’s only when they are out of options AND get buy in 
AND manage potential fallout, do they become buyers. Making our solutions the 
focus relegates us to being noticed by those at the end of their change process 
- order takers - and robs us of our ability to enter at a stage that helps them 
become buyers. </p>
<p>Indeed, buying is the last thing people and groups do, and only then when 
there is agreement that an outside fix is their only option and have figured out 
how to manage fallout from bringing in something new in a way that avoids 
disruption. You can’t buy a house without family agreement, regardless of how 
wonderful the house or how big the need. You can’t bring in a new CRM system 
unless the users are on board and are willing to use it, unless the tech folks 
know how to incorporate it into what they’re already using, until they’ve tried 
to fix what they’ve got, until a user training is developed and scheduled. It’s 
not about the house. It’s not about the CRM system. It’s about the change 
process. </p>
<p>So long as we focus on solution placement, we will only find those who have 
figured it all out. We could be helping them by shifting our focus to first 
connect via managing their change. Instead, buyers do all this change stuff 
without us as we wait and call and hope and call and send and hope and wait. </p>
<p>The sales industry has finally figured out that success has at least as much 
to do with ‘buying’ as it does selling. But it continues to use the prism of 
placing solutions even here: it has not gone so far as using new skill sets that 
help buyers manage the change (which is a necessary precursor to buying and has 
nothing to do with our solutions, or needs, at all - i.e. no info gathering, no 
understanding of needs, no information pitch, presentation AND no attempt to 
influence or strategize the final elements (i.e. money) perceived as reasons for 
buying. We begin contact by facilitating the REAL buying decision factors.). </p>
<h2>SALES HAS A VERY LIMITED SCOPE </h2>
<p>For goodness sakes, it’s time to stop focusing first on placing solutions. 
Why not help those who WILL buy be ready! And believe it or not, once we take 
off our &#39;selling&#39; blinders and use a prism of facilitating the steps to change, 
it&#39;s quite easy to use a different skill set to recognize people who WILL buy on 
the first call. For this we enter with a different type of question 
(Facilitative Question) and a different goal: to recognize those who seek change 
in the area we can support them in. </p>
<p>Buying is a change management issue, not a solution choice issue - a process, 
part of systemic change, not an event. People become buyers only at Step 10 of a 
13 step decision process that addresses the elements of recognizing and managing 
change. Until this is complete, buyers can’t buy and we are wasting a valuable 
opportunity to facilitate them, of entering earlier where we are now ignored. 
Let’s recognize that due to the complexity of change, selling doesn’t cause 
buying: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Our information, website, marketing materials – information – is terrific. 
Our brand is well positioned, and quality. But from online sales we’re closing 
0.0059%. We don’t know why site visitors come to our site. Our wonderful, 
expensive, information-rich, and creative site is not encouraging anyone but the 
low hanging fruit to buy. </li>
			<li>Our sales folks are well trained in content, relationship management, closing 
and pitching techniques. But they’re closing less than 5%. Why is this waste of 
expensive resource ok?</li>
			<li>Our marketing folks know how to target the ‘right’ audience, but less than one 
half of 1% even open our emails.</li>
			<li>The only folks who heed our great content are folks at the point of buying and 
we’re competing with global competitors for the same low hanging fruit. </li>
			</ul>
<p>We have chosen to sit back and wait while they go through their 
non-solution/buying-related steps. But we can enable Buyer Readiness. The sales 
model as we’ve known it is insufficient as a stand-alone model. It&#39;s a Tier 2 
model. Think about this: </p>
			<ol>
				<li>People don’t want to buy anything-- they merely want to resolve a problem 
and the last thing they do is bring in something new. People live in 
environments – systems, if you will – and try to resolve their own problems. It 
is ONLY when they cannot, AND they have the buy-in from the full set of 
stakeholders AND can manage any change that a new solution would incur, that 
they are willing to make a purchase. 
				<p>When sellers push solution information before people recognize the 
complexities of the environment they’re seeking to change – they waste an 
opportunity to facilitate change (which has nothing to do with buying anything). 
Again, think of that junk you now get in your mailbox. </p>
				<p>Buyers don’t even notice our content it until they seek out a solution that 
will match the intricacies of their buying decision and environment – at the 
point they are ready to change/buy. It will NOT convince them to buy something 
they haven’t yet determined they cannot fix themselves. The last thing they do 
is seek information. In other words, it will be ignored by those you wish to 
reach, no matter how accurate your demographic data. It’s about the buying, not 
the selling. </p></li>
				<li>Until or unless everyone who touches a new solution is on board with 
whatever change will occur with a new solution, there will be no purchase. 
Talking to that one person who claims she has a need does NOT give us the 
necessary information to know what’s going on. We cannot ever know the internal 
dynamics. Ever. </li>
				<li>There is a very specific process that everyone (buyers) goes through 
before they do anything different (change, decide, buy). It involves the 13 
steps to all change, a purchase is a change management decision. The sales model 
only enters at step 10 when it’s agreed by all that the status quo cannot 
resolve the problem and everyone is ready to change. Hence, we do nothing more 
than find the low hanging fruit – and then we all fight over the 5%. 
				<p>The time it takes for everyone who will touch the new solution and processes 
that come from it is the length of the sales cycle. </p></li>
				<li>People become buyers only if they have a route to manage change. The sales 
model overlooks the change management piece of the equation, although sellers 
blame buyers for being ‘stupid’ or ‘not understanding they have a need.’ It’s 
not about the solution or the information or the buying. It’s about change. So 
long as sellers focus their interactions on placing solutions, they will merely 
take orders when people are ready to call in and buy. 
				<p>The folks who use my Buying Facilitation® model enter all new conversations 
seeking who is ready, willing, and able to change. The prism is CHANGE, not 
NEED. Until all the elements of change are managed, people don’t even know what 
their need entails. </p></li>
				<li>Until everyone buys in to change, the environment will prefer the status 
quo; whatever is happening now is baked in to the norm. Need has nothing to do 
with who buys. The prime focus is to maintain the environment. Until they know 
how to do that, they won’t buy, regardless of need or solution relevance. </li>
				<li>We assume that people will understand they need us if we ask the right 
questions and create the right content, and that folks will wake up and notice 
of their need as soon as they read it! </li>
				<li>We restrict our potential buyers to those who seek that specific information, 
overlooking their need to integrate information with unique circumstances, their 
status quo and rules, making much information provided conjecture. Not to 
mention we could easily reposition the way we discuss the content to meet real 
needs. </li>
			</ol>
<p>The sales model was designed to place solutions. That’s it. By entering early 
with a different mindset and skills, we can be closing 40% more sales. </p>
<h2>A WHOLLY DIFFERENT SKILL SET </h2>
<p>I have written extensively, and trained large numbers of global sellers, 
around this issue. In Dirty Little Secrets: why buyers can’t buy and sellers 
can’t sell I introduce a new model (Buying Facilitation®) that explains the 13 
steps all people and groups take (even for small individual purchases) on route 
to becoming buyers. Since the first 9 of them have nothing to do with buying 
anything but with managing change, it involves a different set of skills – 
facilitating the right people through their change to buy sooner. No longer do 
we begin trying to ‘understand’ buyers, or make appointments, push our 
solutions, we first find folks who will become buyers and lead them efficiently 
through their change, and then – only then – offer solution details. </p>
<p>We can’t know anything about the person we’re speaking to. By knowing each 
step of change, we can hear where they are along their decision path. Have they 
collected the full set of stakeholders or are they just beginning? Do they 
recognize the downside to their environment of a purchase? Are they still trying 
to fix the problem themselves? Change is complex. People don’t even understand 
themselves. Here is where we can help. We can facilitate people through the 
steps of change and convert more people into buyers now. </p>
<p>To shift the focus from selling to facilitating change and the buying 
decision process, Buying Facilitation® employs different skills: since our 
normal questions are biased by our needs, I developed Facilitative Questions to 
help Others figure out their own change process; Presumptive Summaries that help 
them recognize what they’re missing in their thinking; Listening for Systems as 
a way to truly hear what’s being said outside of our own biases; and the 13 
steps of change, to lead them through each of the steps they must, must address 
en route to change. The entire process is laid out in Dirty Little Secrets. </p>
<p>It’s not a sales process, but works as the front end of selling to help 
people recognize the elements in their own process that precedes seeking an 
external solution. Because we seek out folks who CAN change rather than seek 
those who SHOULD buy, we enter their buying decision path and lead them through 
each step of change - helping them help themselves. It’s a Servant Leader model 
that facilitates change, not a sales model that influences solution placement. 
It’s a very different mindset. I often ask: Do you want to sell? Or have someone 
buy? They’re two different activities. And sales ignores one of them. </p>
<h2>THE COST OF NO CHANGE </h2>
<p>The sales industry is like one of those buyers we disparage for not 
understanding they need us. Since 1987 when I ran my first Buying Facilitation® 
program at KLM (titled Helping Buyers Buy), I’ve trained about 100,000 sales 
folks, beginning with pilot programs that always ran alongside a control group 
selling the same product. Here’s a calculation of the typical results, 
regardless of industry or price: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>The groups I trained generally close between 6x-8x more than the control 
group.</li>
				<li>Buying Facilitators have a very good idea on the first call who will be a buyer, 
regardless of complexity of sale, eradicating the need to chase folks who will 
never buy and concentrate their time on facilitating the buying decisions of 
those who will.</li>
				<li>Marketing materials are created in stages of information that match the needs of 
each stage of change necessary prior to people becoming buyers.</li>
				<li>Buying Facilitators don’t try to make appointments and yet quickly are invited 
to meet with the full stakeholder/buying decision team.</li>
				<li>Prospects begin trusting sellers early due to their ability to help gather all 
stakeholders and figure out how to resolve the problem internally first.</li>
				<li>Buying Facilitators don’t discuss their solutions, ask needs based questions, 
until people have recognized themselves as buyers, usually in 1/8 the time of 
normal sales. </li>
				</ul>
<p>Kaiser Permanente: went from 110 visits and 18 closed sales to 27 visits, 25 
closed sales. </p>
<p>KPMG: selling a $50,000,000 solution, went from a 3 year sales cycle to a 4 
month sales cycle. </p>
<p>Boston Scientific: had a 53% increase in close rates and a one call close 
rather than months of follow up. </p>
<p>IBM: I personally sold $6,400,000 worth of business as I spoke directly with 
existing clients during the coaching portion of my onsite Buying Facilitation® 
training. </p>
<p>Sales professionals have told me my results aren’t possible. And I agree: 
using the sales model, the beliefs and skills of selling, it’s not possible. </p>
<h2>SALES CAN MAKE A BIG CONTRIBUTION – BUT NOT THE WAY IT’S BEING USED NOW </h2>
<p>With the skills they possess, sellers and marketers can have a vital role in 
facilitating people through their steps of change to becoming buyers. First they 
must understand the differences between selling and buying. Here’s what buying 
entails: </p>
<p>A buyer is someone (or group) who has tried to resolve a problem using their 
own known resources (People never, ever, start out to buy something first!), has 
gotten buy in from everyone who will touch the solution, and knows and manages 
any fallout that the new will cause. A buying decision is a change management 
problem first, a solution choice issue second. </p>
<p>Instead of assuming a buying decision is a solution choice issue and 
continuing as it has for millennia to push content, instead of assuming our job 
is still persuade folks to take action on our content, or place solutions (It’s 
not. It’s to facilitate buying.), sellers can facilitate the folks who CAN/WILL 
buy through the steps of change they must manage – and that we sit and wait for 
them to accomplish. I have written extensively on this. </p>
<hr>
<p>Sharon Drew Morgen is the visionary behind Buying Facilitation® - a change 
management model that includes learning how to Listen for Systems, formulating 
Facilitative Questions, and understanding the steps of systemic change. For 
those of you wishing to learn more, take a look at the program syllabus. Please 
visit www.dirtylittlesecrets.com and read the two free chapters. Consider 
reading it with the companion ebook Buying Facilitation® <p>
</p>
<p>Sharon Drew is the author of the NYTimes Business Bestseller Selling With 
Integrity, as well as 6 other books on helping buyers buy. She is also the 
author of the Amazon bestseller What? Did you really say what I think I heard? 
Sharon Drew keynotes, trains and coaches sales teams to help them unlock 
situations that are stalled, and teaches teams how to present and prospect by 
facilitating the complete buying decision process. She delivers keynotes at 
annual sales conferences globally. Sharon Drew can be reached at sharondrew@sharondrewmorgen.com
