<h1>Communication Competence</h1>

<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="../articles.htm">Guest articles</a> &gt; 
Communication Competence</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today was a typical day. I arrived at my office early in the morning and 
began by checking email: colleagues, fans, strangers writing from around the 
world, each with their own agendas, each email exchange demanding a different 
type of communication. I then went to LinkedIn and connected with new colleagues 
from several countries, answered questions from followers, and added ideas to a 
group discussion. Twitter is always strictly relegated to 10 minutes. Then I had 
several Skype meetings: with a business partner from Paris and her colleague in 
Brussels to consider developing a healthcare app; brainstorming with my tech in 
India; coaching a team of banking reps studying Buying Facilitation® with me, 
and a strategy call with a new client to discuss a leadership implementation 
we’re developing; a brainstorming call with another author of listening books in 
India to discuss ideas for a collaborative article we’re writing. Finally, I 
spoke with a friend, now in London visiting her dying grandmother. I spent the 
rest of the day writing an article, using Google for references. </p>
<p>I suspect your worlds are digitally similar and equally challenging: our 
global interactions include people with ideas, cultural norms and assumptions, 
perceptions, religious beliefs, and languages different from our own. The 
internet has expanded our world. And therein lies the problem. </p>
<h2>WHY IS OUR COMMUNICATION PROBLEMATIC? </h2>
<p>We all take our communication skills seriously. But in this digital world of 
instant connection with people around the globe, our communication skills 
haven’t kept up: we speak from our normalized biases, assumptions, and patterns; 
we listen with our habituated, biased listening filters; we use terms and 
regional communication styles and (very idiosyncratic) subjective criteria and 
reference points. </p>
<p>Sometimes we hear others accurately, sometimes we don’t but think we do. 
Sometimes we unwittingly use terms that annoy, or are annoyed by a Communication 
Partner’s (CPs) terms. I remember once when living in the UK, being insulted 
when someone from London said my house was ‘homely’. Only later did I learn that 
‘homely’ in the UK means what ‘homey’ means in the US, while ‘homely’ in the 
States means ugly. What was meant as a compliment almost ended our dialogue. </p>
<p>Using our established communication skills, we may not know when or how to 
modify our languaging accordingly, or hear precisely what’s intended and face 
the possibility of communicating ineffectively with people outside our 
experience and culture. </p>
<p>It’s time to add new skills for global communication: without knowing when 
what we’re doing isn’t working - listening with a cultural or subjective bias 
that causes an ineffective response, asking what might seem to be pushy, or 
manipulative, or invasive questions, responding according to our own agendas – 
we can only have a restricted set of communication choice points available, 
causing us to respond or connect inappropriately. We need soft skills training.
</p>
<p>Soft skills always seem to be put on the back burner. When I wrote my book 
What? Did you really say what I think I heard? I got calls from several HR 
Directors who wanted to bring in my unbiased listening skills training (just one 
day!), but couldn’t get the buy-in to actually hire me. Why? Because they said, 
everyone thinks they know how to listen. But of course, that’s not true. We 
certainly know how to hear spoken words, but there is no way we can correctly 
interpret them when what we hear is outside our normal references. </p>
<h2>WE CANNOT KNOW HOW ANOTHER’S REALITY DIFFERS </h2>
<p>Finely honed throughout our lifetimes, we all live in a reality of our own 
making, seeing, hearing, and feeling the world uniquely, according to our own 
idiosyncratic, and very unconscious, filters - obviously some degrees removed 
from veracity. Programmed to do this, our brains are pattern recognition 
devices, unconsciously on the lookout for anything (differences, disparities) 
that may challenge our baseline beliefs and status quo. </p>
<ul>
	<li>We hear what others say through biases, triggers, and assumptions that carry 
a modified interpretation of what’s been said through our brain’s habituated 
neural pathways, mistaking or misinterpreting some fraction of the intended 
message: we hear the message our brain wants us to hear regardless of the 
Speaker’s intent. And because our brains fail to tell us what it mangled, 
omitted, or misinterpreted, we actually believe that what we think we hear is 
accurate.</li>
	<li>We feel our emotions through automatic feedback loops that trigger us, via 
normalized and habituated neural pathways, to historic events our brains have 
determined are similar to the current event, objective reality aside.</li>
	<li>Our vision is idiosyncratic and habituated. We each see colors uniquely, for 
example; we remember details according to historic triggers, and our field of 
vision is restricted accordingly.</li>
	<li>We choose neighborhoods and mates who match our beliefs; professions that are 
comfortable in dress codes, values, communication patterns, and culture; even 
our TV choices match our chosen reality and biases. </li>
	</ul>
<p>Sadly, we don’t question our experience. Our brains don’t tell us the level 
of interpretation or modification they’ve automatically chosen for us, nor do 
they tell us when we might be missing something important, expecting something 
that was never promised, or fabricating something never agreed to. And yes, we 
occasionally, unwittingly, hurt others. </p>
<p>Yet we continue doing what we’ve always done, believing our constructed 
reality to be True, believing that our skills are fine, regardless of the 
consequences. Why? By adhering to our subjective reality, we get to maintain our 
core beliefs and cultural norms so we can wake up every day and ‘be’ who we are. 
Our inadequacies, prejudices, mistakes, and viewpoints are built in and 
habituated daily. And we’re comfortable. So long as we stay in our own worlds.
</p>
<p>Obviously, this restricted, biased reality has consequences in our global 
worlds. What happens when we encounter people or situations that are 
sufficiently different from us and our miscommunication causes us to 
inadvertently take a wrong action? What happens when we actually hear something 
inaccurately and act on what we think we heard rather than what was said? [My 
book explains and fixes this: What? Did you really say what I think I heard?] 
What happens when we perceive incoming harm, and it’s merely our unconscious 
biases overreacting? What happens when we misinterpret someone’s intent and miss 
an opportunity for joy? What happens when we consider ourselves successful, or 
content, or ‘right’, and blame another for any confusion? What happens when we 
unwittingly harm another? </p>
<p>What do we lose when we react inappropriately to something we mistakenly deem 
reality? What happens when our livelihoods are dependent upon making accurate 
decisions and having truly collaborative conversations with folks outside our 
normal sphere of influence, and our questions, or listening, or comments, or 
assumptions, go against the norms of our CPs? It’s all unconscious; we may never 
know if something untoward is occurring until it’s too late. </p>
<p>It’s time for soft skills training to be a Thing. Our communication status 
quo is just not good enough in our global worlds. It’s time to get training to
</p>
	<ul>
		<li>enlarge possibility,</li>
		<li>expand our realities, understanding, inferences, and unconscious biases,</li>
		<li>make fewer errors and have more choices,</li>
		<li>hear what’s intended, even when it goes outside of our reality,</li>
		<li>include a new set of triggers, neural pathways, and listening filters,</li>
		<li>have no personal restrictions that could hinder our connections. 
		</li>
		</ul>
<h2>GUESSES AND HABITS </h2>
<p>Often we can’t tell if what we take away from a partner communication is 
accurate when it seems to be fine. Unfortunately, our brains don’t tell us 
they’re hearing, feeling, or seeing something uniquely: it seems normal to us. 
Even those few instances when we notice something seems a bit ‘off’, we’re 
merely comparing what’s in front of us against what we have historically held to 
be ‘true’ and have no idea what is causing the irritation or our part in it, too 
often blaming the other for the problem. And even when we try to understand 
there’s a good chance we can do no better than confirm, misinterpret, or 
disprove according to our own biases, using our own ‘givens’ as comparators of 
‘right’. We are actually projecting our status quo and guessing meaning per our 
past predictions. It’s real if we believe it to be real. </p>
<p>Indeed, there is no intrinsic meaning in anything, outside the meaning we 
give it, making a problem difficult to fix even when we suspect something is 
wrong: the same unconscious, habituated neural pathways that caused the problem 
is restricted when it needs to do something outside of its scope. </p>
<p>By bringing soft skills training to all of our professions, sales folks can 
accurately connect with prospects and customers in other countries, coaches can 
work with clients worldwide and effectively enable self-driven change, leaders 
can run groups and implementations with folks from different countries. Here are 
the programs I believe necessary. </p>
		<ol>
			<li><b>Listening</b>: What we think someone says has been unconsciously curated for us 
by our filters, biases, assumptions, and triggers; we only hear what our 
unconscious wants us to hear. In fact, while our brains sift and insert, they 
don’t tell us what has been misinterpreted or mangled, leaving us to believe 
that what we think we hear is accurate. And we never realize our errors until 
it’s too late. I’ve lost business partners who think something has been agreed 
with without my awareness that anything was proposed.<p>To actually hear/understand what’s meant, we must override our normalized 
listening filters and develop neutral neural pathways to hear through.</li>
			<li><b>Asking unbiased questions</b>: Even with colleagues, the questions we pose are 
indications of what we want which biases and restricts possible responses, and 
can be easily misinterpreted by those outside our culture.<p>Pose Facilitative Questions that direct the brain to specific memory channels 
(i.e. not interrogation devices) to enable others to figure out what THEY want 
from the conversation, disconnected from our needs or guesses. </li>
			<li><b>Managing triggers</b>: We all have unconscious, habituated, normalized triggers that 
are activated automatically with a word, phrase, or idea, causing us to use our 
own subjective values to judge our CPs. With global colleagues it’s especially 
important to unhook our triggers to have effective communication.<p>We must learn to recognize, and make adjustments for, our own triggers and 
biases, and add new triggers to make mutual understanding possible.</li>
			<li><b>Choice</b>: We must learn to choose communication skills that match our CPs skills, 
especially once we recognize a miscommunication.<p>We must know how to disconnect from our habituated responses, listening, and 
general communication styles and build in the cultural norms of our 
communication partners.</li>
			<li><b>Expanding curiosity</b>: Our curiosity is limited by our current knowledge. With a 
global audience, we must expand our curiosity to ask better questions and listen 
accurately.<p>To wonder why a conversation is taking a turn, or not progressing, we must go 
outside of our habituated biases and subjective defenses to recognize problems 
outside our customary thinking.</li>
			<li><b>Negotiating skills</b>: Different countries, different culture groups, have 
different expectations when they negotiate. Learn them.<p>For win-win to occur, both sides must understand the other’s interpretation of 
what is fair, and must supersede acculturated expectations.</li>
			<li><b>Changing beliefs</b>: Our beliefs are the underlying trigger in any communication. 
We need to examine what they are and how they align with our global 
communication partners.<p>Soft skills programs are designed to change behaviors, but don’t cause permanent 
behavior change unless the originating beliefs and norms that created the 
behaviors are modified. All soft skills programs must focus on permanently 
changing beliefs so new neural pathways and triggers are installed.</li>
			<li><b>Gaining empathy</b>: Short of living in a new community for years, the easiest way 
to understand other’s cultures and experience is by reading novels.<p>I recommend James Baldwin, Jane Austin, Toni Morrison, JD Vance.</li>
			<li><b>Writing</b>: Much of our communication is through writing, albeit through our own 
styles that might conflict with a CPs expectations. We need to learn to write in 
more efficient, neutralized ways to ensure we don’t conflict with others due to 
how we write.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
Training must be designed to teach skills for email exchanges, social media 
interactions, proposal and presentation writing. </p>
<h2>CAN I HELP? </h2>
<p>I believe my learning facilitation model is perfect for today&#39;s need for 
enhanced soft skills. I’ve spent my life – since I was 11 – coding the steps and 
skills for unconscious choice and change to enable influencers (leaders, 
sellers, doctors, parents, coaches) to facilitate others through to their own, 
idiosyncratic, systemic, congruent decisions to change; I can use this Change 
Facilitation approach to help people prepare to learn learn, buy, change, 
themselves from their own core, largely unconscious, criteria. Instead of 
outside/in, it&#39;s inside/out. </p>
<p>Used in global corporations since 1987 (first course with KLM titled Helping 
Buyers Buy) I developed this approach when I realized that people cannot respond 
accurately to the type of shared, or experienced, information offered in current 
training modalities (regardless of value or efficacy) due to their own 
habituated filters, biases, assumptions, cultural norms, etc. </p>
<p>As a result, learning occurs in only people who can hear, understand, and 
accept that approach, that idea, that representation. So: offered information is 
automatically biased by a listener&#39;s filters; conventional questions merely 
represent the biases of the Asker and restrict the response framework 
accordingly; and the training approach of a set of data being offered, using the 
languaging, examples, and exercises of the course designers, and may cause 
unconscious reactions or lost learning. </p>
<p>In other words, the only people who will truly benefit from a program are 
those whose unconscious beliefs are already aligned; all those with different 
biases, different beliefs, different assumptions or norms, will not be able to 
hear, understand, abide by, or comprehend the need for, the proposed change and 
may find it incongruent enough to resist. This problem persists not merely in 
training programs, but anywhere outside influencers try to effect change. So 
buyers with a need won&#39;t buy; patients with an illness won&#39;t follow doctor&#39;s 
regiments; coaching clients won&#39;t buy-in to a needed change. </p>
<p>Using my learning facilitation approach, people seeking change can discover 
their own route to their unique learning path, eschew bias and resistance, and 
create their own permanent change where existing choices are found to be less 
than excellent. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve used the training to spearhead permanent behavior change, to expand 
possibility and make new decisions without resistance or bias: sellers can 
facilitate buyers through their change management issues to enable buying; 
doctors can teach patients to make appropriate, permanent behavior changes; 
coaches can help clients buy-in to permanent change; unconscious bias and 
diversity programs can help people get rid of unconscious bias. Here are a few 
of the skill sets that I developed that are different about my training model.
</p>
<p><b>Facilitative Questions</b> – with no bias from the Asker except to 
facilitate congruent change (in other words, not used as interrogation 
vehicles), these questions are designed as directional devices to help 
Responders traverse through their unconscious route to change and discover how 
to change, using their own criteria. They are posed in a specific sequence, 
using specific words, to enable others to figure out their own unconscious 
answers, and actually lead through the steps of congruent change. I know there 
is no referent for these questions. I have trained their formulation to over 
50,000 people, so the skill is learnable and scalable. Please email me to start 
a conversation. To learn how to formulate these, take a look at this learning 
tool. </p>
<p><b>Listening</b> – normal listening merely uses accepted viewpoints to make 
sense of what’s said. Remember: we only ‘hear’ air vibrations that hit our 
habituated neural pathways and are interpreted as per our biases. It’s possible 
to go outside our habituated pathways and listen without bias. To learn more 
about this, read sample chapters of my book What?. If you get excited and want 
to learn how to do this, use the Study Guide I’ve developed that takes you 
through each chapter to shift our normal skills. Or call to have me train a one 
day program for your folks to listen with choice. </p>
<p><b>Choice</b> – we currently make choices according to our own biases and 
norms. I’ve coded the steps of choice and change and can teach people, and 
outsiders (i.e. leaders, coaches, trainers, etc.) to intervene in their own or 
other’s choices at the stage where there is a breakdown, incompatibility, or 
misrepresentation. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve first tested, then offered, this training in global corporations such as 
Morgan Stanley, IBM, Kaiser, DuPont, P&amp;G, FedEx, Wachovia, etc. using control 
groups and pilot studies which consistently found my learning facilitation 
approach 8x more successful than the control group. For those needing a more 
expansive discussion on this, read my paper in The 2003 Annual: Volume 1 
Training [Jossey-Bass/Pfieffer]: “Designing Curricula for Learning Environments 
Using a Facilitative Teaching Approach to Empower Learners” pp 263-272. </p>
<p>So here’s the pitch: when used in training, my learning facilitation model 
does something well beyond conventional training models that use information as 
the route to helping others embrace, adopt, receive, or execute a new idea or 
behavior. I can actually teach people how to change their core choices, and help 
them develop new neural pathways for choice, using their own terms of 
excellence, so they can adopt the new behaviors they choose. </p>
