Initial Resistance: I Only Have 30 Minutes</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: </i>Jon Gilge</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a previous article I discussed one of the most common sales excuses, &#8220;We 
just want the price,&#8221; and how to effectively move past it. Now that you know how 
to handle that one for your benefit and the benefit of your prospects, we&#8217;ll 
turn our attention to another of the common sales excuses, &#8220;I only have 30 
minutes.&#8221; </p>
<p>This time we&#8217;ll also talk more about what causes prospects to resist your 
sales presentation and the sales psychology behind the proper way to respond.
</p>
<p>Does this sound familiar: </p>
<p>Your prospect has agreed to an appointment, you arrive on time, take a seat, 
and then he tells you: </p>
<p>&#8220;I only have 30 minutes for our meeting&#8221; </p>
<p>You know you were clear when you set the appointment that you needed an hour, 
but somehow you find yourself in a situation where you don&#8217;t have the time that 
you know it will take to deliver your value building presentation. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure this has happened to you before, and I&#8217;m also sure that it will 
continue to happen for as long as you participate in the profession of selling.
</p>
<p>How you response to this initial objection will likely define your success or 
failure in making the sale, so you better know how to handle it. When you handle 
this sales excuse incorrectly you will almost guarantee that the prospect will 
be ushering you out the door at the end of &#8220;30 minutes,&#8221; or even worse, not 
returning your phone calls to reschedule if you insisted on finding a time when 
they could spend the full about of time you need. </p>
<p>Before we look at the specific response that Sales GIANTs use to overcome 
sales excuses like this initial resistance, let&#8217;s take a look at what the 
prospect is really saying so that our response is informed by the true intention 
of the prospect and not just the words they are saying. As is the case so often 
in world of selling, there is often a significant difference between what they 
prospect is saying, and what they really mean. Lets find out what this form of 
initial resistance and all other sales excuses really means. </p>
<p>&#8211;<br>
What the Prospect Really Means by Their Initial Resistance. </p>
<p>When your prospect tells you that they only have a limited amount of time for 
your meeting, and especially when this amount of time is less than they have 
agreed to earlier, they are attempting to gain control over the meeting. </p>
<p>And why do they feel the need to offer this initial resistance? </p>
<p>Because they have doubts and anxieties relative to your intentions and the 
way you will conduct the sales conversation. Essentially, because they don&#8217;t 
know if the time they will spend with you will add value to their buying process 
they are seeking to establish a way out of the conversation should they feel 
that an escape is necessary. </p>
<p>Knowing this about their initial resistance, your response strategy is clear. 
You need to move past this initial resistance and get into the substance of your 
conversation where you can convince them that you will add value to their buying 
process and that your intentions are to help them solve their problems. Once you 
can do this, the prospect&#8217;s need for an escape is eliminated, and with it the 
artificial time constraint they put on the meeting. </p>
<p>This is the most common reason that prospects will establish time limits, but 
not the only one. Thus, your response must be designed to handle this scenario, 
and the other two possible reasons that could be motivating this sales excuse.
</p>
<p>The second of those scenarios is that the prospect does have a time 
commitment that may limit the time you have for your conversation, but that 
commitment is a soft commitment. This means that they can get of of it if they 
needed to, and that they would if you can prove to them in the time that they 
give you that your conversation is more important. </p>
<p>The third possibility, and the least common, is that the prospect does have 
something that came up that will take them away from your conversation before 
you have the time that you would like to fully present. </p>
<p>Since you don&#8217;t know which of the three sales excuses you are dealing with, 
your response needs to work with all three. </p>
<p>Respond this way: </p>
<p>&#8220;I appreciate you telling me that up front. I will say that normally it takes 
me longer than that to have a conversation about this product, especially if you 
have questions. I do know that you are eager to take a look at my product and 
see if it can provide you be benefits you are looking for so let&#8217;s go ahead and 
get started. I&#8217;ll work as efficiently as I can and try to finish in the time we 
have. If, for some reason I&#8217;m unable to finish, at the end of the time we do 
have at least you will know enough to make the decision if you&#8217;d like to invite 
me back to finish. How does that work for you?&#8221; </p>
<p>And then you have your normal sales conversation. </p>
<p>The beauty of this response to their initial resistance is that it works with 
each scenario listed above, and just as importantly does not challenge the 
prospect by trying to reschedule the appointment. Despite what some people may 
tell you, this is usually the worst thing that you can do. At best, when the 
prospect does have a real time limiting commitment you will end up back at 
another time, however often in a less advantageous position for not having used 
the available time from your first meeting to establish your value, and for the 
inconvenience to the prospect for having to reschedule. </p>
<p>Trying to reschedule in the first two scenarios is much worse. Since there is 
no real reason to reschedule, you are only making yourself less efficient for 
having to come back, and not improving the conditions of the meeting. The 
prospect will still have the same anxieties that caused them to express an 
initial time resistance, and will find another way to express it. Often, 
however, the rescheduled appointment will cancel because the prospect has lost 
interest or they do not feel comfortable meeting with you without the protection 
of their excuse for not buying. Essentially, you lost the one chance that you 
had to sell the prospect on the reasons for owning your product. With as hard as 
it is to get appointments in the first place, we should never loose them. </p>
<p>Now here is what happens next. </p>
<p>If at the end of the &#8220;thirty minutes&#8221; there was no other obligation (scenario 
1) and you have convinced the prospect of your value and intentions, you 
conversation will continue for much longer that the limited time given to you. 
Hopefully this results in you making the sale. If you haven&#8217;t convinced them 
that you were the right person with the right product, they may take their leave 
using the other obligation as the excuse, which is why they set it up in the 
first place. In that case, you failed to provide a compelling message in the 
time that you had, which should have been enough if the message was the right 
one. </p>
<p>If the prospect has a soft commitment, one that they could get out of, and 
you have convinced them of the importance of what you are selling and that you 
are the right person to solve their problems, they will make a quick phone call 
to get rid of the other commitment and continue on with you. Again, if you 
haven&#8217;t convinced them that your conversation was more important that that other 
commitment, they may take their leave even if they could have moved the 
conflicting appointment. You had your shot, but couldn&#8217;t convince them that you 
were more important than the alternative. </p>
<p>Finally, if they really had another commitment, they will remind you that 
they have to leave, to which you respond: </p>
<p>&#8220;It is that time already? Well then, earlier I mentioned that if we were not 
able to finish in the time you had today, at least you would be able to decide 
if you were interested in having me back to finish our conversation. If that is 
the case, let me know the day and time and I&#8217;ll be back to conclude our 
discussion.&#8221; </p>
<p>As you can see, the response works to overcome this initial resistance in 
each scenario and maximizes the opportunity to get into productive sales 
conversations despite the sales excuses of your prospects.<br>
