<p class="quote"><i>&#8220;If we open a quarrel between the past and the present, we shall find that we 
have lost the future&#8221;<br>
</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; --
Winston Churchill 1874-1965 </p>
<p>Perhaps you have heard the old story of the two people in the car who are 
lost, one asks &#8220;where are we&#8221;? and the response is &#8220;I don&#8217;t know but we are 
making good time&#8221;. </p><p>
As leaders of organizations, we can be lost and yet making good time, until we 
drive our organizations into the ditch if we are not paying attention to the 
direction we are heading.</p><p>
There are literally thousands of companies that had the chance to be successful 
but somewhere along the line their leadership failed to look ahead for 
opportunities and plan for threats to their survival. </p><p>
We must, as leaders know who we are what we are and where we have come from and 
we must know the history of our organization to help us stay successful. Four 
common questions that can help us drive our organizations towards success are 1) 
Where are we going? 2) How are we going to get there? 3) What are we going to do 
when we get there? 4) How we are we going to pay for it?</p><p>
In Greek Mythology the story is told of Daedalus and Icarus who escaped their 
imprisonment by creating wings of feathers held together by wax. They were 
successful in their escape but Icarus did not listen to his father&#8217;s wise 
counsel about neither flying to high nor to low. He flew to high, the sun melted 
the wax and he plunged to his death in the sea. </p><p>
The goal for leaders in any organization is to strike a balance between flying 
too low or too high. If our organization is underperforming the stakeholders 
will exact &#8220;their pound of flesh&#8221; by selling their shares or stakes in the 
company. If the organization is flying high, monies and stakeholders move in for 
a period of time until the stock begins to dive at which time monies move out 
looking for the next high flying stock. </p><p>
Organizations that take the short- term view of their market rather than the 
long-term view can find themselves held hostage by profiteers whose only goal is 
to make money. The goal of the leader in an organization is to make sure that 
the organization not only survives, but thrives as an innovator in the 
competitive world that we live in today. </p><p>
In the global economy that exists today every company is in competition with 
others of its particular industry and its distribution networks and must 
continually be looking forward to the future to anticipate trends and changes 
that will impact their business.</p><p>
Leaders must be able to possess insight and foresight in identifying trends and 
emerging conditions that will impact the very survival of their companies. The 
days of resting on success are over, as there is always another &#8220;up and comer&#8221; 
ready to take advantage of a business opportunity if another company seems to be 
not paying attention. </p><p>
In the technology sector Apple is without peer in innovating new and exciting 
products and devices that everyone wants, if not needs, to use in their personal 
lives and in business. The late Steve Jobs was a person of incredible vision and 
foresight and his products have literally changed the way we work, think and 
view the world. In fact, as you read this article the chances are that you are 
viewing it on a product that Apple has touched or created i.e.iPad, iPad2 and 
now iPad 3. Apple recently passed 25 Billion downloads from its App Store and in 
a recent press release stated that it&#8217;s &#8220;ecosystem associated with its devices 
has created 514,000 US jobs with more than 200,000 jobs in its App business &#8220;. 
Apple is now the world&#8217;s most valuable company with stock prices recently 
closing at $545.18 per share. </p><p>
Five key emerging trends in the technology sector are 1) expansion of internet 
2) the cloud 3) improved computers, 4) Business Intelligence, 5) Virtualization.</p><p>
The internet has far surpassed any expectation of it when it was originally a 
group of computers at different universities sharing information back and forth. 
Today the web is everywhere and continues to grow exponentially. It is the 
subject of governments trying to control it or tax it or censor it in countries 
that are ruled by dictatorial powers. This is the proverbial &#8220;genie out of the 
bottle&#8221; it cannot be placed back in the bottle by any power on earth, at this 
point in time, nor should it be. The internet will continue to grow and will be 
in every aspect of our lives and technology; from turning on our house lights 
remotely with the app on our phone that we downloaded from Apple, to remotely 
turning on our security systems at home to check on the kids. As different 
versions of software are introduced to the market I envision that the internet 
will also move into differing versions i.e. version 1, 2, 3, 4 etc. and will 
eventually be able to harness the power of millions of computers simultaneously. 
This can be hailed as a mixed blessing, as the law of unintended consequences 
with this type of power will surely take place somewhere in the future. </p><p>
The cloud is one of those words that everyone knows what it is but no one really 
knows what is meant by it because &#8220;fuzzy logic&#8221; sometimes gets in the way of 
what we are trying to convey to someone. In realistic terms you could say that 
&#8220;the cloud&#8221; is just another name for the internet and you would be right. If you 
thought that the cloud was the latest and greatest thing since &#8220;sliced bread&#8221; 
you would also be partially right. In basic terms the cloud is a tool to be used 
and mastered presently and in the future, as it is still evolving in IT circles 
by some of the best and brightest minds in the field. We have all used Web based 
services or will eventually use them in personal banking to access our accounts 
and to check our balances. This used to be done at the bank then later the ATM 
machine could give us a balance, now we can check it on our computer or on our 
mobile device that we carry around with us. </p><p>
Personal computers have grown smaller and more powerful through the last ten 
years and in the next 10 years personal computing will be vastly different than 
now. We now are able to talk and video communicate on our computers through 
Skype, ooVoo, and various other programs. We can dictate into our computer 
through programs like Nuance Dragon Naturally speaking; which will have many 
applications for use in the future to help those who are not able to physically 
use a keyboard or choose not to. With the increasing power in computers it is 
not a stretch to see that holographic images will soon be available to the 
general public and not just available on large system commercial machines.</p><p>
Business Intelligence or (BI) as it is commonly known offers an array of data 
that has been synthesized through the common collection device known as the 
computer. Think of the common collection device as a bucket that collects 
rainwater and out of the bucket run several lines to other buckets or storage 
areas. Each of these storage areas could hold various types of valuable 
information for a company that makes business sense when viewed independently. 
One storage bucket could hold performance reviews for employees; another could 
contain information on vendors that the company deals with on a regular basis; 
or information on data mining, statistical analysis, forecasting etc. This 
information if used effectively can allow a business to be better prepared for 
the future of their business and to have a competitive advantage over their 
business rivals.</p><p>
Virtualization can involve taking Business Intelligence information sources and 
having them as a web-based application that can be accessed from anywhere with 
the proper authentication codes and safeguards. There are cost benefits to 
companies using virtualization applications for their operating systems, 
application servers, and hardware applications among others. One of the benefits 
of virtualization presently is that data can be stored securely offsite and 
reactivated quickly In the event of a disaster or a terroristic event. One of 
the questions that arise from these types of off-site storage areas in the 
virtual world is &#8220;Who owns the data and what happens to it if a company wants to 
hold our data hostage&#8221;? These are questions to consider for not only the 
present; but also for the future success of companies who have the foresight to 
be actively planning and taking the long-term view of business and to know where 
they are going. </p>
