<h1>Collaborative Leadership: A Process for Success in a Turbulent World</h1>

Collaborative Leadership: A Process for Success in a Turbulent World</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: James D. Murphy</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you know how to provide collaborative leadership in a disciplined fashion? 
And how does one define disciplined collaboration? The current business and 
leadership literature touts the importance of collaborating in our turbulent 
world. Large and small businesses and teams struggle to wrap their heads around 
just what collaboration is. Many see collaboration or collaborative leadership 
as a challenge that can be met through technology, whether it is through social 
media or virtual conferencing, while others recognize the benefits of 
restructuring an office space so that it appears more open. However, technology 
and physical space are only superficial means to address the challenge of 
disciplined collaboration. Collaboration - and successful collaborative 
leadership - does not derive from &quot;where&quot; or through &quot;which&quot; media people 
interact. Instead, it is about &quot;how&quot; people interact. And that &quot;how&quot; must be 
disciplined. </p>
<h2>Disciplined Collaboration </h2>
<p>Disciplined collaboration holds a central place in Jim Collins' latest work, 
&quot;Great by Choice.&quot; &quot;Great by Choice&quot; is the result of a grand research project 
that seeks to discover how some companies have continued to thrive in spite of 
uncertainty, chaos, and luck - good or bad. It's a centrally-important issue in 
our turbulent world, where change is so rapid and unpredictable. Collaborative 
leadership has been cited as a vital skill that teams and companies must use in 
order to constantly create, innovate and adapt to change. Innovation is often 
seen as the fruit of collaboration; however, this is a dangerously limited 
perspective. Collaboration is much more valuable than a means to achieve 
innovation. Disciplined collaboration is an invaluable process that teams can 
utilize to successfully innovate, solve problems, make decisions, plan and 
execute. </p>
<p>Above all, disciplined collaboration is a creative planning and 
decision-making process. In &quot;Great by Choice,&quot; Collins defines discipline as 
&quot;consistency of action.&quot; For teams and companies, Collins' definition implies 
that collaboration and collaborative leadership processes be consistent. &quot;The 
great task, rarely achieved,&quot; Collins writes, &quot;is to blend creative intensity 
with relentless discipline so as to amplify the creativity rather than destroy 
it.&quot; He goes on to point out that &quot;the signature of mediocrity is not an 
unwillingness to change; the signature of mediocrity is chronic inconsistency.&quot; 
That inconsistency begins in the planning and decision-making process. And in a 
world of complex challenges that are best met by teams rather than individuals, 
that consistency requires a disciplined collaboration process. </p>
<h2>Dynamism and Iteration </h2>
<p>A disciplined collaborative planning process requires certain elements. 
Altogether, there are many elements in a planning process; however, some of the 
elements most successfully impact an effective collaborative leadership process 
-- these are the elements that allow the process to be dynamic, iterative, 
participatory and cognitively diverse. </p>
<p>&quot;Dynamic&quot; refers to the adaptability of the planning processes product -- the 
plan. Change happens; therefore, you shouldn't collaborate on a plan only to 
find that the plan needs to change without a clear process of making those 
adaptations. </p>
<p>The process for disciplined collaboration and collaborative leadership should 
also be iterative. Iteration is similar to dynamism, but is not the same. 
Iteration is the plan improvement process within the overall planning process, 
while dynamism refers to the adaptation of the plan after it is executed. 
Iteration occurs during planning, while dynamic adaptation occurs during the 
execution of the plan. Teams that collaborate during planning, and those who 
utilize collaborative leadership, will iterate the plan before its execution, 
enabling those individuals to more effectively execute and adapt those plans.
</p>
<h2>Nominal Group Aggregation </h2>
<p>Of course, disciplined collaboration requires participation by more than one 
individual - this is what makes collaborative leadership so challenging. How do 
a group of individuals come together to produce a plan or make a decision? 
Fundamentally, it requires a collaborative leadership process for generating 
ideas at the individual or very small group level (2-5 persons), and then 
combining and vetting these ideas at a larger group level (5-15 people). This 
process is called nominal group aggregation. </p>
<p>Nominal group aggregation is a delicate process because everyone has their 
own ideas - some better than others. In collaborative groups, some individuals 
voice their ideas forcefully, while others hold back on valuable insight, 
fearing they won't be heard or appreciated. However, successful collaborative 
leadership techniques can overcome such obstacles, and these techniques must be 
part of a disciplined collaborative process. Disciplined collaboration is not 
about achieving consensus; instead, it is about producing the best plan to 
achieve the objective. Consensus can lead in any direction, while disciplined 
collaboration yields a plan that leads in the right direction. </p>
<h2>Cognitive Diversity and Simplicity </h2>
<p>Finding the correct direction to proceed requires another element of the 
collaborative planning process: cognitive diversity. Collaborative leadership 
will not be successful if you are collaborating with a team of individuals that 
think alike, have similar backgrounds and experience, occupy the same 
hierarchical positions, and so forth. Creativity and innovation require 
divergent thinking and dialogue. Therefore, disciplined collaboration must 
adhere to a process that harnesses cognitive diversity. Utilize your 
collaborative leadership skills to incorporate a balanced mixture of experience, 
knowledge and positions for the collaborative process. Consider that two heads 
are actually not more valuable than one if both heads think alike and see the 
world in the same way. For example, to a hammer, everything looks like a nail - 
so make sure that you have a complete toolbox when planning collaboratively. </p>
<p>There is one additional important element. The process must be simple. To 
collaborate effectively and efficiently, people need a simple process. If a team 
has to spend time organizing and training about how they are going to 
collaborate and then struggle to become proficient at that process, then 
efficiency and effectiveness suffer. Collaborative leadership entails using a 
process that is simple to learn and apply, consistently applying that process 
throughout the organization. Disciplined collaboration will become a 
widely-practiced behavior; and that behavior will ultimately become a healthy 
collaborative culture. </p>
<h2>Achieve Collaboration through Discipline </h2>
<p>Disciplined collaboration yields more than a plan or decision; it engages the 
team to execute successfully. Disciplined collaboration is the first step in 
achieving success as a team. Humans like to be autonomous, to have the freedom 
to solve problems and perform tasks on their own and in their own way. However, 
our complex, turbulent world requires collaboration in order to create, innovate 
and succeed. Humans also need to be connected to each other, to be a valuable 
part of a larger whole. Disciplined collaboration is the key to satisfying these 
often conflicting needs in modern organizations. On one hand, collaborative 
leadership provides each individual with the opportunity to contribute their own 
insights and then, once a final plan is created, to go forth and execute in 
their own semi-autonomous way. On the other hand, what each individual executes 
becomes a well-coordinated part of the overall objective. However, to fulfill 
these basic human needs, the team must always achieve collaboration through a 
disciplined process. </p>
