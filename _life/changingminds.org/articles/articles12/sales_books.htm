<h1>Top Ten Sales Books of All Time</h1>

Top Ten Sales Books of All Time</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Luke McLeod</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This post has been a while in the making. Mainly because it was so hard to 
cull a list down to just 10 books, because there are literally hundreds of sales 
books that offer great advice on how to become a better sales professional. 
Certainly some books offer more than others, although my hope is that this list 
includes those books that are loaded with tangible tips, techniques and 
strategies that will take your sales to the next level. </p>
<p>I also wanted to make a note that some of these books aren&#8217;t directly related 
to sales (meaning they don&#8217;t directly tell you how to ask particular sales 
questions). There are a few books on general communication &amp; mindset. Two 
qualities that, if you want to be an expert sales professional, you must learn 
to master. </p>
<p>So please enjoy! I hope you get as much out of these books as I have. They 
all definitely sit on the Top Shelf in my office.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>10. Swim with the Sharks without being Eaten Alive by Harvey Mackay </h3>
<p>I bought this book for $1 in an op shop bargain bin in the Blue Mountains, 
making it one of best investments I&#8217;ve ever made! And although it is quite old 
(published in 1988) and some of the techniques (stalking your prospect to see 
where they go for drink after work??) and statements (pg 188 &#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s lonely 
at the top, and the bigger they are, the more strokes they need&#8230;) are dated. 
However it does contain some timeless bits of gold that make it worthy for a 
place in this list. </p>
<p>This includes the emphasis Harvey puts on knowing everything about your 
customer/client. Harvey puts forth his &#8216;Mackay 66&#8242;, which is 66 points/questions 
you should know about your customer/client. Yes it is a bit excessive, however 
there are some great questions like &#8220;What do feel is the customers long-range 
personal objective?&#8221; This gets you thinking about a sustainable relationship, 
not just a quick win. </p>
<h3>9. Beyond Yes by Peter Fritz, Allan Parker &amp; Sherry Stumn </h3>
<p>Most of you would not of heard about this book. I would be shocked if even 
the bookworms have heard of it. Written by all Australians, one of which is a 
good friend of mine &#8211; Mr. Alan Parker (so there might be a little bit of bias 
here). It is a fantastic business book that goes into a lot of indirect sales 
territory e.g. networking, communication and negotiation. </p>
<p>One of best pieces of advice I got from it was The Relevance Test. Take a 
look at the people around you. The people you deal with the most. The people in 
your network. Are they the people you need around you to help you achieve what 
you want to achieve? This also applies to your self. Are you relevant to your 
customer or potential client? If not, how can you become so? </p>
<h3>8. The Sales Bible by Jeffrey Gitomer </h3>
<p>This book, on the other-hand, I&#8217;m sure most of you have heard about or read. 
Gitomer has become know as the Guru of sales with his enormously popular series 
of little hard cover books, including The Little Red Book of Selling, Yes 
Attitude &amp; The Black Book of Connections. However The Sales Bible pretty much 
has all the good bits and pieces from all his books combined. </p>
<p>His witty way of writing keeps you engaged and it&#8217;s one of those books that 
you can pick up at any time, open up to any page and grab a bite size worth of 
good sales advice. I know some of you are thinking that the techniques and 
methodology of Gitomer are a bit &#8216;junior&#8217;, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve put it in the back 
end of the top ten. Plus, it&#8217;s always important to keep on top of the basics! 
Smart simple sales basics will always beat confusing and complicated sale 
strategies. </p>
<h3>7. Selling to Big Companies by Jill Konrath </h3>
<p>Who wouldn&#8217;t like having a Fortune 500 company as a client? What I really 
like about Konrath and the way she writes is that she is someone who has &#8216;done 
the hard yards&#8217;. She&#8217;s had to deal with the thousands of rejections and 
knock-backs a successful veteran sales professional inevitably has to go 
through. However, what separates her from other veterans is that she has 
captured where and what she did wrong over her career, creating a step-by-step 
solution for each challenge so it doesn&#8217;t happen again. </p>
<p>The obvious other big plus this book offers (as the title suggests) is that 
Konrath gives you a first hand insight into how she secured BIG deals, taking 
you through a proven process that will give you the opportunity to secure a &#8216;big 
fish&#8217;. </p>
<h3>6. How I Raised Myself from Failure to Success in Selling by Frank Bettger
</h3>
<p>A little &#8216;Old School&#8217; in its techniques and writing (it was first published 
in 1947), &#8216;How I Raised Myself from Failure to Success in Selling&#8217; is a 
pioneering book for the profession of sales. One of Dale Carnegie&#8217;s best friends 
(author of &#8216;How to Win Friends and Influence People&#8217; which is number four on the 
list), Bettger takes you through his life as a travelling salesman, starting at 
his very humble beginnings to the top of a major American insurance provider. He 
breaks his chapters up into a mixture of method and mindset. I really enjoyed 
Part 6 of the book, where Bettger goes into how to deal with failure and 
setbacks. An important know-how if you are going to get anywhere in sales. </p>
<h3>5. Smart Calling. Eliminate the Fear, Failure &amp; Rejection of Cold Calling by 
Art Sobczak </h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve never liked the phrase &#8216;Cold Calling&#8217;. I mean, who really likes the 
cold?? I think they named it that when the first time someone made a &#8216;cold call&#8217; 
they froze. It certainly doesn&#8217;t get me excited and motivated to pick up the 
phone when I hear that phrase. Thank goodness one of the first things this book 
does is ban the use of that phrase, saying that if you think of &#8216;cold calling&#8217; 
then your pretty much setting yourself up for &#8216;stone cold&#8217; failure. You need to 
think &#8216;Smart&#8217; when you&#8217;re planning on picking up the phone to call someone 
you&#8217;ve never spoken to before (hence the book title &#8211; Smart Calling). </p>
<p>The approach Sobczak teaches you is light years away from the painful, pushy 
calls I&#8217;m sure most of you have received from telesales people in the past. It&#8217;s 
client focused, and it&#8217;s about establishing a genuine consultative dialogue with 
potential clients right from the start. Some of the key lessons you will learn 
are: </p>
<p>How to research a potential client in advance so that the call becomes a warm 
rather than cold one<br>
The right words to use in the critical first 20 seconds to grab a prospects 
attention<br>
How to come across as a peer-level professional rather than a cheesy salesperson<br>
How to structure an engaging dialogue that gets prospects to take action<br>
How to stay motivated and avoid morale-sapping rejection<br>
This is by the best book on &#8216;Smart Calling&#8217; I have ever come across. A 
no-brainer to have on your Top Shelf. </p>
<h3>4. How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie </h3>
<p>Another classic! If you don&#8217;t have this in your library then give yourself an 
uppercut. This book has so many vital lessons in business/sales acumen, it could 
almost be named the encyclopedia of proper business ethics. Written mostly in 
parable form, I recommend you buy a notebook and pen to write down the key 
points while reading it (if possible create a model or process for each point) 
and work out how you could implement the hidden nuggets of gold into your own 
daily practices. </p>
<p>I also have this text as an audio book -a trusty companion when I&#8217;m in the 
taxi to see a client. My top nuggets of gold from this book would include: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Be the bigger person and apologise, or admit when you are wrong</li>
	<li>Become more interested in other people, than trying to get people 
	interested in you</li>
	<li>Ask and listen. There are no two ingredients that will build more 
	rapport than these</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Selling to the C-Suite by Nicholas A.C. Read &amp; Dr. Stephen J. Bistritz
</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s not one sales professional I know that wouldn&#8217;t want to know how to 
improve their ability to sell to senior executives. A lot either don&#8217;t know how 
to sustain a meaningful conversation with them, or have trouble getting hold of 
them in the first place. This book takes a refreshing perspective compared to 
most other sales books in that instead of looking at what people did who were 
successful to sell to the C-suite, the book focuses on how senior executives 
want to buy. </p>
<p>Another big plus that I&#8217;m sure the more conservative sales professionals will 
enjoy, is the amount of research that supports all that is written. Read and 
Bistritz have made sure that no advice given isn&#8217;t backed-up by solid research 
and statistics. Lastly, I really enjoyed how they segmented the different types 
of sales professionals (Commodity Supplier to Trusted Advisor). This gives you 
shortcut advice on what you need to do to become part of the elite sales group, 
a Trusted Advisor. </p>
<h3>2. SPIN Selling by Neil Rackman </h3>
<p>Some say this is the book that is credited for making the big shift in the 
way selling was performed. The &#8216;old&#8217; way of selling was all about explaining the 
benefits of your product/service to your customer/client. Trying to make 
yourself and what ever you are selling as compelling as possible and if you get 
any objections, then you have an armory of responses ready to fire back at them 
until they have nothing else say, they either buy what you are selling purely 
out of remorse or excuse themselves to the &#8216;bathroom&#8217;. </p>
<p>Rackman flipped this approach on its head, creating a sales acronym system 
called SPIN. He explains that the majority of your time spent with a new 
client/customer should be asking QUESTIONS about your customers/client current 
Situation and Problems, leaving you spruking about benefits until the very end 
of the conversation (Need-payoff). </p>
<p>The big plus for this book is that is brings STRUCTURE to your selling 
approach. In a market where a lot of sales books talk about their own story of 
success, SPIN is a no-nonsense systematic book that will bring you sales success 
regardless of your position and experience. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>1. The Greatest Salesman in the World by Og Mandino </h3>
<p>With a title like that, it is pretty hard to argue that this isn&#8217;t greatest 
sales book of all time. Some of you reading this may differ with my opinion (and 
that is completely OK), but let me explain my reasons. Firstly a quick overview 
of the book itself. This book is more of a parable about a young man who meets 
an extremely successful businessman/salesman, whom is the farther of the lady he 
has fallen madly in love with. To prove his worth as a fitting match for his 
daughter, the young man pledges himself to the successful old businessman, 
saying he will do all that it takes to gain his approval to marry his daughter. 
Therefore, the wealthy old man puts him on a quest to discover the 10 secret 
scrolls of sales success. </p>
<p>The book then takes you on a journey as the young man discovers these 10 
secret scrolls, each one giving him a new insight in what it takes to be a 
&#8216;successful&#8217; man. The big kicker I got from this was the deep emotional strings 
it pulls. I&#8217;m a big believer that success in sales is about 80% attitude and 
about 20% skill. If you&#8217;ve got the right attitude and mindset, then you&#8217;re 
already on your way to do well as a sales professional. This book changed the 
way I approached sales. In fact, it changed a lot about the way I live my life. 
It not only made me more successful, but also a better person. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve 
chosen it as Number 1. </p>
<p>Well I hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed the list, and as mentioned at the beginning of the 
post, I&#8217;m sure there are many more excellent sales books that could easily have 
made the list. If you&#8217;ve read any other sales books that have made a profound 
difference to your selling ability, please share them in the comments section. 
I&#8217;m always looking for new books to add to my Top Shelf.</p>
