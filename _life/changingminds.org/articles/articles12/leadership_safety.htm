Focus on Leadership and Improve Your Safety Levels</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Ron Horton</i></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the quest to improve safety records, organizations often rely on 
motivational posters, classes or training programs to help teams minimize risk 
and improve safety performance. However, great safety records are not achieved 
through these efforts alone. Improving safety requires leadership - 
organizational leadership at the front lines that is equipped to develop a 
process-oriented and disciplined safety-in-execution culture. The secret is 
training those front-line leaders in a simple, scalable process. The pursuit of 
operational excellence through such leadership training is the key to improving 
safety records. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I have always believed that the most operationally-capable organizations are 
also the safest. Great leadership at the operational level makes organizations 
excellent. And it is that same great organizational leadership that enables 
these organizations to improve safety. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2007, I was the commanding officer of a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. 
That year, our ship won numerous awards, including an award for being the most 
battle-ready aircraft carrier in the Atlantic Fleet, winning prestigious safety 
awards and being selected Ship of the Year. We also won three environmental 
awards and had high retention numbers. We were forward deployed in a time of 
war; yet we achieved the highest safety ratings. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Operational excellence and safety are not contradictory pursuits. They are 
both the product of an obsession for continuous improvement, not in the C-suite 
or boardroom, but where the work is being performed. In the Navy, we call this 
&#8220;deck plate leadership.&#8221; The senior leaders onboard our ship were able to 
improve safety by utilizing organizational leadership and the Flawless 
Execution(SM) methodology - which includes developing leaders, improving 
day-to-day operations and closing execution gaps. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Organizational Leadership: Leveraging Flawless Execution(SM) to Improve 
Safety </p>
<p></p>
<p>Effective organizational leadership relies on creating an environment and 
modeling behavior that is conducive to achieving mission objectives. In order to 
improve safety, leaders must focus on day-to-day operations and closing 
execution gaps by aligning their teams and building trust on a daily basis. If 
you focus on improving the day-to-day basic operations of your organization, you 
will find that your safety records will improve as a result. </p>
<p></p>
<p>There are two principle reasons for this two-fold improvement. First, one 
must plan well before every task, project or undertaking. Planning does not have 
to take a lot of time, but it does have to incorporate all of the right elements 
and be performed in the same disciplined manner every time. Second, teams must 
assess how well they performed once their plan is executed. Did the team 
succeed, fail, encounter new challenges, or suffer a near miss? We call such an 
assessment debriefing. Debriefing is how we learn from doing and how we improve 
every day. Organizational leadership relies on these basic principles to 
maintain operational excellence and improve safety. Without these principles, 
your operations may appear as if they are safe; however, in the long run, you 
are putting your team at risk. </p>
<p></p>
<p>To improve safety, leaders should follow the Flawless Execution(SM) process 
of Plan, Brief, Execute, and Debrief on a daily basis. Leaders must implement an 
organization-wide planning process that is simple and scalable at all levels - 
whether planning at the highest organizational level or for the simplest daily 
tasks. </p>
<p></p>
<p>After creating a plan, leaders should communicate this plan through briefing. 
It&#8217;s important that the leaders brief what they&#8217;re going to do that day. 
Organizational leadership leverages formal briefings to inform participants of 
the plan and to describe each individual&#8217;s roles and actions within that plan, 
developing Situational Awareness and aligning the immediate objective with those 
of the team or organization&#8217;s long-term objectives to improve safety levels. </p>
<p></p>
<p>During execution, leaders must hold individuals accountable via a series of 
short, focused team meetings in which each member is held responsible for 
his/her duties and execution gaps are identified and acted upon - these meetings 
ensure that the team remains aligned and focused. Leaders should establish a 
rhythm of execution that habituates team members to a regular pace of operations 
so that they know when to expect to perform each of the four steps in the 
Flawless Execution(SM) process. That rhythm provides periodic, expected 
organizational leadership intersection points that nurtures the discipline 
needed for both the front-line workers and the deck-plate leaders, which will 
improve safety and operational excellence. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, the debriefing process allows leaders to create trust with nameless 
and rankless debrief sessions in which team members develop lessons learned from 
the execution process. Those lessons learned should be applied to future 
operations. Leaders should also have a conduit to spread lessons learned 
throughout the entire organization, which will improve safety and increase 
performance levels by accelerating the team&#8217;s experience. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Leaders must drive the cultural adoption of this Plan-Brief-Execute-Debrief 
process by applying it to day-to-day operations. Adoption of the Flawless 
Execution(SM) process will effectively close the execution gaps in your 
organization, which will ultimately improve your safety - and your productivity. 
Therefore, effective organizational leadership teaches leaders at all levels, 
the tools, processes and techniques that they need to achieve operational 
excellence. </p>
<p></p>
<h2>Effective Leadership and Individual Responsibility </h2>
<p></p>
<p>It is a leader&#8217;s job to make sure that their team is aligned, and that each 
member is communicating, working towards the same goal and executing in the same 
manner. A great leader does not improve safety by simply watching from afar and 
commanding others. Instead, organizational leadership requires a leader to go 
down to the front lines with his/her team, whether it&#8217;s an oil rig, a paper 
plant, or a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, motivating and aligning 
individuals to accomplish what they&#8217;re supposed to, every day. By aligning 
teams, improving trust, and focusing on day-to-day operations, great leaders 
will close execution gaps and will finally achieve high safety levels. </p>
