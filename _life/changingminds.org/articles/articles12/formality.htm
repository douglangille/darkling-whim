The Importance of Operational Discipline and Formality to Improving Safety in High-Reliability Organizations</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Ron Horton</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was in the U.S. Navy's Nuclear Power Program, I oversaw numerous 
High-Reliability Organizations. High-Reliability Organizations (HRO) are 
organizations which routinely operate and execute in high risk, dangerous 
environments, yet have very few safety incidents or mishaps. In my experience, 
there was one organization that stood out as the &quot;gold standard&quot; - nuclear 
powered aircraft carriers. </p>
<p>Onboard a nuclear carrier, operational discipline and formality, in tandem 
with the construct of the Flawless Execution(SM) model, set a standard of 
improved communication, safety and productivity. As the 20th Commanding Officer 
of the world's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS ENTERPRISE (CVN-65), I 
was privileged to lead a crew and work with a team of over 5,500 people that 
epitomized operational discipline and utilized formality in every process to 
ensure the highest level of safety while achieving operational excellence in all 
facets of operations. </p>
<h2>Defining Operational Discipline and Formality </h2>
<p>Because of my background in high risk operations, I believe high-reliability 
organizations such as organizations in the railroad industry, oil and gas 
industry, energy industry, manufacturing industry, and mining industry, would 
benefit greatly from making operational discipline and formality cultural norms.
</p>
<p>At Afterburner, we define operational discipline as a mindset and commitment 
to strict adherence to standards, processes and rules that govern operations in 
groups or individuals. Operational discipline encompasses multiple operators, 
teams, business units or an entire organization. Operational discipline 
epitomizes professionalism and encompasses what I call formality. </p>
<p>Whereas operational discipline is a mindset or commitment, the dictionary 
defines formality as that strict adherence to established rules and procedures; 
rigidity. Formality is the actionable part of the operational discipline mindset 
and is the mechanism that establishes and maintains forms, rules, processes, or 
customs. Formality is the engine that drives operational discipline from a 
mindset to action. It is through formality in process, and strict adherence to 
those processes, that operationally disciplined organizations are able to safely 
and successfully conduct operations in the high risk arena. </p>
<p>Together, operational discipline and formality determine how individuals and 
teams act, communicate, resolve issues, perform maintenance, back teammates up 
and foster ownership. I believe that very often, the difference between 
successful high risk operations and unsafe operations is in how operationally 
disciplined and formal a team is at following established processes, maintaining 
established standards, and how well they truly embrace a no-nonsense approach to 
execution. Disciplined, formal, no-nonsense adherence to established standards 
and processes, before, during, and after operations is what makes operational 
organizations great. </p>
<h2>Flawless Execution - A Framework for Embedding a Culture of Operational 
Discipline and Formality </h2>
<p>Afterburner's Flawless Execution methodology of Plan - Brief &#8211; Execute - 
Debrief is an operational framework that can provide the formality that drives 
the operational discipline necessary to close execution gaps and prevent errors 
and crises. Teams that are well-trained in the Flawless Execution model have the 
processes that better equip and empower them to work together to develop 
collaborative plans, maintain accountability, seamlessly execute processes, and 
then debrief events to garner lessons learned for the next planning cycle. The 
result is continuous improvement in safety and performance in even the most 
hostile operating environments. </p>
<p>The Plan - Brief - Execute - Debrief cycle is scalable and flexible enough 
that it enables strict adherence to any organization's already established 
processes and procedures. Without such a structured, formal process, teams are 
often unable to create clear, measurable, and achievable mission objectives and 
plans. Mission briefs may be inconsistent, execution tends to be marred by 
communication failures and task saturation, and debriefs either don't happen or 
become inefficient and ineffective. Teams that rigorously adhere to processes 
such as the Flawless Execution Cycle become operationally disciplined and formal 
in action. They also plan better, quickly identify root causes of errors, and, 
therefore, are able to eliminate execution gaps. </p>
<h2>Importance of Formality to Improving Communication </h2>
<p>A process every organization should understand is how to communicate. Whether 
you're performing maintenance or delivering instructions during a stressful 
process, formalized communications can significantly enhance and improve safety, 
execution and productivity. Organizations engaged in high-risk operations should 
consider using precise, simple communications and verbiage for alerts, 
directions and questions. In the fighter pilot world, on bridges of ships, and 
in carrier nuclear propulsion plants, we use a method to communicate called &quot;comm 
brevity&quot; - a simple, efficient, standardized use of terms to give direction 
during execution. </p>
<p>&quot;Comm brevity&quot; is a verbal form of formality in communications. It avoids the 
pitfalls or confusion of using too many words or the use of lingo or slang 
during execution. Many times, errors occur because personnel may not know or 
might not understand what was said or meant by a fellow team member or leader, 
thus causing confusion or improper action. Such communication errors can result 
in unsafe situations, as directions or requests are potentially only 
partially-heard, partially-completed, or go unnoticed altogether. </p>
<p>Standardized communication ensures a team is precise in communication and 
follows a strict, formal process from beginning to end. Other types of 
standardized communication processes may include echoing the original request or 
confirming the request with a formal response. Keywords that have a singular 
meaning can also help direct action and formalize communication. Such simple 
keywords or phrases can be directional or advisory in nature. </p>
<p>By using standardized formal communication, teams and leaders are better able 
to assess when operations are being executed correctly. Teams can also better 
comprehend and assess when problems are occurring, even if the environment is 
distracting or if task saturation sets in. </p>
<h2>How to Utilize Formality </h2>
<p>Operational discipline is essential to following formalized processes exactly 
as dictated - both as teams and individuals. Every high-reliability organization 
is different, and there are many different methods to instilling operational 
discipline and formality in each business unit. What is important is that 
organizational standards are formalized, trained to and enforced. </p>
<p>To accomplish this, some companies may prefer to formally write out their 
standards and then distribute them throughout the company, while others may 
prefer to initially train the front-line leaders on the formalized standards and 
then have the front-line leaders distribute this knowledge throughout the 
organization, both in theory and in practice. However, no matter which method 
you choose, every individual needs to know the processes and procedures, and 
these processes and procedures must be common throughout the organization. When 
breaches in formality or discipline are identified, they must be debriefed and 
corrected, if not immediately, soon thereafter. Individual and team 
accountability are the cornerstones to achieving consistently-successful 
operations in harsh, high risk, unforgiving environments. </p>
<h2>Formalized Standards, Standard Operating Procedures and Issue Resolution 
</h2>
<p>In the world of high risk operations, teams must invest the time to establish 
organizational standards and standard operating procedures. These standards 
govern the behavior and actions of a group or individual and are critical to 
success. </p>
<p>Another important aspect of formality is issue resolution. How do you resolve 
issues in your organization - formally or informally? Do you have a common 
process? How and to whom are issues reported? Are your resolutions documented 
and are you generating and distributing the lessons learned? Are corrective 
actions timely and tracked? How well do you debrief? What will you debrief - 
planned events, unplanned events, or both? What process do you use to debrief? 
At Afterburner, our Flawless Execution debriefing methodology is a simple 
seven-step process called &quot;STEALTH.&quot; The STEALTH Debrief Model, delivers 
explicit, actionable lessons learned, and is a structured, yet simple and 
scalable model that can be used at any level to provide answers to all of the 
above questions. </p>
<h2>Operational Discipline and Fostering Ownership </h2>
<p>A final and important pillar of organizational discipline and formality is 
the fostering of individual and organizational ownership. Passionate ownership, 
at a personal and organizational level, is what makes good organizations great. 
Great organizations that foster personal ownership are deeply rooted in personal 
accountability and responsibility. </p>
<p>Infusing ownership comes down to answering two simple questions: &quot;What is OUR 
standard?&quot; and &quot;How do WE ensure it is being met?&quot; </p>
<p>Once the standard is determined and formalized, we must constantly ask 
ourselves several key questions to ensure we are not missing the mark. Such 
questions might include: &quot;Are we providing proper supervisory oversight during 
key events or evolutions?&quot; &quot;Do our supervisors and leaders conduct proper, 
formalized tours or inspections prior to operations?&quot; &quot;Or are our leaders 
overlooking events or conditions that do not meet the standard, no matter how 
big or small?&quot; </p>
<p>A good indicator of ownership within an organization, good or bad, is how 
detailed the pre-operation area tours are or how inclined team members or 
supervisors are to looking the other way when the standard is not met. Leaders 
and team members just going through the motions, on pre-shift walk-throughs or 
leaders who overlook even the smallest of &quot;below OUR standards&quot; conditions or 
actions are condoning those conditions or actions, which will eventually 
normalize the sub-standard performance. </p>
<p>At Afterburner, our Flawless Execution methodology provides forcing functions 
that help embed operational discipline and formality by teaching leadership 
processes to teams and team leaders. Forcing functions, such as written plans 
developed during the planning process and utilized during execution, help 
maintain accountability and responsibility. Execution of these plans, along with 
standard operating procedures, are tracked and discussed as part of an Execution 
Rhythm, a series of face-to-face meetings that track performance and execution 
through direct interaction with those accountable and responsible. Once your 
personnel are trained on the standards, and operational discipline and formality 
are embedded in their DNA, when the &quot;fog of war&quot; or stressful situations set in, 
they will revert to and maintain the standards you set for them. </p>
<p>Operational discipline and formality are cultural phenomena that dictate how 
employees operate, communicate and execute processes. The Flawless Execution 
methodology, coupled with operational discipline and a strict adherence to 
formalized processes and standards, becomes the winning combination your teams 
need to consistently overcome even the most challenging environments and achieve 
the highest level of safety and productivity in even the harshest playing 
fields. </p>
