Overcome Objections and Close the Sale</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: John Boe</i></p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, the first two orders many new salespeople receive are &quot;Get out 
and stay out!&quot; It is only natural for your prospect to procrastinate when asked 
to make a decision involving money. As a general rule, people are hesitant to 
commit to purchasing a product or service until they have convinced themselves 
that they need it and are assured they are getting it at a fair price. Research 
indicates a prospect will say no on average five times before they actually buy. 
As a professional salesperson, it is important to remember that an objection is 
not a rejection of you personally. </p>
<p>Believe it or not, objections are a good sign and you should actually look 
forward to them. After all, if your prospect was not interested in your product 
or service, they wouldn't be asking questions. Simply put, an objection is 
nothing more than a request for additional information. Top producers not only 
expect objections during the sales process, they actually anticipate them. </p>
<p>Typically, a prospect's objections will fall into four major categories; no 
money, no perceived need, no hurry, or no trust. If you haven't built trust and 
rapport with your prospect, qualified them financially, and conducted a thorough 
needs analysis, you can expect them to use objections to derail the sales 
process. When addressing an objection, don't dump the whole bale of hay. The 
majority of salespeople have a tendency to overwhelm and bore their prospects by 
over educating them. Many salespeople lengthen the appointment and use up their 
valuable fall back positions in an attempt to show how knowledgeable they are. 
Occasionally your prospect's objection may be disruptive and therefore, you 
might want to delay answering it until a more appropriate time. When you make 
the decision to delay your response, I recommend you write their question down 
and ask them, &quot;Would it be ok to address this question later on in my 
presentation?&quot; However, if the same objection comes up twice, you should stop 
and address it immediately. </p>
<h2>Steps for Addressing an Objection </h2>
<h3>Step 1 - Hear them out and write it down </h3>
<p>When your prospect voices an objection, show concern, treat it with respect, 
and hear them out. Interrupting when you should be listening not only presents a 
bad first impression, but it also destroys trust and rapport. Learn to be an 
active listener by giving your prospect your full and undivided attention. Avoid 
the temptation to think about your response while your prospect is speaking. An 
active listener is not only listening to what their prospect is saying, but is 
also trying to discover the meaning behind their words. Research indicates that 
65% of our communication is nonverbal. Therefore, it is vitally important to pay 
attention to body language and listen for voice inflections. In addition to 
observing your prospect's gestures, you must learn to be mindful of your 
nonverbal signals as well. </p>
<p>Before you begin responding to your prospect's objection, it is vitally 
important that you understand their specific concern. Even though you may have 
heard the same objection many times before, you must avoid the temptation to 
begin addressing their concerns prematurely. Otherwise, you run the risk of 
shooting yourself in the foot by voicing an objection they had not even 
considered. I recommend you get in the habit of restating the objection in your 
own words to gain agreement prior to responding. In this step it is important to 
remember that your intention is not to address their concerns, but simply to 
hear them out and write them down without comment. Never argue or even register 
disappointment with their objections, just acknowledge them. It is a good idea 
to take notes and occasionally nod your head affirmatively to let them know that 
you are tracking with them. </p>
<p>Once you have listed all of your prospect's objections, conclude this step by 
saying, &quot;Bob and Mary, if your concern(s) can be addressed to your complete 
satisfaction, at this point, can you think of anything else that might keep you 
from going ahead with this decision today?&quot; If additional objections are brought 
up, add them to the list and ask the question again to gain commitment. 
Obviously, it does not make sense to go to step two if there is reluctance to go 
ahead with the decision. </p>
<h3>Step 2 - Feed it back for clarification </h3>
<p>Feeding the objection back in the form of a question provides your prospect 
an opportunity to expand upon their concern. For example, if your prospect said 
they don't have the money in their budget, you would simply feed it back in a 
nonjudgmental way by saying; &quot;You don't have the money in your budget?&quot; This 
technique greatly reduces the perception of pressure. By giving your prospect 
the opportunity to explain their statement, they will frequently answer their 
own objection. Another good reason to clarify the objection is to make certain 
you are addressing their exact concern and not inadvertently creating a new one. 
Some objections are of greater importance to your prospect than others. A 
prospect will often use insignificant objections in an attempt to stall or delay 
the closing sequence. After you have clarified the objection, ask your prospect 
how important that concern is to them. After all, not every objection is really 
important. </p>
<h3>Step 3 - Answer the objection and &quot;Touch Close&quot; the Sale </h3>
<p>When addressing an objection try to stay big picture, but be prepared to 
provide details upon request. Use graphs, charts, numbers, and or testimonials 
if the big picture approach isn't effective. During this important step, pay 
particular attention to your prospect's body language gestures. Once your 
prospect agrees that their objection has been resolved, let them watch you cross 
it off your list. Continue this deliberate process until each and every 
objection has been resolved. Complete this step by asking, &quot;At this point can 
you think of anything else that might keep you from going ahead with this 
purchase today?&quot; If they say no, proceed with confidence to the final step and 
ask them for the order. </p>
<h3>Step 4 - Ask for the Order and Expect a Decision </h3>
<p>Transition into this step by saying, &quot;Bob and Mary, am I correct in saying 
that it appears you both have convinced yourselves in the merits of this 
purchase?&quot; If you sense the least bit of hesitation, excuse yourself by saying, 
&quot;Bob and Mary, I can tell that you need a moment to discuss this information in 
private, so I am going to get a cup of coffee and give you time to make your 
decision.&quot; This technique dramatically reduces the likelihood of your prospect 
taking the information home to &quot;think about it.&quot; Keep in mind that you may have 
to ask for the order several times before you get the sale; so make sure to vary 
your closing questions. The key to overcoming objections and closing the sale is 
to remain professional and be persistent without becoming argumentative or 
defensive. Knowing how to effectively address your prospect's objections brings 
you closer to their final question, &quot;Where do I sign?&quot; </p>
