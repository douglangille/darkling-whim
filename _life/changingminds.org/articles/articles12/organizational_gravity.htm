Organizational Gravity: Three Steps to Foster Continuous Improvement, Defy Obsolescence and Take Flight</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: James D. Murphy</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gravity can be a wonderful thing. It is an irresistible force that keeps us 
grounded on this big, beautiful, floating blue marble. It is even applicable to 
organizations in the form of organizational gravity. For example, I worked with 
an organization that coined a catch phrase for a challenge beyond its scope of 
control, deeming the situation a &quot;gravity issue.&quot; They explained that &quot;the 
situation is out of our control, much like gravity - you can't do anything about 
it.&quot; </p>
<p>Sadly, this mentality represents the culture in many organizations. Whether 
it's the culture, the hierarchy, the bureaucracy or the processes, 
organizational gravity seems to grow ever stronger as an organization matures. 
Sure, organizational gravity keeps the organization grounded and focused. It may 
also contribute to a passion for continuous improvement at a very tactical, 
discreet level. But, it also narrows that focus at the expense of innovation and 
adaptability, two of the most critical abilities of successful organizations. So 
how do we defy organizational gravity? </p>
<h2>Continuous Improvement Planning </h2>
<p>Every company or organization begins as a plan. Never forget that! Continuous 
improvement planning is the key to defying organizational gravity. It's easy to 
think of everything we do in our working lives as &quot;processes.&quot; For instance, 
your organization probably has a hiring process. However, this is the wrong way 
to look at it. Instead of viewing it as a hiring process, think of it as a 
hiring &quot;framework.&quot; Of course you plan for each and every position that you must 
fill, as every new hire has different strengths and weaknesses. However, many 
organizations still call this a &quot;process,&quot; which evokes the image of a 
manufacturing line. </p>
<p>What about a new project? Any continuous improvement planning in that? Sure 
there is. Large scale projects are unique, even if there are a number of 
processes involved, because in a sense, these projects have never been performed 
before. If you are an entrepreneur pursuing a new business idea, you begin with 
a plan. That plan may be a formal business plan or it may just be an idea 
sketched out on the back of an envelope. Ultimately, with success, those plans 
transform into processes, the sustaining framework of the business -- and that 
is where organizational gravity begins to tighten its grip. As our ideas 
coalesce into plans and the plans further coalesce into concrete processes, 
organizational gravity strengthens and holds the organization together. </p>
<p>It is this necessary and proper transformation from plan to process that, for 
good and ill, perpetuates the relentless assault of organizational gravity. As a 
positive force, we might call it focus. However, the cons of organizational 
gravity include stagnation and paralyzing bureaucracy. How do we balance the 
need to &quot;break the surly bonds of earth&quot; to adapt and innovate in a constantly 
changing environment with the grounded focus of organizational gravity? </p>
<h2>Three Tasks to Defy Organizational Gravity </h2>
<p>Freeing ourselves from the constraints of organizational gravity while 
anchoring ourselves safely in the terra firma of our proven processes takes a 
constant commitment to accomplish three tasks: Always state a clear objective, 
always align every objective to your purpose, and always plan over the process.
</p>
<h3>Have a Clear Objective </h3>
<p>The objective is everything! I often observe individuals and teams charging 
forward to execute a task or project without a clear objective in mind. They get 
caught up in doing without thinking, and if you stop these individuals to ask 
what the main objective is, they would have a very difficult time articulating 
what it is they are attempting to achieve. However, if you ask them to think 
clearly about their objective, they often realize that their approach is flawed 
or even wrong. </p>
<p>Always have a defined objective for even the most routine tasks. This will 
help you think freshly in terms of the continuous improvement process. Consider 
how you will achieve the objective and question whether a given process or 
approach is really sufficient, effective, or relevant. </p>
<h3>The Big Picture Objective: Differentiate the &quot;Why&quot; from &quot;What&quot; 
</h3>
<p>Align to the big picture objective -- the big picture objective refers to 
your purpose, mission, strategy and long-range goals. Simon Sinek, author of 
&quot;Start with Why,&quot; makes this compelling point: Aligning to the big picture 
purpose, or as Sinek puts it, the &quot;why you do it,&quot; is what separates Apple from 
companies that make computers. Making something or providing a service is just 
the &quot;what,&quot; and the &quot;what&quot; may change as the environment or market changes. 
However, the &quot;why&quot; never changes. The &quot;why&quot; helps us look beyond our terrestrial 
existence and the organizational gravity, helping you to re-align to the 
fundamental reasons why we and our organizations get up every morning. When you 
constantly remind yourself of the &quot;why&quot; and align your actions to the big 
picture, you simultaneously free yourself from constraints of process-thinking 
while grounding yourself in the fundamentals of the organization. </p>
<h3>Plan Over the Process </h3>
<p>Third, always plan over the process. The Blue Angels, the U.S. Navy's world 
famous flight demonstration squadron, fly the same show on every performance, 
but the location changes. Do you think that the Blue Angels fly a process? No, 
they fly a continuous improvement plan that they adapt to every different 
location, situation and changing weather condition. Unless you are manufacturing 
the same widget day in and day out, you need to plan over the process. And I 
guarantee that you won't manufacture that widget the same way for too many 
years. Change always happens -- like organizational gravity, it's relentless.
</p>
<p>One can plan over the process by taking the standard process, clarifying the 
present objective, aligning that objective to the big picture objectives and 
fundamental &quot;why&quot; of the organization, and then asking a few questions. First, 
ask what stands in your way - what threatens the successful accomplishment of 
your objective? Second, ask what resources are needed to accomplish this 
objective. Existing processes fool us into making assumptions about threats and 
resources - that they remain the same day-in and day-out. Never assume that a 
process may be followed blindly without considering what may have changed in the 
current context. Instead, plan over the process - never assume a process is 
sufficient in every given scenario. Always perform fresh continuous improvement 
planning by considering new threats and resources and then develop a new course 
of action appropriate to the present context. </p>
<p>Balancing the benefits and limiting tendencies of organizational gravity 
comes down to maintaining a clarity of purpose, approaching every task, every 
project, and every day as an opportunity to conduct continuous improvement 
planning. <br>
