Top Ten Solution Sales Questions</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Luke McLeod</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought I&#8217;d share some of my top questions I ask my prospective clients and 
key accounts. Now I&#8217;ve tried to keep these questions as universal as possible, 
so of course you would want to tailor them a bit to specifically suit your 
service/product (however don&#8217;t go too specific, especially when dealing with 
C-Level executives/Decision Makers, you want to keep it fairly &#8216;Big Picture&#8217; 
orientated). Also I know this list could be a Top 100, however I&#8217;m hoping you&#8217;ll 
share some of your top questions that have brought you success in the comments 
section. For now, here are some questions that have brought me success: </p>
<h3>10. &#8220;What are your key objectives for the next 12 months?&#8221; </h3>
<p>This is a classic leading question after you have asked a few questions about 
the background and current situation of the company. If you are dealing with a 
C-Level decision maker they usually love talking about the future and goals of 
the company. It&#8217;s also a &#8216;Big Picture&#8217; question, meaning that it is quite a 
broad question. However, every sculptor has to find his lump of granite before 
he begins chiseling away at his masterpiece. </p>
<p>Notice I also asked &#8216;your&#8217; not the &#8216;company&#8217;s&#8217; key objectives. Why? Because 
this has made it a more personal question and if they are the decision maker, 
you want to come across as fixing their problems (which are generally going to 
be the company&#8217;s anyway). </p>
<h3>9. &#8220;How do you plan to go about achieving these objectives?&#8221; 
</h3>
<p>(You&#8217;ll notice that a lot of these questions follow on from the previous 
question. This is so I can give you some flow and structure to the questions) 
Everybody loves a plan, although not many people have one. The larger the 
business you deal with, usually the better the plan. However when you ask this, 
most often than not you will receive a nervous look, with a fingers crossed 
response about a plan they hope will work. </p>
<p>What you are listening for in the answer are gaps and commonalities where 
your products/services may be able assist in helping them achieve their 
objectives. Take down as many notes as possible, making sure you circle the 
prominent words and statements they mention. This is vital for when you are 
putting together your recommended solution. </p>
<h3>8. &#8220;What are some of the challenges you think you might encounter in 
achieving these objectives?&#8221; </h3>
<p>A lot of sales professionals would have thought that they had attained what 
they needed to provide a solution from the answer they received to the previous 
question. However, great sales professionals know that their probability of 
securing a deal with increase dramatically if they not only help their customer 
achieve their objectives, but also if they eliminate any challenges, current or 
future, that they are or might experience. </p>
<p>Pain is a by far a greater influencer on making a decision than what pleasure 
is. Although we don&#8217;t like to talk about our problems, once we do or once we&#8217;ve 
realised that there might problems, what do we want? We want them fixed, don&#8217;t 
we?! </p>
<h3>7. What could be the effect/impact if you don&#8217;t address these problems?&#8221; 
</h3>
<p>This is an impact question and I would suggest you tread carefully when 
asking such a question. Depending on the individual they may feel uncomfortable 
answering a question that probes this deep. It also takes them into a mindset of 
frustration and possible anger as they realise what could happen if they don&#8217;t 
address the challenges. </p>
<p>However if you frame the question right and have built enough rapport it can 
give you some powerful content to put in your proposal and presentation. </p>
<h3>6. &#8220;When ideally do you need these problems solved by?&#8221; </h3>
<p>A business problem without a date to fix it by is like a tumor without a set 
date for surgery. You may not be able to directly see it and the effect it is 
having, but it will continue to grow and do damage until it&#8217;s too late to fix.
</p>
<p>Try and get as specific as possible with the date. The more specific the 
date, the more real the problem is. If they say &#8220;Within 6 months&#8221;, what are they 
going to say if you ask the same question in 6 months?? I bet it would be the 
exact same answer &#8220;Within 6 months&#8221;. It will always be extended, because there&#8217;s 
no set date. Whereas if you can have them commit to a particular period of a 
certain month e.g. End of May, that doesn&#8217;t change and the closer you get to 
that date the more urgent it becomes to fix the problem. </p>
<h3>5. &#8220;From your perspective, what do you think frustrates your staff the most 
with their work?&#8221; </h3>
<p>When you ask a question about how others are possibly feeling or doing. It 
will often bring a new light to the table that they haven&#8217;t seen before. We get 
so consumed with our own problems and responsibilities that we often forget 
about the other people around us that have just as much of an effect on the 
company&#8217;s success as we do. </p>
<p>This is especially the case when you ask this to a C-level executive, because 
they know the importance their staff has on the performance of the business. It 
also reminds them of the responsibility they have to lead their staff and make 
sure they are happy with their job and who they work for. </p>
<h3>4. &#8220;How are you currently measuring the success of (what ever your 
product/service can fix &#8211; e.g. technology, productivity, sales, HR&#8230;)?&#8221; 
</h3>
<p>Measurement is very similar to planning. Everybody likes it, everybody knows 
the importance of it, yet few actually do it. Another great question to ask a 
C-Level executive, because every CEO wants to see the ROI of any process, people 
or technology they have invested in. </p>
<p>It will also bring to their attention (without directly pointing it out) that 
they could have a better solution that will improve their ROI on that particular 
part of their business. </p>
<h3>3. &#8220;What will be the process in having this (your solution) approved?&#8221; 
</h3>
<p>There is nothing more frustrating than spending all your time putting 
together a proposal &amp; presentation and then coming back and presenting it all to 
hear the words &#8220;Great, we&#8217;ll now discuss this and be back in touch.&#8221; 
Aaaarrggghhh!!! You must know how they will approve the deal before you present 
anything! This could be one of the biggest mistakes sales professionals make. It 
can make a huge difference to the outcome of the deal going ahead. </p>
<p>This question will also determine whether the person you speaking to is the 
decision maker. If they say they will have to go to another other person to have 
it approved, you either want to see whether they can be present when you present 
your solution or at least find out as much information as possible about them. 
E.g. How they make decisions and what they would want to see in a proposal. </p>
<h3>2. &#8220;What are the essential points that need to be evident in our 
recommendation?&#8221; </h3>
<p>A black and white question that will give you the framework to build your 
recommended solution around. There&#8217;s no use coming back and presenting a 
solution that is based on employee engagement and productivity levels, when they 
specifically want to see predicted ROI from a monetary perspective. </p>
<p>Rule of thumb: There should be 3 KEY points you want to make evidently clear 
in your recommendation/presentation. Any less and they will feel like you 
haven&#8217;t attained a good enough understanding of their challenges and any more 
than 3 they will start to get confused, feeling like you haven&#8217;t clearly 
understood their key challenges. </p>
<h3>1. &#8220;Why?&#8221; </h3>
<p>A why question makes people think. It makes them go deeper into their answer 
where they generally wouldn&#8217;t go. Most people will take the &#8216;top layer&#8217; response 
as a good-enough answer. However, those that go that extra layer down, will 
surely be rewarded for their efforts. Add a &#8220;Why?&#8221; to most of the above 
questions and see what happens. E.g. &#8220;What are your key objectives for the next 
12months?&#8221; ANSWER: &#8220;Increase net revenue by 20%, Improve productivity levels of 
staff and develop a consistent framework to our approach and image.&#8221; </p>
<p>All good information that I&#8217;m sure some of your services/products can assist 
with, right? But let&#8217;s not start rubbing our hands together yet. Let&#8217;s add an 
extended &#8220;Why?&#8221; question to that answer. </p>
<p>&#8220;WHY are these the key objectives?&#8221; </p>
<p>ANSWER: &#8220;Because we need to reach this growth percentage to keep our 
shareholders happy, we also feel that our staff lack structure and process 
around their responsibilities and we want our clients to receive a consistent 
message at all points of contact with-in our company.&#8221; </p>
<p>Ahhh that&#8217;s more like it. Look at some of the words used in that answer: 
need, feel, lack, want. All emotional words that have been said by them (not 
you) and have now made these objectives more real, urgent and important. </p>
