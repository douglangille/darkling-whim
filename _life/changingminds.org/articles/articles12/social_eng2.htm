Social Engineering &#8211; We Start Playing</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Adrian Stolarski</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my previous article we focused on providing an introduction to social 
engineering. For the purposes of this article, I want readers to consider the 
words of Albert Einstein to be their mantra: &#8220;Only two things are infinite &#8211; the 
universe and human stupidity, and I&#8217;m not sure about the former.&#8221; </p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s Go </h2>
<p>So let&#8217;s begin the game. Due to the size and nature of this publication, I am 
forced to narrow the scope of this article to only include the most prominent 
methods of attacks: </p>
<p>Keeping the rules described in the previous article, the first step to a 
successful attack will often involve tricking an employee into performing some 
routine task. This is generally accomplished through an attachment to an e-mail 
containing some interesting information for the targeted employee (i.e. personal 
information from a co-worker, or information on how to access a benefits program 
run by the company). </p>
<p>Shortly after opening the attached document, malware automatically installs 
itself on the victim&#8217;s machine. A typical example of this malware includes a 
program that can record keystrokes, which gives an attacker access to the 
corporate network and data collected on local and network drives. </p>
<p>Another rule that an engineer can utilize when attacking is the rule of 
authority. An attacker can claim to be superior and force a subordinate to 
disclose critical business information. Board members and their closest 
associates are not always subject to the same security standards as regular 
employees. </p>
<p>For example, I once walked into a business with a colleague and we were both 
dressed in formal business wear. Without too much resistance, we were allowed to 
enter the business because everyone assumed we had a strong connection with the 
management division and security preferred not to ask unnecessary questions. 
Attackers can easily use deception tactics to exploit such subservience to 
superiors. </p>
<p>Another extremely dangerous rule used by attackers is the rule of sympathy. 
This works best when imitating an emergency scenario involving immediate family 
or a loved one. For example, a social engineer can call a general company line 
or a private number and explain that a family member will not receive funds 
because of transfer delays and other problems. The attacker will then offer to 
assist the individual in need, but certain information must be provided first, 
such as a bank account number or social security number. </p>
<p>In this situation, victims tend to be guided by a desire to settle the matter 
as soon as possible and often provide information without verifying the 
credentials of the hacker. Another vulnerability occurs when an employee himself 
needs money and is waiting for a bank transfer. Remember that the nervous 
employee is easy to manipulate because emotions prevail. </p>
<p>Keep in mind that most people are not really bad, and generally are guided by 
an instinctive desire to help. This tendency to want to help can also lead to 
another problem: feedback social engineering. A hacker using social engineering 
may stage a scenario (such as depriving employees of access to the network), and 
then go on to pretend to be someone else from the IT department. </p>
<p>Overall, the mechanism for asking for help is one of the most widely used 
manipulations by social engineers. This desire to aid (or seek aid from) a 
co-worker also triggers the reciprocity rule, which makes socially engineered 
attacks even more effective. </p>
<p>In extreme cases, a social engineer does not really have to do anything 
because untrained employees will simply make mistakes with regard to information 
distribution. A simple example is a protocol terminating banking or 
telecommunications accounts. Such information should never flow from the 
company, yet just imagine how many documents are distributed with such 
information throughout the company on a regular basis. </p>
<p>In an even more extreme example, I was talking with the former employee of a 
large telecommunications company in Poland, and our conversation turned to the 
security features of his former company. During this conversation I, drew from 
him all the information I would need to re- route all network traffic from the 
corporate operator. If I had used this information to attack, it would have been 
child&#8217;s play to hack into the company&#8217;s systems. </p>
<p>Another trick: Getting the private phone number of a company employee? To do 
this, one only needs to know an employee&#8217;s name. Once we have a name, we can 
call corporate headquarters and come up with some plausible scenario like: &#8220;Call 
the number xxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx, please. It&#8217;s very urgent! Thanks! This is the 
administrator&#8221; (and other similar variations). If you want a cell number, you 
can pretend to be a customer interested in offering a fictitious contract. A 
faux-secretary will then ask the manager to return your call. </p>
<p>Another important weapon used by a social engineer is garbage. Discarded 
papers contain e-mail addresses, names of managers, and information on 
co-workers. In fact, garbage is very rarely damaged or destroyed, and shredders 
are not designed to completely obliterate text. Vital information could still be 
visible on shredded paper, like account information or a bank balance. With this 
information, a social engineering can successfully reproduce the company&#8217;s 
organizational structure. Or a competitor can bribe a custodian to glean private 
information directly from refuse. </p>
<p>Another very important issue that arises is that every new employee in the 
company will make mistakes. The American model of business often assumes that 
individuals will learn from their previous business experiences at other 
companies. Yet while new employees should be given a larger margin for error, 
they should also be watched vigilantly. </p>
<p>For example, a social engineer may call a company and hold a long, yet 
fruitless conversation. The point of this conversation will be to hear all 
conversations going on in the background. From this overheard noise, a hacker 
will glean addresses, customer IDs, and other private information. Another funny 
thing: we all love corporate network administrators because, thanks to them, we 
can easily get the password to our network. The more complicated the password, 
the better for us; and the more passwords, the better. </p>
<p>However, the human brain has some limitations, and not all employees can 
remember the number of combinations in long passwords. So employees save their 
passwords on pieces of paper or use a simple password dictionary. Remember, if 
we have to save a password on a piece of paper, then let&#8217;s be careful about it 
and hide the password well. In front there should be 5 random characters, and 
then the password should be made of 10-20 random characters. Or, create ten 
lines of text consisting of random characters, and insert the password in only 
one of the lines of text. </p>
<p>The social engineer may also physically visit the employee of a larger 
organization while pretending to work with a potential client, allied company, 
or even the police. Using this strategy, call and say that an attacker may say 
that he or she has prepare a questionnaire in order to improve cooperation 
between two companies. In this way, using a mechanism of information that is 
relevant, a social engineer can gain information that can be useful for an 
attack later on </p>
<p>Another situation that rarely arises is a direct attack on the company 
&#8212;though these are almost impossible to achieve. A hacker that has gathered 
sufficient information can pretend to either courier or deliver a physical 
package for a specific employee. If the cover story is built correctly, the 
&#8220;delivery&#8221; person will claim to be dropping off a package, and through this 
ruse, gain physical access to a business. Once said &#8220;delivery&#8221; person is in the 
building, he or she can behave like an ordinary employee. No one will check. In 
such situations a hacker can easily get access to printed information or other 
data. </p>
<p>Remember the previously mentioned rule about items that are not available? 
Well, once an item becomes more available, it also becomes more of a target in 
the eyes of the hacker. A social engineer may create a situation that forces a 
staff member to impart critical information. For example, a hacker may deny a 
user access to a company server, and through this ploy, gain access to account 
passwords and information. </p>
<p>A similar tactic can be to create the impression that a credit card is 
deactivated or in danger of not being processed correctly. A hacker will ask a 
victim to please enter login and password information for a personal account, 
such as eBay. Phishing devices are common with this type of hack. Again, with a 
phishing scenario the mechanism is very simple and consists of persuading the 
victim to disclose the specific information needed for fraud. With this type of 
scam, an attacker doesn&#8217;t need to be an IT expert: he or she simply needs a bit 
of ingenuity combined with social engineering and a naïve target. </p>
<h2>How to Defend </h2>
<p>Above are just a few examples of the hundreds and thousands of techniques 
that can be used in socially engineered attacks. Every day attackers learn to 
use every aspect of daily life. They expand their knowledge by taking courses in 
psychology, sociology, and anthropology, and continue to develop their natural 
gifts. Our main strengths in combating these attacks lie in confidence, 
patience, and experience. Keeping this in mind, we can develop techniques that 
are 100% effective against socially engineered attacks. </p>
<p>First, check and re-check whether the person you&#8217;re talking with is who he or 
she claims to be. By weaving webs of manipulation, social engineers can learn a 
lot I about a company and a victim, but they can&#8217;t learn everything. This is why 
it&#8217;s so important to follow all safety and security rules at all times. If we 
have six verification codes and randomly select K, then let the caller verify 
use of code K. Let&#8217;s not yield to his request to bypass a code or procedure 
because he has provided some excuse like saving time or that there is another 
person working at his computer. This may be a clever lie, and the caller may 
simply be a social engineer who knows one code and is trying to learn another.
</p>
<p>I ask you reader, do not indulge in emotions, peer pressure, or fears of 
authority. Remember The Matrix? &#8220;You have to give up everything. Fear. Lack of 
faith. Doubt.&#8221; If my boss is wrong, I look him in the eye and tell him that he 
is wrong. If I see a company that has hired me is not ready for a simultaneous 
attack, I give it to that company straight. I&#8217;m not afraid of losing a job or 
facing consequences. </p>
<p>Never open email attachments or files from unknown sources. For more 
information, check out the resources at InfoSec. </p>
<p>Ensure regular and thorough destruction of garbage and other printed 
materials produced by the business. Don&#8217;t disclose any confidential material or 
write said material in documents meant for general circulation. Block calls from 
independent third parties so they cannot hear the background noise going on in 
your office. If you meet resistance from company management, review this 
article. </p>
<p>Be sure to check the credentials of any person asking or offering to help, 
especially with regard to financial situations. </p>
<p>Also, regularly train staff members to be aware of social engineering and 
tactics employed by hackers. A well-trained staff can halve the problem. </p>
<h2>In Conclusion </h2>
<p>Social engineering is really the manipulation of human behavior in order to 
achieve material gain or confidential data. This is not a new phenomenon. Since 
the dawn of humanity, individuals have been using the principles of social 
engineering to achieve their goals; and as technology has advanced, tactics for 
socially engineered attacks have become more and more common among hackers. I 
hope that after reading this article you&#8217;ll have a better understanding of this 
problem as it threatens company security. <br>
