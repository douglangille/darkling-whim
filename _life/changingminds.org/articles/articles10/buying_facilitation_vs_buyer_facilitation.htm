<h1>Buying Facilitation<sup>?</sup> vs. buyer facilitation</h1>

Buying Facilitation<sup>?</sup> vs. buyer facilitation</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lately, I&#8217;ve noticed folks using the term buyer facilitation. While I can 
make a good guess that the term is a version of Buying Facilitation<sup>?</sup>, 
it is being used in a &#8217;sales&#8217; context. So maybe, the term is to be used in 
conjunction with Buying Facilitation<sup>?</sup>. After all, the buyer must 
manage both the internal decision issues and the need-related decision issues 
before a purchase happens. </p>
<h3>Here is a complete definition of Buying Facilitation<sup>?</sup>:</h3>
<p>Buying Facilitation<sup>?</sup> is a decision facilitation skill that acts as 
an unbiased GPS tool to assist buyers in navigating through their unique, 
behind-the-scenes change issues to ensure they get the buy-in necessary to bring 
in a new solution. </p>
<p>I named my model Buying Facilitation<sup>?</sup> because it&#8217;s precisely what we need to 
be doing in addition to selling: helping buyers facilitate the internal, 
off-line, behind-the-scenes, personal decision process that we are not privy to. 
It manages that important meeting between colleagues over lunch, the fight that 
needs to be resolved between department heads before budgets can be used, the 
political issues that will get the right folks to meetings, that the right 
considerations and implementation concerns are on the agenda. We are indeed 
helping facilitate the buying decision, but it&#8217;s core is change management. It&#8217;s 
the stuff that often has nothing to do with need or solution. And the stuff that 
sales methods don&#8217;t address, yet needs to happen before buyers can go ahead with 
any purchase. </p>
<p>Buyers must manage their off-line, politically-driven change issues before 
they can consider making a purchase even if they have a need that is an absolute 
fit with a seller&#8217;s solution. (How many times have you seen the perfect client 
fail to buy? This is why.) Sales manages the tail end of the buying decision &#8211; 
the solution end. Buying Facilitation? manages the off-line, internal decision 
end&#8230; with a very different skill set and outcome than sales. Sellers sometimes 
have a hard time with this concept because they are still thinking &#8217;sales.&#8217; But 
both models are necessary. We&#8217;ve just never had access to skills that help 
buyers navigate through the private stuff that goes on without us, while we sit 
and wait. </p>
<p>I asked my colleague David Deans who recently wrote a blog post that used the 
term &#8216;buyer facilitation&#8217; if he&#8217;d give me his definition: &#8220;The context in which 
I use the words buyer, seller, guidance, enablement or facilitation together is 
totally generic in nature &#8212; relative to the traditional commercial 
buying-cycle.&#8221; David is speaking about guiding and enabling the buyer at the 
solution end of the decision. In that context, buyer facilitation helps the 
sellers manage the placement of the solution, and how the solution will be 
accepted and chosen to fill the need: in relation to other vendors, price, 
solutions, and solution/need fit. In other words, it&#8217;s a more specific word for 
sales. </p>
<h3>How Buying Facilitation<sup>?</sup> Was Conceived</h3>
<p>For those of you having difficulty understanding the difference between 
Buying Facilitation<sup>?</sup> and sales or buy<u>er</u> facilitation, or trying to use sales 
thinking instead of change management thinking, let me tell you specifically, 
and in far greater detail than you ever wanted to know, what I&#8217;m doing here. And 
for those of you who find yourself falling asleep, please feel free to stop 
reading. This is a level of detail I rarely, if ever, share. When I teach 
sellers how to do Buying Facilitation<sup>?</sup>, I make it much easier :) </p>
<p>Buying Facilitation<sup>?</sup> is a GPS navigation tool that gives buyers navigation 
capability to both recognize and manage the unconscious decision issues they 
need to address before making a decision for a purchase or change. Ultimately 
(net/net) we are teaching all of the possibly unrecognized folks who might touch 
the &#8216;need&#8217; or solution how to buy-in, to choose our solution where and if 
possible &#8211; a sort of &#8216;influencing with integrity.&#8217; Using it, we speed up the 
sales cycle exponentially, discover prospects we wouldn&#8217;t have discovered, have 
prospects buy who didn&#8217;t realize they had a need. We are not focusing on &#8216;need&#8217; 
or &#8217;solution&#8217; or &#8216;relationship,&#8217; but on the internal stuff that only insiders 
know about. The personal stuff that makes our buyers disappear for so long. The 
political stuff that makes good prospects never come back. </p>
<p>Here are details of Buying Facilitation<sup>?</sup> skills: </p>
<ol>
	<li><u>Managing Internal Decision Making</u>: I&#8217;ve coded the 3 phases all 
	decisions go through as they go from unconscious to conscious, strategic to 
	tactical. Everyone uses these decision phases, regardless of the type of 
	decision, whether it&#8217;s conscious or not, and whether it&#8217;s a personal or 
	group decisions. These phases are written about in detail in my book Dirty 
	Little Secrets. </li>
	<li><u>Managing How Appropriate Factors Get Considered</u>: Different from 
	conventional questions that pull data, Facilitative Questions pull 
	unconscious criteria from where it&#8217;s &#8217;stored&#8217; in the brain (indexes, or 
	indices), using the proper words to ensure that the appropriate 
	considerations are taken into account. To formulate Facilitative Questions 
	demands the questioner listen for systems, not content, and be unbiased &#8211; 
	biased only by the knowledge of systems and decision phases. Why is this 
	necessary? Because people must pull together all of their conscious and 
	unconscious criteria before making a decision; the time it takes them to do 
	this is the length of the sales cycle. They need to do this anyway (We never 
	make decisions that go against our values.). In sales, Facilitative 
	Questions illuminate internal, private decision issues (people, policies, 
	problems, vendor issues, money issues, alternate solution choices, rules, 
	history, etc) that need to buy-in to any change (a solution or vendor choice 
	for example). </li>
	<li><u>Managing How People Recognize All Options</u>: Presumptive Summaries 
	help with the thinking process. They bring together the underlying messages 
	that are a critical part of their thinking. These do not just summarize the 
	content. They actually make conscious some unconscious choices. </li>
	<li><u>Managing How Sellers Become GPS Systems And Change Agents</u>: No one 
	has ever taught us how to listen for systems. But this skill enables the 
	seller (or coach or influencer) to formulate the Facilitative Questions and 
	Presumptive Summaries without bias. </li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, the skills of Buying Facilitation<sup>?</sup> are all based on being a 
neutral navigator to help Others manage the political, personal, and sometimes 
crazy private decisions they must address before being willing to change&#8230; 
regardless of their need! They have always done this off-line, 
behind-the-scenes; sellers have never been privy to this. </p>
<p>Hopefully, you can now recognize the two different skill sets, with two 
different results: Buying Facilitation<sup>?</sup> manages the unconscious, internal 
decision issues to efficiently get buy-in for change and solution choice; and 
sales manages the need, the solution, and the solution placement. </p>
<p>I hope I didn&#8217;t bore you. But I hope that you now understand the difference 
between Buying Facilitation<sup>?</sup> and buyer facilitation, between being a GPS system 
to navigate private systems choices without bias, and sales which understands 
need and places solutions. I&#8217;m happy to start a discussion here, or contact me
