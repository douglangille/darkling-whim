Thinking of Saving Future-Make investments that are reliable</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Christina Jones</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
At present many people are wondering about the 
best investment options available 
but today&#8217;s investors have a number of investment options as compared to the 
investors a few decades ago. As high returns can not be guaranteed in financial 
markets but you can adopt several strategies through which you can easily better 
your chances at earning high returns. Before going for any option the 
risk-return ratio should be kept in mind. It has been generally observed that 
the options which present the extremely high returns possibility also have a 
possibility of extremely low returns. Having so many investment options is a 
good feature because these options overload the system and lead many people to 
think several times before taking a decision and most probably prevent them from 
taking a decision. 
Money investment is a broad ranged topic and it may confuse 
some people but this is an understandable thing. There are multiple investment 
vehicles and many some of the best investment options. Some of the people may 
choose active investment in the market or they can earn residual income by 
passive investment. <p>
This article is about the best investment options but the degree of money 
investment to be the best one depends upon the objectives of investment and the 
degree of risk involved. As risk and returns are directly proportional to one 
another so best investment options for risk tolerant individuals is going to 
vary. Furthermore it has been observed that even if some people have the same 
level of risk tolerance then adopting a different option as compared to the 
other ones can help them achieve their goals. <p>
The first thing in this respect you want to do is to define your goals. This 
makes you choose a better investment vehicle for yourself. Your goal may be the 
major purchases like a down payment for a home, a car, college fee or an 
expensive vacation or some long term goals like keeping pace with the changing 
times or retirement. After you have determined your goal you need to find an 
investment vehicle. After that you should open an investment account. And then 
there are many options for you to choose from that which option you are going to 
be taking. <p>
Here are listed some of the best investment options which can make your search 
an easier on:<p>
You can make your investment in fixed deposits. These deposits are meant for 
those investors who are intending to invest for a fixed period of time say from 
15 days to some 5 or 6 years. In this way they earn a high interest. This option 
is one of the commonest investment options for an average investor to invest in. 
it has an advantage of gaining high interest on the deposited amount but the 
facility varies from bank to bank. <p>
Just like investment in fixed deposits you can also deposit your gold coins, 
jewelry and ornaments in a gold deposit and you can earn interest on it. Some of 
the banks offer this service. When you make your investment your gold is 
converted into gold bars and you get a certificate in effect. There can be a 
specified minimum amount of gold that you must deposit. After maturity you can 
either get your repayment in gold or the equivalent amount of cash. In this way 
in contrast of leaving your gold you can earn some profit from it.<p>
Another option can be to make investment in the stock markets. It can be risky, 
confusing and many times it proves profitable too. For that the investors should 
take a good knowledge of the fast paced stock markets. The research for the 
strategies of trading and buying shares is going to help the new coming 
investors to avoid losses and they can thus make fine investments in the future.
<p>
Investment in national saving certificates is also a good option. These are the 
certificates that are issued by the government. These certificates have been 
specially designed for the government servants, businessmen and some other 
salaried individuals. It is a long term investment option and is safe as well. 
These certificates have approximately maturity period of 6 years. <p>
Investors can also make money investment in the Public provident fund. It is a 
flexible option to choose. Unlike a bank recurring scheme same amount of money 
need not to be deposited per year. Rs. 60,000 per year is the maximum amount of 
money that is required to be deposited. The amount can go up to 70,000 for some 
investors and the minimum amount of money is Rs. 500 per year. The amount of 
interest is fixed by the government, at present it is 8 % per year. <p>
Investing in mutual funds is also a fine option to invest in. Investing in 
mutual funds means somehow a collective investment scheme in which a group of 
investors pool their money and hire a portfolio manager. The manager then 
invests this money in buying shares in the stock markets, bonds or securities. 
The manager continues buying and selling the shares according to the prospectus 
of the fund. One thing that&#8217;s obvious 
about mutual funds is that the market 
risks are the same as in the stock markets along with the fair share of profits. 
Some of the good reasons about mutual funds which should make you go for them 
are that 
investing in mutual funds is a diversified option as it leads access to 
a number of individual stocks and bonds. These funds are professionally managed 
so those investors who can&#8217;t manage their time or resources to buy individual 
stocks need not to worry. Mutual funds come in a variety of types like 
target-date funds, sector funds and money market mutual funds. Mutual funds may 
be considered the best investment options because one better thing about mutual 
funds is that it is a much safer option. If the company of mutual funds goes out 
of business the each of the investors to get the amount of money investment they 
made. <p>
These were some of the best investment options which you can consider. Your 
savings can not do that much good to you as much investment does because 
investment is for your long term goals. So it&#8217;s a weapon to make your future 
safer and secure. <p>
