The Hidden Advantage of Disagreements</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Thejendra BS</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A popular comic strip once showed a soldier diligently watering a lawn in the 
rain. When a puzzled passer-by questions the need for a hose during a rain the 
solder answers he was simply following orders that the lawn must to be watered 
everyday. And then mischievously adds that soldiers are forbidden from 
disagreeing or questioning the orders made by their superiors. Conventional 
wisdom usually shows that going quietly with the established flow is the path to 
success and happiness. For example, if you are the boss and you have team 
members who don't support you in everything, you may argue that it can undermine 
morale, reduce your authority, weaken the team, project or even sabotage the 
company goals. So a good team player is one who does not rock the boat, delay 
decisions or introduce roadblocks. And obviously having people who agree with 
you on anything and everything has many perceived advantages like below. </p>
<ol>
	<li>Working with cooperative people is a joy and necessary to achieve a 
	goal. After all who would like to work with people who disagree? </li>
	<li>Things get done faster when you have people who agree with you on 
	anything and everything. </li>
	<li>With people who collaborate easily there will be less conflicts, stress 
	and irritation. </li>
</ol>
<p>And so on. The above reasons appear valid because people see disagreements in 
the workplace lead to anger, confusion, fear, embarrassment, etc., and so it 
must be avoided at all costs. However, putting the popular reasons aside for 
sometime there are several hidden reasons why surrounding yourself with yes-men, 
apple-polishers and people who blindly agree without questioning for various 
reasons (including fear) can actually be a poison pill for you. While preventing 
disagreements may have its valid reasons in the armed forces, the same formula 
in the civilian and corporate world can often become a disaster as you will soon 
see. To be truly successful you must periodically welcome a generous dose of 
disagreement in every major or important decision you take, even if you are an 
expert in what you do. The suggestion for openly inviting disagreement may seem 
odd because it can be infuriating, insulting, irritating and seen as a roadblock 
to your plans. But beneath the hood there are several advantages of accepting 
people who can question your plans, decisions, demands, ideas, etc., provided 
you learn the ability to see it in an objective way. Many times the advantages 
of seeking advice from people who have the courage to disagree can often far 
outweigh the advantages of surrounding yourself with only who agree. The reasons 
why you need some disagreement are as follows. </p>
<ol>
	<li>Lack of dissent and disagreement means lack of analysis. Everything has 
	a downside when viewed from certain angles. This has been aptly demonstrated 
	by Alfred Sloan (CEO of General Motors from 1923 to 1956) who once said in a 
	directors' meeting, &#8216;Gentlemen, I take it that we are all in complete 
	agreement on the decision here. Then, I propose that we postpone further 
	discussion to give ourselves time to develop disagreement and perhaps gain 
	some understanding of what the decision is all about.&#8217; If Alfred Sloan 
	couldn't find opposition to an important decision, he would postpone it to 
	give his business managers some time to think about the pros and cons in 
	different ways. </li>
	<li>A disagreement can often prevent you from rushing into bad decisions and 
	choices. They give you time and press the brakes to ponder over it though 
	you may get irritated by the delay and roadblocks. It is quite possible you 
	may have done extensive homework on a decision, but still may have 
	overlooked a simple, but important point, which the dissenting person can 
	see when looked from a different angle. </li>
	<li>Use disagreements to you advantage. Cynics, pessimists and people who 
	can disagree are right nine times out of ten. So learn how to extract gold 
	from it. When you are doing a project or a major task you need people who 
	can blurt out problems and roadblocks openly, not someone who will gleefully 
	say everything can be done and pat your back. Every time a cynic opens his 
	mouth you know what exactly needs to be fixed so that a project can succeed. 
	Ask yourself, &#8216;How can I use this information?&#8217; or &#8216;How much time, money and 
	effort is involved to solve all these problems?&#8217; </li>
	<li>You need to accept opposition objectively and professionally. You should 
	encourage people to disagree with you so that all sides of the decision can 
	be carefully examined. Unless you are a megalomaniac or an extremely 
	dismissive person, you must accept the fact that countless people below or 
	above you will be more talented, smarter, knowledgeable and more powerful 
	than you. It is not enough to invite dissent and criticism because it is the 
	new management fad or just for the heck of it, and later victimize or target 
	the person for saying something you didn't like to hear. </li>
	<li>Don't be afraid to disagree or accept disagreement. Real leaders accept 
	disagreement. Surrounding yourself with yes men simply means they are just 
	rubber stamping everything you say without adding any value or digging deep 
	into the issue. A certain amount of honest friction heightens interest and 
	establishes mutual respect. However, when dealing with subordinates you have 
	to invite dissent by asking beautiful questions. People beneath you will 
	never openly dissent if you have blown your fuse or acted irrational 
	earlier. Many employees, especially newcomers, will not speak up in an 
	atmosphere where they feel their ideas are not welcome. </li>
	<li>If you are famous or popular chances are everyone around will always 
	agree with you and applaud all your decisions. If you notice such a thing 
	then you need to be extra careful of those who are too supportive of your 
	ideas and suggestions. This is because they will also not prevent you from 
	making mega mistakes. So whether it is your decision of buying an unsuitable 
	equipment for your organization, or even going to the extent of cooking the 
	books to commit some fraud they will not oppose or openly dissent. Later on, 
	when something goes wrong badly the yes men around will quickly disappear 
	and not share the blame by promptly claiming that it was all your decision. 
	Of course, if they had disagreed earlier but you did not care or bulldozed 
	their opinions then only you are to be solely blamed. </li>
	<li>Another the key to managing disagreements is to prevent it from taking a 
	personal turn as 99% of disagreements turn into conflicts and become dirty. 
	The simple reason for this is the way a disagreement is put forth. Many a 
	time a particular suggestion or idea may invoke a swift and brutal objection 
	due to various reasons, bad past experiences or the way it is proposed. 
	Disagreement has to be strongly focused on the issue or idea, and not on the 
	person or the way the person blurted out the opinion, or body language, bad 
	choice of words, etc. Though etiquette counts, the emotional aspect must be 
	carefully and consciously filtered out so that you can to refocus on the 
	issue or in extreme cases abandon the idea completely. </li>
	<li>One must also understand that disagreement and dissent should not be 
	done just for the sake of it like opposition politicians who have a standard 
	policy to oppose everything that the ruling party does. Arguing just for the 
	sake of arguing is also not productive disagreement. </li>
</ol>
<p>And we can conclude this chapter with two great quotes on agreeing. </p>
<p>&#8216;The fellow that agrees with everything you say is either a fool or he is 
getting ready to skin you.&#65533; Kin Hubbard </p>
<p>&#8216;The people to fear are not those who disagree with you, but those who 
disagree with you and are too cowardly to let you know.&#8217; Napoleon Bonaparte. </p>
