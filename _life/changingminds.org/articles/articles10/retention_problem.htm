<h1>Retention is a Problem That Won't Go Away</h1>

Retention is a Problem That Won't Go Away</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: John Boe</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are the critical factors that contribute to the retention of top 
producing salespeople? Why are some sales managers able to consistently recruit 
and retain quality salespeople, while other managers have a revolving door? 
Excessive personnel turnover is not only unhealthy for the morale of a sales 
force, but it is also costly in terms of time and money. Perhaps less obvious, 
but just as detrimental, is the negative impact excessive turnover has on 
eroding customer confidence and loyalty. </p>
<p>A career in sales can be extremely lucrative for the person who is able to 
prospect effectively and willing to work hard. However, surveys indicate that 
compensation is just one piece in the career satisfaction puzzle. Salespeople 
make their decision to leave or stay with a company for a variety of personal 
and professional reasons. Retaining successful salespeople is not a secret 
recipe, but a formula that includes factors such as leadership, recruitment, 
training, and professional growth opportunities. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Salespeople Don't Quit Companies, They Leave Managers </b> <br>
While the skills required to be an effective salesperson are fundamentally 
important, they are not always a reliable indicator of leadership potential. 
Companies need to select the right people for management positions and offer 
them development opportunities to ensure that they continue to enhance their 
leadership and communications skills. </p>
<p>A sales manager's career and income potential is inescapably intertwined with 
their ability to recruit, develop, and retain a top producing sales force. The 
most effective sales managers acknowledge the reality of personnel turnover and 
prudently plan for replacements. Only naïve or inexperienced managers are 
oblivious to their critical role in the equation of agent retention. Job exit 
surveys consistently indicate that job satisfaction is directly linked to the 
quality of the relationship they have with their sales manager. Award winning 
managers intuitively understand this important fact and as a result, treat their 
salespeople more as business partners than employees. </p>
<p>Progressive leaders choose to inspire and empower rather than direct and 
control their sales force. Recognizing that a strong relationship is indeed the 
key to their success, they lead by example, praise achievement, and strive to 
maintain open communications. Those managers who adopt and practice the 
principals of enlightened leadership find that their people understand what is 
expected of them and deliver. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Both Success and Failure Leave a Trail </b> <br>
The retention of quality salespeople is not accidental and begins up front in 
the recruiting and selection process. Due to the high rejection and demanding 
nature of a sales career, it is fundamentally important to administer a 
temperament suitability evaluation early on. While there is no testing 
instrument that can guarantee you will hire the right person every time, a 
temperament evaluation will provide valuable insight into a candidate's career 
suitability and potential success as a salesperson. Sales managers who utilize 
temperament evaluations find that they are better prepared to interview in a 
more in-depth manner. </p>
<p>During the selection process, it is imperative to check references and look 
for a history of job stability. In my opinion, there are two mandatory qualities 
any new hire should possess. The first quality I look for is loyalty. If a 
person is not loyal to their company, they are more likely to violate company 
policies and procedures. Disloyal employees are also the first to leave when the 
going gets tough. The second quality I look for is dependability. It makes 
absolutely no sense to invest huge amounts of emotional and financial capital 
training someone you can't depend on. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Training<br>
</b>There is absolutely no substitute for a well-trained and highly motivated sales 
force! Training is critically important for both the new and seasoned agent 
alike and is a key ingredient for agent retention. Experienced sales managers 
place a high premium on training and purposefully design their programs to be 
timely, relevant, realistic, and reoccurring. </p>
<p>In his best selling book, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, Dr. 
Stephen Covey makes a strong case for the fundamental importance of training, or 
as he calls it, &quot;sharpening the saw.&quot; Salespeople are often reluctant to take 
time away from their busy schedule for training and as a result, over time, 
become less productive. While established salespeople might not always ask for 
assistance, they frequently need help game planning appointments and appreciate 
their sales manager's involvement. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Growth Opportunities<br>
</b>In an effort to retain solid performers, progressive companies offer a clear 
career path and proactively support the leadership development of their top 
salespeople. People want to grow personally and professionally and wise managers 
encourage and accommodate this need by providing a wide range of opportunities. 
Access to ongoing training and personal development is important and often 
provides a strong incentive to stay with a company. </p>
<p>Recognition and Rewards<br>
Traditionally, sales managers have relied primarily on commission to motivate 
their sales force. A compensation structure based solely on commission does not 
address separate motivational factors and therefore, commission alone will not 
adequately motivate nor retain a sales force. To be effective, a sales incentive 
program should not only appeal to top producers, but it must also excite average 
to below average salespeople as well. Once a salesperson stretches to a new 
level of personal production, their self-confidence and expectations skyrocket!
</p>
<p>The key to staying one step ahead in these competitive times is recognizing 
that people are by far a company's most important asset!</p>
