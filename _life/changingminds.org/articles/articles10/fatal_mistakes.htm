32 Fatal Negotiating Mistakes That Cost Salespeople Money</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Kelley Robertson</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>Most sales people are required to negotiate with their prospects and 
customers. But let's face it, today's consumer and corporate buyer is much more 
aggressive when negotiating the terms of a sale. Unfortunately, many sales 
people lack the same level of sophistication when negotiating with savvy 
purchasers. Here are thirty-two fatal mistakes that sales people often make when 
they negotiate. </p>
<p>1. Believing that price is the primary reason why people make a buying 
decision. Although price is a factor in every sale, it is seldom the motivating 
factor behind a person's final decision </p>
<p>2. Not asking enough high-value questions. I'm still amazed how few sales 
people take the time to ask great questions during the sales process which makes 
it more difficult for them to effectively position their offering. </p>
<p>3. Not gathering the RIGHT information. While it is essential to ask 
questions, it is equally important to ask the right questions so you can 
negotiate more effectively. </p>
<p>4. Falling prey to the myth that ALL of your competitors are always cheaper. 
Someone, somewhere will always be able to sell a similar product for less. 
However, unless you are the absolute highest priced vendor in your marketplace, 
not all of your competitors will be cheaper. </p>
<p>5. Failing to establish the value of their product, service or solution. 
Value is in the eyes of the beholder so determine what is important to each 
buyer or customer and position your product or service accordingly. </p>
<p>6. Allowing their ego to get in the way. Negotiating is part of business but 
I have seen people walk away from a good deal because their ego got in the way 
and clouded their judgment. </p>
<p>7. Failing to remain objective during the sales and negotiating process. </p>
<p>8. Another mistake is to reveal any deadlines you working with. A tight 
deadline puts you under time pressure and a savvy person will use this grind out 
a better deal for themselves. </p>
<p>9. Neglecting to negotiate with limited authority. Don't hesitate to tell a 
prospect that you need to check with your boss before you agree to a concession. 
This gives you wiggle room and allows you to appear that you are working on 
behalf of your customer. </p>
<p>10. Failing to plan. Failure to plan means planning to fail. Invest the time 
to plan your approach, the tactics you will use, the concessions you are 
prepared to make, and what information you still need to negotiate the best 
possible outcome. </p>
<p>11. Failing to determine a walk-away point. If you don't know when to walk 
away from a sale, you could end up losing money. </p>
<p>12. Unable to walk away. Too many sales people find themselves in the 
position of accepting an offer only to discover later that the deal actually 
cost them money. If the sale doesn't make good business sense be prepared to 
walk away from it, regardless of the time you have invested. </p>
<p>13. Not taking a time out to think. Important decisions are sometimes made 
without proper thought; often in the heat of the moment or in order to get the 
deal done. Taking the time to think about the implications can save you money 
and add critical profit dollars to your bottom line. </p>
<p>14. Failing to get a different perspective. I often talk to my business 
partner before making a final negotiating decision. This gives me a different 
perspective, and often, new ideas and strategies. Use your time out to review 
the deal with someone who is not attached to the outcome. </p>
<p>15. Negotiating with the wrong person or people. If you're not talking to 
someone who can make a final buying decision then you are dealing with the wrong 
person. </p>
<p>16. Talking too much. I have watched dozens of sales people negotiate with 
themselves because they talked too much. The best negotiators listen more than 
they talk. </p>
<p>17. Not using silence as a negotiating strategy. I saw this in action when my 
wife spoke to a client on the telephone. Instead of immediately responding to 
the person's request, she paused and remained silent. A few moments later, the 
client made a concession that added more money to the deal. </p>
<p>18. Making too many assumptions. You may have heard the expression, &quot;Assuming 
makes an ASS of U and ME.&quot; Enough said. </p>
<p>19. Not properly using written testimonials and endorsements. Assuming you 
have testimonials in place, I suggest arranging them into different categories 
so you can use the right testimonial at the right time. </p>
<p>20. Giving in too soon. People appreciate what they have to work for. If you 
give in too soon, people will think that something is wrong with the product or 
that you are desperate for the sale. </p>
<p>21. Not listening carefully enough. Instead of waiting for your turn to speak 
listen intently to other person. It sounds simple but it takes effort, energy 
and patience. </p>
<p>22. Fear of losing the sale. Remember, there will always be someone else to 
sell to. This fear is more prominent when a sales person's pipeline is running 
on empty so avoid it by constantly adding new prospects to your pipeline. </p>
<p>23. Immediately offering a discount to close the deal. Remember, price is 
seldom the primary reason people make buying decision. Avoid the temptation to 
drop your price unless you have first considered other options. </p>
<p>24. Making too many concessions without getting something in return. If the 
other person refuses to make concession, you are simply negotiating against 
yourself. Don't be afraid to ask for something in return for offering a 
concession. </p>
<p>25. Failing to pay close attention for clues and underlying messages. Watch 
the other person's behaviour and body language. If they look down when asking 
for a discount, it indicates that they may be uncomfortable making that request.
</p>
<p>26. Making concessions too quickly. When you make people wait before you 
concede to something, you increase the value of that concession and you 
subconsciously tell them that if they keep asking for concessions, the 
negotiating process will take longer. </p>
<p>27. Lack of confidence. This is usually a result of lack of negotiating 
skills which is why it is important to practise negotiating as often as 
possible. It can also be caused when negotiating with someone who is perceived 
to have more power than you. </p>
<p>28. Being overconfident when entering the negotiations. Get your ego out of 
the picture. I have seen some sales go sideways because the seller was 
overconfident in their approach. </p>
<p>29. Failing to practise. Great negotiators use every available opportunity to 
practise their skills. The more you negotiate the better you will get and the 
more comfortable you will become. </p>
<p>30. Believing that the buyer or customer has all the power. While I accept 
the fact that buyers have more leverage in today's business climate, it is 
essential to realize that you can walk away from a deal if the other person get 
too aggressive or makes unrealistic demands. </p>
<p>31. Not using a variety of tactics and strategies. Great negotiators are well 
versed and they know how and when to use specific tactics such as the Flinch, 
Trade-off Principle, Nibble, etc. </p>
<p>32. Trying to rush the negotiating process. Effective negotiators have the 
patience of Job. They can wait out delays and they never show anxiety when the 
process doesn't move as quickly as they would like it to. </p>
<p>There you have it. Thirty-two mistakes, blunders and gaffes that sales people 
make when negotiating. Avoid these errors and improve your results, your 
top-line sales and your bottom-line profits.</p>
