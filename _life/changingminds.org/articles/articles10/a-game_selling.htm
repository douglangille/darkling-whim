A-Game Selling in a Forever Changing Market</p>

<h3>
Abstract</h3>
<p>
Agile sales organizations have opportunities to accelerate top-line revenue 
growth via a renewed commitment to re-engaging, re-tooling, and re-engineering 
their sales teams. &#8220;Back to basics&#8221; strategies are akin to rearranging the deck 
chairs on the Titanic-a losing proposition to effectively leapfrog the 
competition. New skill sets are requisite for sellers to create meaningful 
business impact within customer organizations that now leverage cross-functional 
buying committees who demand a demonstrable return on investment. Achieving an 
A-game still requires a laser-focus on driving meaningful behavioral shifts 
throughout the ranks; however, the skills required to be a front-runner today, 
versus 5 years ago are as changed as the market we now fi nd ourselves 
navigating.</p>
<h3>
Article</h3>
<p>
All hopes are that the doom and gloom of the past few years is behind us and 
that a rebound is eminent. As executives seek new means to drive top line 
revenue, new challenges have emerged. Many sales organizations now resemble 
tattered battleships. Their innards are exposed by gaping holes created by the 
anemic economy, and fewer hands are on deck for a<br>
newly charted course. Much of the crew has been lost as many were pushed 
overboard in an effort to make it into an EBIDTA safe harbor. When speaking to 
key leaders looking at a forever changed environment, one term comes to mind: 
shell shocked.</p>
<p class="quote">
shell&#8217;·shocked&#8217;, adjective: (per Merriam-Webster&#8217;s Dictionary)<br>
1: affected with combat fatigue<br>
2: mentally confused, upset, or exhausted as a result of excessive stress</p>
<p>
As total volume has dropped, fewer opportunities abound for the taking. 
Voracious competition for a<br>
smaller pie has created margin pressures unlike any time most have ever 
experienced. That smaller pie has<br>
made every opportunity critical, no matter the size or scope: &#8220;We need to make 
this deal happen. Do what<br>
it takes to get it done.&#8221; Sound familiar? This commonplace approach has created 
shifts in seller behavior.</p>
<p>
Some classic consultative sellers have been lured into the dark, transactional 
side of selling only to make a<br>
sale. The great strides made in raising the bar of sales organizations&#8217; skill 
sets during the boom years are in<br>
danger of being squandered inadvertently as a result.</p>
<p>
As leaders search for a new strategy, those sales organizations agile enough to 
react quickly to this changed market are poised to seize a greater share of 
opportunities. Although many rules of engagement have changed, one rule remains 
the same: Creating an A-game requires investment in people, processes, and 
systems.</p>
<h2>
Ship-Shaped Sales Teams</h2>
<p>
Even though the &#8220;seascape&#8221; of selling is forever changed, sellers still have to 
manage a sales process to closure. While this new selling &#8220;seascape&#8221; is markedly 
different, most sales teams have changed very little in response. When 
questioning executives whether their sales team has changed in the past 3 years, 
more than often than not, the answer is &#8220;no&#8221;. Resoundingly, we hear that the 
skill sets of most sales teams remain relatively unchanged compared to the 
metamorphosis of the market and customers.</p>
<p>
There is good news in this. Because so few sales teams were able to focus on 
capability development during the recession, the downturned economy created a 
unique leveling of the playing fi eld. If before the recession you lagged behind 
more than you liked in developing your people, it&#8217;s likely you aren&#8217;t behind any 
longer. Taking quick action now can turn an old &#8220;B&#8221;-game into an A-game. However 
a cautionary notewhat worked well in the past may not work well current day in 
terms of your team&#8217;s skill sets.</p>
<p>
The SEC (Sales Executive Council) conducted a survey in 2009 of 450 sales 
manager and looked at attitudes, skills, behaviors, activities, and knowledge of 
over 1000 sales professionals within 30 organizations globally. They too found 
that a &#8220;back to basics strategy&#8221; as it relates to re-tooling your team &#8220;is a 
losing strategy&#8221;. As an outcome of their fi ndings, a seller profi le emerged 
which had the highest number of top performers. The result; the top performers 
embodied more unconventional characteristics than any of the other four profi 
les identifi ed. The SEC&#8217;s study reiterates the need for creating a deeper 
understanding of what it will require to create an A-game today.</p>
<p>
Today&#8217;s market looks very different than three, fi ve or ten years ago. Neil 
Rackham, author of SPIN Selling, was the ultimate harbinger of consultative 
selling in the 1980s, and many others have furthered his initial work over the 
past 30 years&#8212;Lou Schachter, Richard Hodge, , Tom Snyder, and Howard Stevens, to 
name a few. Although consultative sales skills still are very much a core 
competency for any seller, a higher-level skill set is emerging. The next 
generation of selling focuses on accelerating a customer&#8217;s desired business 
results via a unique embodiment of products, services, solutions, expertise, and 
value drivers. BTS has put a label to this new skill set, Accelerator Selling.</p>

<p>
During the last decade, organizations have predominately focused on cutting fat 
from their organizations and driving lean initiatives to reduce costs. Much 
emphasis has been placed on reducing costs to serve in lieu of defi ning how to 
migrate up their customer&#8217;s value chain. Gone are the days of marching sellers 
out to prospects that see no inherent value. The Internet is readily available 
with information and opportunities to self-serve where little to no value is 
realized (by both sales organizations and customers). Thus, the further 
proliferation of inside sales teams, distribution/reseller networks, and 
e-commerce platforms to cut costs and meet the customer where they are with a 
delivery mechanism that meets their needs faster, cheaper&#8212;and easier. Few have 
rallied to work on the other side of the equation, enhancing the skills of their 
team in order to evolve into the status of a trusted advisor.</p>
<p>
Creating an A-game means a returned interest in assessing the condition of your 
ship, your crew&#8217;s morale and skills, as well as developing a new plan of attack. 
Opportunities exist to switch strategy from a defensive to an offensive one. 
Take stock of the level of sales skills your sellers actually practice. 
Determine whether those skill sets measure up to your plan to strike 
strategically. If the skills don&#8217;t match the plan, or you aren&#8217;t certain, 
consult with experts in the fi eld to assist in taking an objective assessment 
of your team.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Key Insights:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>All organizations can and will focus on expense reductions to drive cost 
	to serve down.<br>
	Define areas to migrate up the value chain of your customers to drive profi 
	table growth<br>
	from those customers who are willing to pay premiums for expertise, 
	insights, and business<br>
	impact created by your team.</li>
	<li>If you plan to migrate up the value chain, ensure your team has the 
	right skills to garner<br>
	credibility and execute at higher levels.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
New Buying Patterns: &#8220;Herding Cats&#8221; Is Easier</h2>
<p>
Major buying decisions are rarely handled by one individual or even a few. Many 
organizations call for crossfunctional buying committees for large project buys 
and even smaller, seemingly mundane ones. These committees embody competing 
interests, requirements, and a dichotomy of success factors as well as intended 
business impact. Interests are heightened across multiple functions on a large 
majority of purchases as many have become mission-critical given emaciated 
budgets, proliferation of interlinked systems, processes, and initiatives 
spanning multiple departments. &#8220;Herding cats&#8221; can be an easier task than selling 
effectively to these groups. The challenges facing sales teams employing &#8220;status 
quo&#8221; skill sets are compounded by the growing complexity of selling, which 
necessitates new skills in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Facilitation and presentation skills for conducting meetings (&#8220;Mega 
	Meetings&#8221;) for all key customer stakeholders</li>
	<li>Deeper understanding of the customer&#8217;s business in order to create value 
	across functional interests, not competing solely on a 
	product/solution/price basis</li>
	<li>New questioning models which focus on capitalizing on opportunities 
	creating linkages to a customer&#8217;s business results, not just developing and 
	solving for myopic needs which are seen as uncorrelated to key business 
	drivers</li>
	<li>Expert skills to extract, understand, clarify, coalesce, and create 
	real-time alignment across varying points of view into one set of decision 
	criteria, outcomes, and metrics for success</li>
</ul>
<p>
Those organizations who can most effectively manage the challenges of this new 
reality will become frontrunners in their respective markets. Shaping your 
team&#8217;s skill set to meet these new, more complex customer environments is within 
range, but it takes a laser-focus.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Key Insights:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Determine what your customers value&#8212;beyond good price and service&#8212;and 
	arm your sales team to deliver on this value. </li>
	<li>Determine how your customers want to buy and interact with your sales 
	organization- Dividing customers by size is becoming passé.</li>
	<li>Increase the wattage of your team&#8217;s skill sets to meet them head on 
	throughout your customer&#8217;s buying process.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Greatest Lever to Pull for ROI: Frontline Sales Leaders</h2>
<p>Consider the following equation:</p>
<p class="quote"><i>Results = (Knowledge + Skill + Process) x Motivation</i></p>
<p>The most important variable in delivering breakthrough results is motivation. 
Nowhere is this more critical than in sales organizations where motivation is 
the multiplier of all the other variables. Research consistently shows that the 
biggest drivers of motivation are immediate managers. Conversely, the number-one 
reason employees opt out of an organization is directly attributable to their 
immediate manager. These two data points make a simple connection that is often 
skimmed over as organizations look to raise their A-game.</p>
<p>Most sales training initiatives seeking transformation to an A-Game focus on 
variables such as content, learning objectives, participant experience, meals, 
and delivery mechanisms. Additionally, emphasis is typically on frontline sales 
professionals, whereas sales leadership is an afterthought. Leaving managers as 
an afterthought or worse, not building their skill sets in tandem with their 
team, is hazardous. Research indicates that without sales managers becoming an 
enrolled captain who immediately reinforces, coaches, and demonstrates the new 
behaviors amongst their team , 87% of their investment is gone within 30 days.</p>
<p>A sales manager&#8217;s ability to create buy-in and motivation by coaching and 
developing their team&#8217;s skills are cornerstones in creating world-class, 
results-oriented teams. As such, improving the skill sets of your frontline 
sellers without doing the same with your sales leaders is hazardous. Without 
including them in the development plan initially as well as on an ongoing basis 
often leads to compromised returns on investments, and more often than not, 
failed attempts at changing seller behavior. Failed efforts in changing behavior 
create organizational disruption, negative impacts on business results and worse 
yet, backpedaling in an organization&#8217;s overall strategic intent, whether 
internally or market-facing.</p>
<h2>Life Rafts for the Great Ones Left</h2>
<h3>Key Insights:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pull the most under-leveraged, but most powerful lever available in the 
	pursuit of positive, sustained behavioral shifts, the sales management team. 
	</li>
	<li>Empower sales management with the knowledge, skills, and tools to create 
	positive, intentional change which aligns to strategic goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ability of organizations to invest time, resources, and capital into 
thinking, planning, and executing strategically has taken a hit. The order of 
today has overridden the order of thinking of tomorrow&#8217;s plan. The ability to 
maneuver away from disaster has buoyed organizations in rough waters. However 
with so many course corrections, dramatic changes in course, no strategy other 
than survival, along with headcount reductions, and increased role 
responsibility, individual contributors have become dazed and confused.</p>
<p>From executive sales leadership to line sales, everyone has experienced the 
impact of the economic downturn whether it be in the bank account, in morale 
depletion, or general fatigue. Quota attainment and the trajectory to hit the 
numbers have been exhausting. A collective sigh of relief can be felt in the 
sales ranks as the worst seas seem to be behind us. For those left on deck the 
storm has been weathered and clearer skies are in within sight.</p>
<p>For those remaining on deck, most are desiring of praise, investment in their 
development, and feeling like valued contributors. These factors, in tandem with 
the pervasive micromanagement of opportunities and sales pipelines during the do 
or die times in the height of the recession, can come home to roost in unwanted 
turnover. To retain your top talent post recession, take stock of their morale. 
Work to boost their levels of engagement in order to ward off unwanted 
attrition. Improving engagement and commitment are critical tonics needed to 
upright the ship and return it to splendor. Those organizations who can take a 
moment, and not a moment longer than their competitors to create a renewed sense 
of camaraderie, commitment, and engagement, have the opportunity to jumpstart 
their journey to recovery and even leap-frog their competition through quick 
action.</p>
<h3>Key Insights:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Re-engage your crew by buoying the value of their contributions, 
	demonstrating appreciation for their efforts in the battle.</li>
	<li>Light the fuse to empower the team to actualize a strategy to leap-frog 
	your competition.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Set course for the horizon, engage all hands on deck and unfurl the sails of 
your tall ships...</h2>
<h2>
&nbsp;&#8230;while your competition is still anchored in the harbor of the past.</h2>
<p>
The net of this forever changed sales &#8220;seascape&#8221; is about leveraging 
opportunities with speed and agility. The winds have calmed and so too have the 
waves. This has created an opportunity for organizations to re-focus and 
re-energize their teams in order to drive break-through results by creating a 
new A-game. Those organizations able to re-energize and re-tool rapidly, and 
before their competition does, will sail away with success.</p>
<p>
Take risks, but heed the experts. Refocus on those things critical to charting a 
newly defi ned course by developing a deeper understanding of your customer&#8217;s 
business, their processes, their defi nition of value, and your sales 
organization&#8217;s value to them. Develop your team&#8212;all of them, sellers&#8212;and sales 
leaders. Take stock of those who have waged war for you in the most challenging 
economic times and re-engage them to stave off yet another battle in the war for 
talent. Take this opportunity NOW to build your A team and head out to sea.</p>
