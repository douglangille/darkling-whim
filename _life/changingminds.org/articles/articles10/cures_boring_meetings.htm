Unusual Cures for Boring Meetings</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Thejendra BS</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not even 10:00 am on Monday morning and it is already time to rush into 
one of those dreadful weekly status report meetings, a ritual that started 
sometime in your previous birth. You know for sure that no one will have 
anything substantial to report, or a few trumpeters will hype up their trivial 
tasks, or someone will hijack the whole meeting, or a few egos will get bruised, 
and the meetings will go on till eternity or until your bladders burst. Besides 
those umpteen cups of coffee, tea and biscuits are fast taking you many steps 
closer to indigestion and ulcers. Everyday millions of people waste time on 
useless meetings that serve no purpose. And non stop meetings are one of the 
most life draining and unavoidable activities of the corporate world, standing 
only next to performance appraisals in toxicity. In many organizations a stage 
has been reached where the very mention of the word meeting is equated with 
something that is boring and life draining. Today many managers and employees go 
to office just to attend meetings throughout the day without getting a chance to 
do any meaningful work. For example, in some organizations even the most trivial 
of tasks cannot be done without first calling a meeting, then a second meeting 
and countless other meetings. Agreed, meetings and conference calls are 
necessary to run things, but instead of running things they usually end up 
stopping things from happening. Also, another big challenge for the meeting 
initiators is to keep all the attendees awake. </p>
<p>Thinking out of the box, have you every asked yourself why do all team 
meetings have to revolve only around status reports, reorganizations, metrics, 
jargon filled presentations, performance appraisals, process improvements, 
customer complaints, finding scapegoats, etc? Well, you may loudly argue that is 
what the business is all about. So meetings are necessary whether people like it 
or not. True, some meetings are unavoidable and absolutely necessary to run the 
business. But as a manager in charge of leading (and sometimes inspiring) a team 
what can you do to make your team meetings more enjoyable, knowledge oriented 
and almost a pure joy for everyone? What is the magic pill to make meetings more 
exciting, produce better results and gradually eliminate the need for routine 
meetings? </p>
<p>It is quite simple. Have more meetings, but of a different variety. Apart 
from essential departmental meetings periodically have at least 20-30% of your 
team meetings that have nothing to do with your business or customer issues. </p>
<p>Now you may again loudly argue that you are not paid by your management or 
the customer to do such meetings as they have nothing to do with the business. 
Besides who will have time or money for all that stuff? But the unique meetings 
I am going to recommend can take you to a different dimension of business 
improvement and people management skills, well beyond the dry fodder that is fed 
as management best practices everywhere. </p>
<p>Have a look at the topics suggested below. </p>
<ol>
	<li><b>Inspirational quotes meeting</b>: Have a meeting where you read, enjoy and 
discuss hundreds of great, inspirations quotes of various leaders around the 
world. Such quotes contain wisdom and advice that has withstood the test of 
time. Many quotes contain fantastic management wisdom. There have been numerous 
cases where a single inspirational quote has completely changed the life of many 
people. For example a quote like, &quot;It is a terrible thing to look over your 
shoulder when you are trying to lead and find no one there-Franklin Roosevelt,&quot; 
or &quot;There will be a time when loud-mouthed, incompetent people will seem to be 
getting the best of you. When that happens, you only have to be patient and wait 
for them to self-destruct. It never fails-Richard Rybolt,&quot; can start a very 
interesting conversation and self awareness. </li>
	<li><b>Stress Management Meeting</b>: Discuss and brainstorm useful and practicable 
stress management techniques that can be practiced within and outside the 
workplace. For example, a simple technique like a proper breathing exercise can 
be a great knowledge and productivity enhancer to the team to deal with stress 
caused by various workplace issues. </li>
	<li><b>Life of a Great Leader Meeting</b>: Have a meeting where you study the life of 
one or more great world non business leaders and freedom fighters like Lincoln, 
Churchill, Gandhi, Mother Teresa, Rosa Parks or even Hitler. The lives of non 
business leaders around the world and the kind of troubles they have endured can 
have a terrific impact on your life. For example, the perseverance of Nelson 
Mandela who spent 27 years rotting in jail can make you feel like your workplace 
troubles are nothing compared to what some people have suffered. </li>
	<li><b>Gift a Book Meeting</b>: Most employees, including managers, don't read good 
books relating to management, history, religion, self help, etc. This is why 
there are so many workplace problems worldwide. But reading and re-reading a 
good book can take you to a different level of professionalism, confidence, 
business improvement techniques, etc., that can help both the business and the 
individual. For example, have your team members gift each other a good self help 
or management book to each other by investing invests ten dollars every two 
months. </li>
	<li><b>Family and Health Issues Meeting</b>: Have a meeting that can openly discuss 
family problems and health tips. People often avoid discussing family and 
personal health issues openly as they consider it as washing dirty linen in 
public. But if you can overcome that strong inertia and slowly start discussing 
whatever is discussable it can often provide valuable insights into a person's behavior and understand each other. Each employee is unique with his or her own 
personal problems that can impact their style of work. For example, on a lighter 
sense employees with no kids can perhaps understand why employees with naughty 
kids grow bald faster or cannot take work home. Often nobody knows or admits 
openly that the health condition of an employee's family member can also play an 
important role in an employee's concentration and productivity in an 
organization. People often think that employees should leave their family 
problems at their homes. But it is not that easy nor humane to ignore family 
issues as everyone will have some pressing problem or the other. Such issues can 
have a serious impact on a person's overall concentration, productivity and 
contribution to an organization. For example, I have seen how a young team 
member of mine lose his concentration and interest in work due to a family 
member's terminal disease that lasted for nearly two years. But the question you 
should ask is can such an employee be punished for poor performance or should 
the team pitch in to lift his or her spirits and take teamwork to the next 
generation? </li>
	<li><b>Financial Planning Meeting</b>: Discuss ways in which team members can learn 
and enforce proper financial planning in their lives. Various studies have 
proved that most people know nothing about proper financial planning or its 
importance. They could be getting a great salary but saving practically nothing. 
But when the Damocles sword falls on their head it will be too late to do 
anything. You need to save for a rainy day to prevent serious trouble for 
yourself and your dependants and family members. Similar to an organization's 
disaster recovery and business continuity plans, it is important for you to have 
a personal disaster recovery and livelihood continuity plan. Enough money in the 
bank and other safe investments provides you that much need mental strength to 
handle workplace harassments, including job losses. Anything unexpected may 
happen to you at any time, and that is why it is important to save some money 
for emergencies through proper financial planning. </li>
	<li><b>Work Life Balance Meeting</b>: Discuss ways in which you can enforce work life 
balance to improve everyone's health. Today everyone talks about work life 
balance, but nothing substantial happens in any department. In my umpteen years 
in the workplace I have never come across any real management sponsored 
mechanism to reduce stress and improve health of employees. And, I have never 
seen any HR representative walk across the floors and chase employees out at 
5:00 pm or on weekends so that they go home to enjoy a proper work life balance. 
	</li>
	<li><b>Hobbies Meeting</b>: Discuss hobbies and interests of team members. You may be 
surprised to know the existence of great talent within your own teams that can 
be exploited and nurtured for mutual benefit. </li>
	<li><b>Video Meetings</b>: Today excellent DVDs are available containing speeches, 
presentations and coaching sessions on a variety of business and self help 
topics prepared by management gurus and reputed authors. Normally such videos 
are expensive but worth every penny as they can be very interesting and highly 
educational. Every department library should have a good collection of such DVDs 
and periodic video sessions can be arranged for the benefit of all your team 
members. Similarly, countless useful and beneficial topics like email etiquette, humor &amp; harassment in the workplace, handling rude customers, charity, useful 
electronic gadgets, household tips, first aid, and even philosophy, etc., can be 
discussed to everyone's benefit. </li>
</ol>
<p>Each of the above topics has the indirect potential to help the employee as 
well as the business. Very soon the knowledge gained in such meetings can pay 
rich dividends, both to the employee and the organization. They can also inject 
a superior level of self consciousness that can help you inside and outside the 
workplace, and also gradually reduce the need for moronic business meetings. Get 
suggestions from various employees for unique topics. Always try to choose 
topics that can attract many people without much prodding. But not everyone may 
be interested in every topic. If somebody is not interested in a particular 
topic don't force them. Keep the duration short, sweet and at moderate intervals 
like once a month to make every meeting a refreshing and memorable one. </p>
<p>Now who would like to attend an exciting meeting on, &quot;<i>Fungus wilt caused 
on Pseudomonas Solanacearum by Calonectria and Cylindrocladium Spathiphylli 
bacteria in eastern Cambodia?</i>&quot; </p>
