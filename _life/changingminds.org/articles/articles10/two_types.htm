<h1>Two Types of Decisions: Buy-IN, and BuyING</h1>

Two Types of Decisions: Buy-IN, and BuyING</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently someone told me that Buying Facilitation? is an old concept, that 
its been written about in books since sales books have been written, and that 
he&#8217;s been helping buyer&#8217;s buy for decades. Of course he has, except that he, 
like the entire sales field, has a paltry success rate &#8211; certainly under 10%. 
Why? If the seller understands the need, has the right solution, and has a great 
relationship, what&#8217;s stopping the buyer from buying as often as they should? Why 
isn&#8217;t the buyer deciding on the obvious solution? </p>
<p>Indeed, I just heard a statistic that in mature prospecting situations in 
which sellers are waiting for a close, at least 20% of these situations don&#8217;t 
close due to &#8216;no decision.&#8217; But a decisions has been made! It&#8217;s &#8216;We Have Decided 
Not To Buy Your Solution From You At This Time.&#8217; So it is a decision. It&#8217;s just 
not the one you wanted. Or it&#8217;s possible that you never had a buyer to begin 
with, and have either told your managers you&#8217;d be closing, or convinced yourself 
that you have a buyer when you really don&#8217;t. </p>
<p>And I&#8217;m not even discussing the 30% that are in line to close but choose 
another vendor&#8230;. a waste because they didn&#8217;t know how to choose you. And what 
about those that you lost well before they got in line to be READY to close? The 
entire sales process is a giant waste of time and energy! </p>
<h2>TWO DECISIONS</h2>
<p>Buyers have two types of decisions. One is the focus of our sales efforts: 
the decision to buy a solution. Of course this has been written about for 
decades. But the other set of decisions they must make is around buy-in: until 
or unless all of the people, policies, relationships (partners, vendors, rules, 
etc) buy in to bringing something new in, nothing will happen and no buying 
decision will be made. These decisions are private and idiosyncratic, and we sit 
and wait for them to happen. Sales does not manage this. </p>
<p>I call the facilitation of these non-solution-oriented decisions &#8211; the 
behind-the-scenes decision issues that have nothing to do with the Identified 
Problem - Buying Facilitation?. You can call it anything you want. But until or 
unless a buyer recognizes and manages these often-unconscious decision issues 
necessary to get group/company buy-in, buyers won&#8217;t choose a solution. </p>
<p>This is where our prospects go when they don&#8217;t choose us: they get caught in 
their internal relationships and politics, their old vendors, their status quo. 
And the sales model does not handle this. It never has. </p>
<h2>WHAT&#8217;S GOING ON BEHIND-THE-SCENES</h2>
<p>Before you showed up with the perfect solution, the buyer&#8217;s environment (I 
call it a system) worked&#8230; well, it worked the way it worked. The problem we can 
resolve with our solution is not an isolated event: it sits within the buyer&#8217;s 
system as a piece of the pie, an ingredient if you will, not the whole pie. The 
system has accepted it and has created work-arounds for it. In other words, the 
problem we can resolve is not a big problem to the system. We see it as such 
because we concentrate on it so we can sell. But if the system was being harmed 
by it, it would have fixed it already </p>
<p>It is only when the problem becomes an annoyance to the rest of the system 
that the buyer is willing to do something different. At that point, not only 
does must it choose a solution, but because the problem has been embedded and 
touches so many parts of the system, it must manage the work-arounds that were 
created along the way to make sure the system kept working with the problem in 
it. A decision to bring in a new solution (a buying decision) is a change 
management activity. </p>
<p>A decision to buy a solution must be backed by the full force of the 
team/group/company/family, otherwise the fall-out would harm the originating 
group and not be worth it. If the head of training will quit because she doesn&#8217;t 
want the new vendor to &#8216;do her job&#8217; or if the tech team will not be able to 
integrate the new software or if the management team is wary of having outsiders 
come in, no buying decision will be made. The system is sacrosanct. </p>
<h2>SALES FOLKS THINK IT&#8217;S ABOUT THE SOLUTION</h2>
<p>Sales is necessary to help manage the needs assessment and solution placement 
AFTER the buyer has navigated through all of their decision issues. 
Unfortunately, buyers don&#8217;t know at the start what sorts of issues they&#8217;re going 
to have to handle. That&#8217;s where we come in. With an entirely new/different skill 
set &#8211; NOT SALES as I repeatedly say in my new book Dirty Little Secrets &#8211; it&#8217;s 
possible to be a GPS system for your buyer and help them navigate through their 
decision issues. Not toward a solution, necessarily. But toward a resolution of 
the factors they need to address to get buy-in. First help buyers make their 
buyIN decisions, and then you can help them make their buyING decisions. </p>
<p>Buying Facilitation? is not sales: it does not do needs assessment; it does 
not do solution placement; it does not manage objections (but it mitigates 
them). But it will make you first a decision facilitator and true consultant, 
will differentiate you from your competition, and it will help buyers make 
decisions 80% faster. Buyers have to do all of this anyway, with you or without 
you. And the time it takes them is the length of the sales cycle. You&#8217;re already 
waiting for them &#8211; you might has well offer them true leadership while you&#8217;re 
waiting (It&#8217;s not sales. It&#8217;s not sales.). </p>
