The Relationship between Masculine/Feminine and Parent/Child Dynamics</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Toby Jensen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People watching is a popular pastime for many of us. It is intriguing and you 
get to judge others. The mystery of what another person is like draws us 
together while the judgmental human nature that most people display allows us to 
think we are better than others. Most people don&#8217;t know why some people 
instantly make them angry or why a strong dislike for certain people emerges at 
first meeting. Most people get along well. Some people are only slightly 
irritating. But some people are offensive the moment they walk into the room. 
While from their perspective they may like you or not care a whit about you. 
They may even hate you the moment they see you &#8211; all this happens even before 
anyone has said a word. The reason is found in personality profiling. It is in 
distinctly differing personalities that people almost instantly like, hate, or 
become indifferent toward one another. Few of us, however, truly know how to be 
fair and accurate in determining how another person runs their life. Uniqueness 
is fascinating. This article explains how someone can be different from you and 
not be wrong or worthless.<p>
Towards the end of 1999 Albert Einstein was chosen to be Time magazine&#8217;s &#8220;Person 
of the Century&#8221;. It was because of him that we now reap the rewards today of his 
great advances in science and technology. Ongoing generations will continue to 
learn the mysteries of the nature of the universe as a result of his genius work 
in physics and math. What is fascinating is how his personality drove his great 
intellect. It was his innate desire, his personality, which began the desire to 
learn and kept a desire to continue to learn as a focus throughout his life. It 
was not his great intellectual advances that made him famous it was his 
personality that led to his popularity and acceptance. We remember Einstein. And 
because we remember him we then remember his great work. While Einstein is 
remembered for being smart other people are remembered for their different 
personality traits. Some people such as Oprah are known for being popular while 
others such as Michael Jordan or Donald Trump are known for being powerful. <p>
Most scientists make a decent living. They are not, however, usually found to be 
very wealthy. Good grades in school does not mean you are likely to succeed, in 
fact, it is actually a detriment once a &#8220;good&#8221; student leaves school. We live in 
a people world and people skills reward far greater on many levels than pure 
intellect. Sadly most &#8220;smart&#8221; people struggle in life simply because they are 
unable to read a person&#8217;s personality and be able to respond to that person 
appropriately bringing out the best in others and themselves. Highly successful 
people reach their high status simply due to being able to assess another&#8217;s 
personality characteristics, understand how they work and then use that 
information to further the growth needed to achieve greatness. <p>
Oprah, one of the most well paid people in the world, is incredible at 
understanding what women want. There is very little math and science in her 
show. It is her ability to understand what most women enjoy that drives her 
success. Without this understanding of a woman&#8217;s interests she easily would have 
been just another talk show. <p>
Michael Jordan, one of the greatest basketball players of all time, knew the 
value of understanding who he was playing against. He learned strengths and 
weaknesses and applied the knowledge he gained in every game he played. He knew 
who he was playing against every time which drove him to winning the NBA 
Championship six times. For those who didn&#8217;t understand his drive to win - lost.
<p>
The value of people skills far out way the rewards for intellectual 
understanding in our society.<p>
All these different personality books all come back to the same thing. Once you 
learn the basic four you can profile yourself, anyone else and understand where 
they are coming from and what they are talking about. <p>
Imagine getting into a romantic relationship with the person of your dreams. It 
starts out great. You are swept off your feet with romantic gestures and 
attentiveness. Then as the relationship progresses, personality problems begin 
to emerge. At first you try to shrug it off as they might be having a bad day. 
But things become obviously wrong after some time. Your partner has become needy 
and is smothering you, which leads to possessiveness, suspicion, and jealousy. 
It may even come to exploitation and manipulation. Or it sometimes goes in the 
opposite direction - becoming fearful of abandonment. Whatever the problems are 
if you understand personality types you can learn what to expect in a 
relationship and finally move one into being in the relationship you&#8217;ve dreamed 
about. Fail to learn to deal with people and you fail in life. <p>
The ability to identify, assess, and manage your psychological state, that of 
others, and groups can only be developed and mastered by understanding and 
applying personality traits in a healthy way. Often and amazingly a healthy way 
is determined quite differently by different personality types. It is also 
amazing how different people pick back up after setbacks, change, and carrying 
on to become incredibly successful in different ways. <p>
Every day millions of people (if not hundreds of millions) become frustrated and 
miserable as a result of having had to deal with intensely difficult people. 
Manipulators, codependent, know-it-alls, or maybe just somebody who has to talk 
all the time often can become very trying. It is through healing our 
inadequacies and then learning to apply the skills of communication that we can 
only help others. Often we may learn something from someone else first but it is 
also quite common to apply our own intelligence in figuring things out. How we 
do this is through our own personal preferences. <p>
<p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This article is written to review the popular personality traits while 
adding, for the first time in the history of the world, the connection of 
masculine/feminine and parent/child characteristics together at the same time. 
To learn what the relationship is between all four - masculine, feminine, 
parent, child and how they work together. It is through the heat of opposition 
that the truth is tempered and becomes strengthened in you. Once it becomes a 
part of who you are you are able to finally use it in ways to further the growth 
of this world far more than was previously thought possible. May you tear 
through this article, dissecting, arguing, and weighing the insights for 
validity, performance, and depth in such a way that it becomes a part of you to 
use at will for the benefit of the world. <p>
Personality is your greatest force that guides you through life, and the greater 
your self-awareness, the more able you are to use personality to achieve your 
fullest potential. Ignoring whether you are introverted or extroverted quickly 
leads to a life of failure and misery. Understanding such an obvious personality 
trait is vital in determining how you want to live a successful life. Imagine if 
not only did you not understand the difference between introverted and 
extroverted in yourself but you could also not determine it in others. You would 
live a life of constant frustration and misery never knowing what to do. 
Understanding others helps you to understand yourself leading to an even better 
understanding of others. Everyone is a special, unique, and delicate snowflake. 
There are no two exactly alike. People are born with strengths and weaknesses 
that are honed and developed further by the life they live. What works for one 
may not work for another. The same action may have little if any success with 
another while at the same time can have destructive results when applied by 
another. By learning how personality traits work you learn how to master life.
<p>
The origins of this article on DiSC Personality Profiling truly began almost a 
hundred years ago by William Moulton Marston PhD in 1928 when he wrote the book 
Emotions of Normal People. It was the first work ever done of normal healthy 
people. Up until this time understanding of human behavior was done from the 
study of criminals and the mentally ill. The first known recorded quadrant of 
four personality types was first done by Hippocrates twenty-four hundred years 
ago when he determined that there are four basic groupings of personality 
traits. <p>
The measurement of four traits can be seen universally throughout history and 
the world.<p>
A compass contains four main cardinal points &#8211; north, south, east, and west. In 
order to go anywhere in the world you must know where it is in relation to these 
four points. <p>
Science has even gone on to name the way the simplest particles in the universe 
interact with one another. There are four. The known fundamental interactions of 
the universe are gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear force, and strong 
nuclear force. <p>
Some of us like to live life in black and white. Astonishment and amazement 
arise when we first realize there are shades of gray. It is astounding to see 
the look on a person&#8217;s face who discovers color for the first time &#8211; four areas 
of life. <p>
The personal development field and psychology consistently recognize four areas 
of life: social, intellectual, spiritual, and physical. Often these points are 
renamed or a section of one area is highlighted as its own area. It is almost 
universally recognized that when these four areas are not in balance and harmony 
for that individual then the person is not considered to be healthy. In order to 
accomplish anything a person must move through four areas &#8211; thinking, feeling, 
action, results. No one does anything without thinking about it first. Our 
thoughts give rise to our emotions which drive our actions producing results.
<p>
The four areas of Taijitu (yin yang) are fundamental to Eastern philosophy. Yin 
yang gives us a description of how polar or seemingly contrary forces are 
interconnected and interdependent displaying the equality, balance, and harmony 
of the natural world. Describing how they give rise to each other in turn is the 
basis for the origin of eastern science as well. While most recognize the yin 
yang symbol which depicts male and female the dot on the other side completes 
it. Opposite and equal. When one aspect reaches it full peak it naturally and 
automatically begins to transform into its opposite. Opposite and complementary. 
Or two points of view to a single reality. Each aspect of yin and yang can be 
further subdivided into yin and yang aspects. Each contains the seed of the 
other centered within itself, which is why we see a black spot of Yin in the 
white Yang and vice versa. The spot centered within creates the third and fourth 
aspects of yin yang. <p>
Yin and yang are usually held in balance--as one increases, the other decreases. 
However, imbalances can occur. There are four possible imbalances: Excess yin, 
excess yang, yin deficiency, yang deficiency. They do not merely replace each 
other but actually become each other through the constant flow of the universe.
<p>
Four states of matter. Solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. Water, the foundation of 
life, being the only element to exist in all four states of liquid, solid (ice), 
steam, and super heated it becomes plasma. Imagine enjoying a glass of ice water 
on a humid day and you don&#8217;t sit in awe of the wonder of it all. <p>
The ultimate proof of four areas governing everything is found in quantum 
mechanics. Quantum mechanics is very easy to explain. It is the study of 
probabilities which means that what you probably think will happen is probably 
what is going to happen. The subject really came to light when two groups of 
scientists were arguing over whether light (ie. sunlight) was made up of 
particle or waves. To most regular people the question is rather silly because 
you can&#8217;t see light. You can only see what light is shining on. Well, 
scientists, in their ever questioning analysis of the details of the universe 
discovered that indeed light is made up of something and they were arguing 
whether it was waves or particles. The argument went on for some time until one 
scientist from the particle supporting group invited a scientist from the wave 
supporting group to look into his own analysis of light. Particle scientist 
asked wave scientist to simply give it a possibility that he might see particles 
when he looked. Wave scientist then proceeded to look into particle scientist&#8217;s 
analysis and what seemed miraculous was he saw particles of light! Once a wave 
scientist gave it a possibility to see particles that made up light that is what 
he saw. Wave scientist then thinking this was some kind of trick asked the same 
thing of particle scientist. He brought particle scientist over to his own 
experiments of looking at light. And particle scientist then saw waves in the 
light. What proved it was when wave scientist looked at his own project and then 
saw particles in the very light only a moment before that was waves. Both then 
went back to particle scientist&#8217;s project and both saw waves. This is the 
essence of quantum mechanics. What you believe will happen is probably what will 
happen. For the first time science was now accounting for &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221;. Up 
until this time science was completely based in fact &#8211; yes or no. Up until this 
time computers were based on yes or no, on or off, or more commonly known as 
one&#8217;s and zero&#8217;s. For the first time scientists began accounting for yes, no, 
maybe, and I don&#8217;t know all existing at the same time. Science finally proved 
what spirituality has taught for centuries. That what you believe will happen is 
probably what will happen. No matter how weird or strange or difficult you may 
think this is doesn&#8217;t even matter. What matters is that it works. It is from the 
science of quantum mechanics that we have CD&#8217;s, DVD&#8217;s, lasers, and put 
satellites into space. It simply works. And it all happened about a hundred 
years ago. <p>
Some may think personality profiling outdated, obsolete, or old fashioned 
because officially it was developed about a hundred years ago. It is no more 
obsolete than quantum mechanics. Certainly it can be added too and that is what 
this article is about &#8211; the combination of the masculine and the feminine with 
the parent and child. Quantum mechanics is now giving way to string theory and 
even more advanced ideas about how the universe works but they are all still 
added onto quantum mechanics NOT replacing it. <p>
The universe comes in four parts. By always looking for all for parts when 
living life then a more complete picture of how life works comes into view. An 
easy way to do it is to remember the four most commonly used areas of life: 
physical (financial), social (emotional), spiritual (soul), intellectual 
(intelligence). </p>
<p>Often the subcategory of financial is broken out into its own category. If it 
is still seen as just a subcategory being brought into focus then a healthy 
perspective is still maintained. Unfortunately it is often thought of as its own 
category or even the only category. By realizing how focus can be used in a 
healthy way it is easy to determine the proper perspective in life concerning 
money. It is part of the physical category as the physical category is part of 
the larger perspective also containing social, spiritual, and intellectual. </p>
<p>Another confusing perspective is when there are only three categories 
mentioned. Spiritual people can easily forget the physical part of life. Often 
monks take vows of poverty intending to simply erase the whole category of 
physical. The physical part of life is more than just money. It is also our 
bodies and our world that we live in. To take a vow of poverty is to attempt to 
erase not just needing a bank account &#8211; it is also an attempt to erase our 
physical needs of our bodies to eat, drink, and sleep. It is the beginning of 
the attempt to erase our need of even having to live within this physical world. 
Although striving to overcome the world is admirable, actually overcoming the 
world is done in a different manner than trying to eliminate a whole section of 
life. It is in learning to live in harmony and balance in the four areas. <p>
<p>
<p>
</p>
<p>All readily recognize that there are inherent differences between men and 
women. The subject is fairly popular being covered by several authors such as 
John Gray, Alison Armstrong, and David Deida to name a few. As much as men and 
women are different physically they are also just as different mentally, 
emotionally, and spiritually. These are the four basic areas all personal 
development has built upon for hundreds of years &#8211; physical, intellectual, 
social, and spiritual. It is even commonly acknowledged that most people 
recognize that they have a masculine and feminine side. Although traditionally 
reluctant to admit it, men are coming forward to not only embrace their feminine 
side but too also learn to nurture and protect it as a strong healthy man. Women 
have encountered their masculine side most predominantly by entering the male 
dominated work force where masculinity is strongly encouraged. Certainly many 
similarities come into play between men and women causing confusion and 
difficulty in relationships. And while understanding the differences between men 
and women is gaining in popularity in vast strides more and more people are also 
beginning to understand the second relationship between parent and child. <p>
The parent/child relationship refers to the widely used childlike aspect of a 
person&#8217;s inner psyche. Typically referred to as &#8216;my inner child&#8217; it is the 
relationship between seeking the adult within that encourages responsibility, 
standards, analysis, and quality as compared to the child that seeks 
entertainment, joy, popularity, enthusiasm, and freedom of expression. The outer 
expression of the same relationship is obvious in parents giving birth to 
children and raising them.<p>
Now for the first time these two relationships have been combined together to 
advance the four categories of DiSC Personality Profiling. DiSC is the four 
quadrant behavioral model based on the work of William Moulton Marston which 
examined the behavior of individuals in their environment or within a specific 
situation. It therefore focuses on the styles and preferences of such behavior. 
He named the four vectors of behavior, namely Assertiveness, Sociability, 
Tranquility, and Dependence, and the means to identify the relative tendency of 
individuals to behave according to these predictive scales. Research has found 
that characteristics of behavior can be grouped into these four major 
personality styles and tend to exhibit specific characteristics common to that 
particular style. All individuals possess all four patterns of behavior, but 
what differs from one to another is the extent of each. This system of 
dimensions of observable behavior has become known as the universal language of 
behavior. It is being used today by most personality assessments worldwide in 
almost every personality test ever given. Each of these four types has its own 
unique goal, value to the team, ideal environment, emotional state, influence, 
and how they are motivated. <p>
DiSC Personality Profiles are based on a four-quadrant model that reliably 
describes four styles of human behavior by testing a person's preferences. DISC 
is an acronym for: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Dominance &#8211; relating to control, power, and assertiveness</li>
	<li>Influence &#8211; relating to social situations and communication</li>
	<li>Steadiness &#8211; relating to submission, patience, persistence, and 
	thoughtfulness</li>
	<li>Conscientiousness &#8211; relating to caution, compliance, structure, and 
	organization<p>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>ome people fall into one style, others fall into two, and some may fall into 
three. Nobody is active in all four at the same time.</p>
<p>From here we can now see the four quadrants explained in detail. The 
dominance quadrant shows traits of power, control, results, challenge, and 
solving problems. This is obviously the masculine quadrant. Opposite to that 
would be the feminine quadrant which is the steadiness quadrant. Here the 
qualities of patience, helping others, a good listener, creating harmony, 
amiable, patient, harmonious, friendly, accommodating, and modest are most 
prominent. Opposite of these two quadrants we have conscientious and influence - 
conscientious being the parental quadrant with influence being the child 
quadrant. Conscientious people adhere to rules, standards, concentrate, think 
analytically, check for accuracy, and are systematic in details &#8211; clearly the 
rule bound style of parental behavior. Opposite is the child quadrant which 
contains personality traits of being social, enthusiasm, entertaining, optimism 
with people &#8211; fun is the key factor here. From these four quadrants we now have 
a new refreshing new view of how we fit together. <p>
By adding parent/child to the natural popularity of studying differences between 
men and women we finally have a complete picture. These are the four factors in 
the human race - the four factors in family. Of course a family can have less 
than all four factors &#8211; it just can&#8217;t have more or anything else. <p>
The first question everyone asks is - How do women stay feminine in a D 
personality and how do men stay masculine in an S personality? Are you mixing 
and confusing the genders by applying masculine tendencies to women and feminine 
qualities to men? Everyone has long known that there are happy fulfilled 
masculine women, feminine men, adults who play as little children, and children 
who display all these characteristics. It is a personality trait not the 
determining of sexuality. <p>
&nbsp;<p>
D &#8211; strong woman, strong man<p>
I &#8211; playful man, playful woman<p>
S &#8211; gentle man, gentle woman<p>
C &#8211; men&#8217;s rules, woman&#8217;s rules<p>
&nbsp;<p>
Some women are strong and powerful while other women are gentle and feminine. 
Are you going to look at powerfully strong D woman negatively or as the 
confident women who know what they want and go get it? Or can you view the 
gentleness of a man who can be strong enough to display charity, forgiveness, 
and gentleness most of the time? From here we can now for the first time gain 
further insight into the differences between men and women by relating them to 
parents and children. From here comes the work of learning and using the ways 
that people want to be treated. </p>
<p>We now understand how to treat people. It is now time to put it into practice 
and do it. </p>
<p>As society matures it becomes easier and much more common place to see at 
least two areas, namely male and female, emerge as complementing opposites. It 
requires more insight and discipline to recognize all four areas together &#8211; 
male, female, parent, child. How often have people seen the pairing of male and 
female or the pairing of parent and child and not recognized that all four go 
together. It is difficult enough just to understand men or women &#8211; only half of 
the full quadrant. The confusing and difficult nature of understanding men and 
women is the basis of many jokes and humor. How they are similar and at the same 
time different. It takes practice enough just to learn to think in duality let 
alone thinking of all four. It is the double duality providing balance one to 
another. It appears complete while at the same time being simple or at least 
simple enough. </p>
