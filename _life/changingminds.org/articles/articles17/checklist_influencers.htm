Checklist for Influencers: questions for sellers, coaches, leaders, change 
agents</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of you are really good at what you do: as influencers, sellers, coaches, 
change agents, or leaders, your intuition, excellent skills, and history of 
success guide your ability to facilitate change for your clients. And yet using 
conventional models and questions it’s inevitable that your interactions will 
have bias, and will unwittingly restrict possible outcomes accordingly. Since 
any bias you enter with will most likely skew the range of answers, the best 
option would be to enter each interaction with as few biases as possible. Here’s 
a checklist of questions to help you determine the extent of bias in your 
interactions:<ul>
	<li>When attempting to influence or lead/coach/influence someone (as sellers, 
leaders, etc.) how can you determine the role your natural assumptions, 
unconscious expectations, and goals play in biasing or restricting the outcome?</li>
	<li>Are you aware of, and make allowances for, your full range of biases? Can 
you think of how your biases might predispose specific outcomes? Do you know 
what you’d need to do differently to enter a conversation without bias or 
assumptions?</li>
	<li>How do you manage your Communication Partner’s (CP) biases and assumptions 
to avoid unconscious resistance, fallout, and restricted choice (not to mention 
lost sales and difficult implementations) and expand choice and possibility?
	</li>
	<li>Are you aware the extent to which your curiosity and questions are 
subjectively biased toward the goal you&#39;ve (un)consciously set that 1. 
potentially precludes a more congruent outcome, 2. alienates many who might need 
your solutions?</li>
	<li>Due to conventional assumptions for information gathering, how can you be 
certain that you’re gathering the most appropriate – and complete – information? 
In other words, are your expectations biasing your outcomes?</li>
	<li>Are you aware of how much your brain filters and miscontrues what you hear 
and how much more is being said/meant than what you think you’re hearing? Are 
you aware of the cost of misunderstanding what’s going on outside of your goals 
and expectations? How much information is available that you&#39;re not asking for 
due to your biases?</li>
	<li>How much of the data you gather turns out to be accurate? How do you know 
when/if you get inaccurate data? How do your expectations and the bias in your 
questions interfere with helping the Other discern their most accurate answers?</li>
	<li>What would you need to believe differently to consider that your current 
skill set, biases, and habitual set of expectations that you enter a 
conversation with are creating a diminished ability to influence the full extent 
of real change and avoid resistance?</li>
	<li>How often do you assume something is ‘working’ or was successful – a 
coaching client was changing, or a buyer was going to buy – and you were wrong 
in your approach or communication? Do you know for certain what happened 
behind-the-scenes that caused the failure and you could have circumvented? And 
if you don’t, what would you have needed to do differently during the interaction(s) to enable more of a collaborative communication?</li>
	<li>Are you aware of how your own biases, assumptions, triggers, and filters, 
have gotten in the way of success – or do you believe you’re right and the other 
person wrong/stupid?</li>
	<li>What would you need to believe differently to be willing to add some new 
skills to use less bias? To enable your CPs to recognize and manage their own 
unconscious beliefs that have informed their choices and would need to be 
shifted for change (a purchase, an implementation) to occur so they can easily 
buy, change or adopt your terrific material?</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>
FACILITATING CHOICE</h2>
	<p>
We’re all in the business of influencing, or attempting to get what we want. Yet 
we fail a very high percentage of the time; sellers lose 95% of their prospects; 
coaches lose 70% of follow on clients; implementations fail 97% of the time. 
It’s not our fault: we fail because our conventional skills are focused on<ul>
		<li>content push</li>
		<li>premature goal setting</li>
		<li>the facilitator’s expectations</li>
		<li>listening for pre-determined details</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
and miss the unspoken metamessages, values, history, rules, and consensus issues 
that make up our CPs status quo. In other words, the biases that we use and 
enter our conversations with biases, and restricts outcomes. It’s possible to 
enable our CP to do their own change work from within (where real change takes 
place), without us biasing and limiting possibility.<p>
So here&#39;s the &#39;pitch&#39;: Using our conventional, habitual skill sets and 
unconscious listening, it&#39;s pretty impossible to enter conversations without 
bias. To that end, I&#39;ve developed a generic change management model (Buying 
Facilitation®) that facilitates decision making and change at the core 
unconscious, systemic level and avoids bias and resistance. <p>
Coding my own Asperger’s systemizing brain over decades, I&#39;ve developed a new 
form of listening, a new type of question, and coded the steps that happen 
unconsciously during all change to add to anyone who seeks to influence change 
in others. For 30 years, I’ve trained it to sales people, coaches, leaders, and 
negotiators globally. I&#39;ve written 7 books on the subject and hundreds of 
articles www.sharondrewmorgen.com. <p>
The model works as an addition to most other coaching, sales, leadership, etc. 
models to help Others determine how to quickly and congruently buy, change, 
implement, etc. themselves in the area you are facilitating. In other words, you 
avoid bias because your job is to help them use their own idiosyncratic system 
of rules and relationships to make their own changes rather than trying to get 
them to do what you want them to do. In other words, you&#39;re helping them 
discover their own Excellence.<p>
Buying Facilitation® is a generic model that enables real change and quicker 
decisions. In sales there are no more delayed sales cycles or lost prospects; in 
change management, you can have successful implementations that get the right 
people, the right issues, involved immediately; coaching clients no long resist 
change. <p>
The new model makes it possible to unhook from your personal biases and enter 
conversations in a way that leads/ discovers/ creates all that&#39;s possible 
through win/win, servant leadership and congruent change. Imagine being able to 
enter every conversation and have it reach its most ethical, financial, and 
creative possibility. Imagine. All you have to do is first be willing to help 
others make their own change, and get rid of your biases.<p>
