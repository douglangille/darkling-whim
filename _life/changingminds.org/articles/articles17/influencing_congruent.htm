Influencing Congruent, Unbiased Change: serving with integrity</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Our jobs as influencers is to help Others achieve their own brand of excellence, 
using their own unique values and standards. Sadly, too many of us – coaches, 
leaders, sellers, consultants, doctors, parents – try to get Others to accede to 
our viewpoints and suggestions, believing we have information or solutions that 
offer ‘better’ choices than the ones they&#39;ve made. We&#39;re telling them, net, net, 
that we’re smarter, that we think our ideas are better than their own.<p>
And the results aren’t pretty: we end up restricting possibility and creating 
resistance, conflict, antagonism, or disregard, regardless of the efficacy of 
what we have to offer. In this article I’ll explain why and how we end up 
creating the very resistance we hope to avoid, and introduce new skills to 
enable us to truly serve. <h2>
WE CONNECT THROUGH OUR OWN SUBJECTIVITY </h2>
<p>
Regardless of the situation, when we try to effect change using our own 
viewpoint or beliefs, our biases and expectations cause us to inadvertently 
alienate those who might need us. As a result, we ultimately influence only a 
percentage of those who need our help – those who already basically agree with 
us. Here’s how we restrict our interactions:<p>
Biased listening: We each listen to Others unconsciously, through unique and 
subjective filters (biases, triggers, assumptions, habitual neural pathways, 
memory channels), regardless of our concerted attempts to accurately hear what’s 
intended. As a result, through no fault of our own, what we think we hear is 
often an inaccurate translation of what was meant and not what the speaker 
intended. So our Communication Partner (CP) might say ABC but we actually ‘hear’ 
ABD (And yes, we often hear something quite different than what was said 
although it shows up as ‘real’. Read article on how this happens.) and our 
brains don’t tell us we’re misunderstanding.<p>
I wasn’t fully aware of the extent of this until I researched my book on how to 
hear others without bias. With the best will in the world we end up only 
accurately hearing, and thereby responding to, some percentage of the message 
our CPs intend. It’s outside of our conscious awareness. But it’s possible to 
remedy by listening with a different part of our brain. More on this later.<p class="quote">
<b>Fact #1</b>. We hear Others through our subjective biases, assumptions, triggers, 
habituated neural pathways, and beliefs, causing us to unintentionally 
misinterpret the message intended, with no knowledge that what we think we’ve 
heard is mistaken. Obviously this effects both sides of a communication (i.e. 
Speakers and Listeners).<p class="quote">
<b>Subjective expectations</b>: We enter into each conversation with expectations or 
goals (conscious or unconscious) thereby restricting or misinterpreting what’s 
been said, and often missing avenues of further exploration.<p class="quote">
<b>Fact #2</b>. Entering conversations with goals or expectations (conscious or 
unconscious) unwittingly limits the outcome and full range of possibility, and 
impedes discovery, data gathering, and creativity.<p class="quote">
<b>Restricted curiosity</b>: Curiosity is both triggered and restricted by what we 
already know, i.e. you can’t ask or be curious about something you have no 
familiarity with to begin with. Using our own goals to pose questions that are 
often biased, assumptive, leading, etc. we inadvertently reduce outcomes to the 
biases we entered the conversation with; our subjective associations, 
experiences, and internal references restrict our ability to recognize accurate 
fact patterns during data gathering or analysis.<p class="quote">
<b>Fact #3</b>: We enable Others’ excellence, and our own needs for accurate data, to 
the extent we can overcome our own unconscious biases that restrict the range 
and focus of our curiosity.<p class="quote">
<b>Cognitive dissonance</b>: When the content we share – information, ideas, advice, 
written material - goes against our CPs conscious or unconscious beliefs, we 
cause resistance regardless of the efficacy of the information. This is why 
relevant solutions in sales, marketing, coaching, implementations, doctor’s 
recommendations etc. often fall on deaf ears. We are unwittingly causing the 
very resistance we seek to avoid as we attempt to place perfectly good data into 
someone’s idiosyncratic, habituated belief system that runs different to our 
own.<p class="quote">
<b>Fact #4</b>. Information doesn’t teach Others how to change behaviors; behavior 
change must first be initiated from beliefs, which in turn initiates buy-in.<p class="quote">
<b>Systems congruence</b>: Individuals and groups think, behave, and decide from a 
habitual system of unconscious beliefs and rules, history and experience, that 
creates and maintains their status quo. We know from Systems Theory that it’s 
impossible to change only one piece of a system without effecting the whole. 
When we attempt to offer suggestions or advise that runs counter to the 
normalized system, we cause Others to risk systems congruence and internal 
disruption. Hence, resistance. <p>
Unfortunately for those of us trying to effect change in Others, it’s important 
to remember we’re outsiders: as such, we can never fully comprehend the 
ramifications of adding our new ideas or solution, especially when every group, 
every person, believes it’s functioning well and their choices are normalized 
and habituated. Just because it seems right to us doesn’t mean it’s right for 
another. Sometimes maintaining the status quo is the right thing to do for 
reasons we can&#39;t understand; sometimes change can occur only when internal 
things need to shift in ways we cannot assist with. </p>
<p>Net net, we pose questions biased by our own need to know, offer information 
and solutions that we want to be adopted/accepted, and focus on reaching a goal 
we want to reach, all of which cause resistance: without buy-in and a clear 
route to manage any fallout from the potential change that a new element would 
cause (regardless of the outsider’s belief that change is necessary), congruent 
change can’t occur.<p class="quote">
<b>Fact #5</b>: Change cannot happen until there appropriate buy-in from all elements 
that will be touched by the change and there is a defined route to manage any 
disruption the change would entail.<p>
We are indeed limiting all of our interactions to helping only those few who are 
entirely set up to change (the low hanging fruit) and failing with those who 
might need us but aren’t quite ready. </p>
<h2>INFORMATION DOESN’T FACILITATE CHANGE </h2>
<p>As influencers, we mistakenly believe that by offering ‘good’ (relevant, 
accurate, instructive, empirical) information, the Other will not only interpret 
it the way it was intended, but know how and why to use it. But our CPs can only 
hear us through subjective filters and may not recognize, or will feel 
compromised by, what we’re trying to say. Remember: Others will not considering 
changing in ways that challenge their status quo. <p>
We can, however, shift from having the answers to helping others achieve their 
own type of excellence (regardless of whether or not it shows up looking like we 
envisioned). In other words, we can help our CPs change themselves. Indeed, by 
thinking we have the answers, by driving our own outcomes, we lose the 
opportunity to serve, enable real change, and make a difference. </p>
<p>Don’t take the need to maintain the status quo lightly. Even patients who 
sign up for prevention programs have a history of non-compliance: with new food 
plans, or recommendations of exercise programs that challenge the behaviors they 
have habituated and normalized (for good or bad), they don’t know how to remain 
congruent if they were to change. (Note: as long as healthcare professionals 
continue to push behavior change rather than facilitate belief change first, 
non-compliance will continue.) </p>
<p>It’s possible to facilitate the journey through our CPs own hierarchy of 
values and rules, enable buy-in and agreeable change, and avoid resistance – but 
not by using conventional information gathering/sharing, or listening practices 
as they all entail bias that will touch only those with the same biases. </p>
<p>To enable expanded and managed choice and to avoid resistance, we must first 
help Others recognize how to congruently change their own status quo. They may 
have buy-in issues or resource issues; maybe their hierarchy of values or goals 
would need to shift, or their rules. By focusing on facilitating choice/change 
first we can teach Others to achieve their own congruent change and then tailor 
our solutions and presentations to fit. Otherwise, our great content will only 
connect with those folks who already mirror the incoming data and overlook those 
who might have been able to change if they had known how to do so congruently.
</p>
<h2>THE SKILLS OF CHANGE </h2>
<p>I’ve developed a generic Change Facilitation model, often used in sales 
(Buying Facilitation®) and coaching, that offers the ability to facilitate 
change at the core of where our status quo originates – our internal, 
idiosyncratic, and habituated rules and beliefs. Developed over 50 years, I’ve 
coded my own Asperger’s systemizing brain, refitted some of the constructs of 
NLP, coded the system and sequence of change, and applied some of the research 
in brain sciences to determine where, if, and how new choices fit. </p>
<p>Using it, Others can consciously self-cue – normally an unconscious process – 
to enable them to discover their own needs for change in the area I can serve, 
and in a way that’s congruent with the rules and beliefs that keep their status 
quo in place. I&#39;ve trained the model globally over the past 30 years in sales, 
negotiation, marketing, patient relationships, leadership, coaching, etc. Below 
I introduce the main skills I’ve developed to enable change and choice – for me, 
the real kindness and integrity we have to offer. It’s possible to lead Others 
through<ul>
	<li>an examination of their unconscious beliefs and established systems</li>
	<li>to discover blocks, incongruences, and endemic obstructions</li>
	<li>to examine how, if, why, when they might need to change, and then</li>
	<li>help them set up the steps and means (tactically) to make those changes</li>
	<li>in a way that avoids system’s dysfunction</li>
	<li>with buy-in, consensus, and no resistance.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
For those interested in learning more, I’m happy to chat, train, and share. Or 
feel free to use my thoughts to inspire your own model.<p>
Listening for Systems: from birth we’re taught to carefully listen for content 
and try to understand the Other’s meaning (exemplified by Active Listening) 
which, because of our listening filters, often misses the underlying, unspoken 
Metamessage the speaker intends. By teaching the brain to disassociate and 
listen broadly rather than specifically, Systems Listening enables hearing the 
intended message at the root of the message being sent and supersedes all bias 
on either end. For those interested, read my article on how our listening 
restricts our worlds. </p>
<p>Facilitative Questions: conventional questions, used to gather data, are 
biased by the Speaker and interpreted in a biased way by the Responder. The 
intent of Facilitative Questions (FQ) is to lead listeners through a sequential 
discovery process through their own (often unconscious) status quo; not 
information focused and not biased, they are directive, and enable our CPs to 
discover for themselves the full range of elements they must address to achieve 
excellence. Here is a simple (out of sequence) example of the differences 
between conventional questions and FQs. Note how the FQ teaches the Other how to 
think:<ol>
		<li>Conventional Question: Why do you wear your hair like that? This question, 
meant to extract data for the Speaker’s use, is biased by the Speaker and limits 
choices within the Responder. Bias/Bias</li>
		<li>Facilitative Question: How would you know if it were time to reconsider your 
hairstyle? While conventional questions ask/pull biased data, this question 
sequentially leads the Other through focused scans of unconscious beliefs in the 
status quo. Formulating them requires Listening for Systems.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
Using specific words, in a specific order, to stimulate specific thought 
categories, FQs lead Others down their steps of congruent change, with no bias. 
Now we can be part of the process with them much earlier and use our desire to 
influence change to positive effect. We can actually help Others help 
themselves. </p>
<p><b>Steps of change</b>: There is a habituated, idiosyncratic hierarchy of people, 
rules, values, systems, and history within each status quo. By helping our CPs 
navigate down their hierarchy they can discover and manage each point necessary 
to change without disruption or resistance. Until they know how to do this – and 
note, as outsiders we can NEVER understand this - they can take no action as 
their habitual functioning (their status quo) is at risk. Offering them our 
information is the final thing they’ll need when all of the change elements are 
recognized. </p>
<p>To me, being kind, ethical and true servants, being influencers who can make 
a difference, means helping Others be all they can be THEIR way, not OUR way. As 
true servant leaders and change agents we can facilitate real, lasting change 
and then, when Others know how to change congruently, our important solutions 
will be heard.</p>
