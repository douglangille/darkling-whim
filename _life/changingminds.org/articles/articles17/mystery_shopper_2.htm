<p>To mystery shop a company means to call then as if you are looking to buy 
what they're selling and gather data on how they present themselves to the 
prospective customer. We have made mystery shopping a staple of Gold Star's 
overall sales strategy. </p>
<p>All new originators are assigned to mystery shop during their first days on 
the job. They develop a specific scenario and call a number of companies. For 
example, they introduce themselves as a first-time buyer relocating to that 
particular city, seeking a $250,000 mortgage, putting 10 percent down and 
expecting to close the loan in 28 days. Then they listen carefully to the 
lender's responses, offer a few objections, evaluate each call's strengths and 
weaknesses, and use the appropriate information to prepare their own 'talking 
points' script. </p>
<p>From our experience, the responding salespeople generally 
can be described in one of three categories: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Extremely knowledgeable and helpful. They listen to the 
	mystery shopper's questions, inquire about their current 
	situation and future plans, answer objections, and appear 
	genuinely interested in providing the best possible solution. </li>
	<li>Somewhat knowledgeable, not quite as attentive. These 
	salespeople focus more attention on their latest products and 
	spend less time discussing customer needs. At least they 
	appear interested and answer most of your questions. </li>
	<li>Inept and abrupt. They are not nearly as knowledgeable as 
	their counterparts. They sound rushed, not able or willing to 
	answer customers' questions in detail. These salespeople are 
	often overly aggressive in getting you to commit without 
	having all of the appropriate information. They are the type 
	customers generally prefer to avoid. </li>
</ul>
<p>Mystery shopping can be helpful not only to learn more about your 
competitors, but also to refine your own sales strategies. Take the strengths 
from the responding salespeople and develop them into your strategy and turn 
their weaknesses into your successes. </p>
