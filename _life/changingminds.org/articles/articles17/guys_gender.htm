Guys Aren&#39;t Gender Neutral: the how and why of (un)biased communication</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
As someone who&#39;s written about communication for decades, I&#39;ve decided to say 
what it feels like day in, day out, to be at the wrong end of being a person in 
America. A female. This article offers my personal viewpoint of how our endemic 
gender communication biases affect me as a woman. I hope it will inspire a 
dialogue that leads to gender equal communication. <p>
I don&#39;t want this article to be a &#39;scold&#39;; there&#39;s plenty of blame to go around 
given 1. our cultural norm that assumes a male preference; 2. women have been 
quiet when at the wrong end of gender communication bias (fear of reprisal, 
exhaustion and impotence from decades of being disparaged). But I deeply long 
for authentic and respectful styles of speech. <p>
I suspect most men don&#39;t understand what we women have to adjust to even in 
ordinary daily activities, from small seemingly-insignificant slights to those 
that cut to the bone; I suspect most men don&#39;t realize how the endemic male bias 
methodically picks away at our souls. I&#39;d like to think men would be willing to 
make some alternate choices where possible.<p>
In this article I&#39;ll share my personal thoughts on what it feels like, what I 
hear, when I&#39;m spoken to as &#39;less than&#39;. Some of what I&#39;m going to say will be 
obvious to some of you, some of you may not understand or identify with what I&#39;m 
saying (and men, since most of you have no history of being a woman, this might 
seem funny or slight, but I&#39;d like you to consider my truth), and some of you 
may judge me. But just maybe a few things I say will open a door to awareness so 
a dialogue can begin and start a conversation so we can heal this thing and come 
together as equals.<h2>
ACCEPTED BIAS</h2>
<p>
At an event recently, a man walked up to introduce himself. Here was our 
conversation:<p class="quote">
BILL: Oh Hi! You&#39;re the girl with two names!<p class="quote">
SDM: No. I happen to be a woman, not a child. And yes, I&#39;m the woman with two 
names.<p class="quote">
BILL: Aw, come on!!! Gimme a break! Get off it, will ya?<p class="quote">
SDM: Seriously? You&#39;re going to defend that? Surely by now you&#39;ve been educated 
by women in your life as to the proper way to refer to an adult female.<p class="quote">
BILL: I&#39;ve been educated!!! Believe me! A lot! I know what I&#39;m supposed to do! 
Very well!<p class="quote">
SDM: So what&#39;s stopping you from doing it?<p class="quote">
Bill went quiet. We stood quietly looking at each other. He then said, in a very 
soft voice:<p class="quote">
BILL: You&#39;re right. It&#39;s an old habit, and I&#39;m embarrassed I spoke without 
thinking. I mean no disrespect. I do realize you&#39;re an adult. I&#39;ll work harder 
at it. Thanks for reminding me. <p>
Why did he have to fight so hard to be wrong? Why was it easier to try to 
diminish me rather than apologize?<p>
Let me begin with the very easiest question and annoyance: Why can&#39;t men tell 
the difference between a child and an adult? It&#39;s a no-brainer: There are two 
categories of people - child people and adult people. Children are boys and 
girls. Adults are men and women. Simple. It&#39;s a respect thing. I suspect most 
men over 25 wouldn&#39;t be happy constantly, daily, referred to as boys/children.
<h2>
WHAT&#39;S IN A WORD?</h2>
<p>
Just curious: if you refer to a grown female adult as a &#39;girl&#39;, what do you call 
an eleven year old female child? A 7 year old? Um… girl… girl, girl? Do we women 
really have to fight for the right to be referred to as adults? It&#39;s not a small 
thing: it sets the tone of the underlying thinking. And yet it has persisted for 
eons. In line for a movie once in 1980, I heard one man tell another: &#39;When a 
woman hears the word &#39;girl&#39; she doesn&#39;t hear the rest of the sentence.&#39; Almost 
40 years ago, yet the problem remains. And as a woman facing so many other 
slights, when you refer to me as a child, my rights, my intelligence, my 
sexuality, my power is diminished.<p>
Another problem frequently ignored is the cultural acceptance of conforming to a 
male bias – male being seen as &#39;neutral&#39;. Why is &#39;guys&#39; the &#39;gender neutral&#39; 
term? Why not have everyone be &#39;gals&#39;? Sounds funny right? Why? Why not use 
Folks (more inclusive) as the gender neutral term? Every time – every time – I 
am amongst women and someone calls us &#39;guys&#39;, I look around to see where the men 
are and wonder why I&#39;m being excluded. What about &#39;all men are created equal&#39;? 
or &#39;manpower&#39; and &#39;mankind&#39;? Accepted as gender neutral, but &#39;feminism&#39; (which 
is defined as &#39;equality between the sexes&#39;) is a term to be avoided because it&#39;s 
&#39;about women&#39;?<p>
And how did wearing pants become gender neutral? Generally, men don&#39;t have an 
option to wear skirts – i.e. if conforming company attire for, say, McDonalds or 
the USPO, would be that everyone wore skirts? See what I mean? The assumption 
that &#39;male&#39; equals gender neutral stops us from creatively discovering something 
new that&#39;s both/and.<p>
What about pronouns in books. Why are they almost always male? Do men realize 
what it&#39;s like to read only masculine pronouns in books, newspapers, articles. 
Every time I pick up something to read – every time - I have to adjust. Dammit! 
I&#39;m not a HE, or isn&#39;t this book for me? In my own books I alternate pronouns 
between odd and even chapters. A reader once wrote me to ask why all (ALL) the 
pronouns in the entire book were female. &#39;Such a good book otherwise,&#39; he wrote. 
&#39;Very annoying.&#39; He was so annoyed by half the chapters with &#39;she&#39; that he 
didn&#39;t even notice that the other half were &#39;he&#39;. And yes, we refer to doctors 
and other professionals as &#39;he&#39; although law schools, medical schools, etc. enroll 51% women. <p>
This presumption that male is preferred overlooks women of every profession. 
It&#39;s been proven in books, scientific research, for decades that women managers 
provide better results; women directors, artists, consultants, negotiators, 
bring an emotional honesty and innovation that doesn&#39;t exist with men. And the 
patients of women doctors get healthy more quickly with fewer relapses. Why is 
this still a thing?<p>
What is it that makes someone with a penis automatically better, smarter, more 
trustworthy, more creative or worth more money? Don&#39;t even get me started on why 
having a vagina means we don&#39;t like getting paid for our work, or look forward 
to unwanted sexual advances from colleagues and bosses. <h2>
TO SAY OR NOT TO SAY</h2>
<p>
From my earliest memory – certainly in the decades I&#39;ve been an adult – I&#39;ve had 
to find ways to manage the disrespect, the condescension, the belittlement, I 
often feel from men when in conversation. Should I shut my mouth and stay silent 
(the route most women take given it&#39;s such a frequent occurrence), express my 
annoyance, or turn off my feelings so the disrespect doesn&#39;t get to me? Do I say 
something in the hopes that it will make a difference - that the dolt speaking 
to me might not do it to the next woman – and risk being put down? My self-talk 
sounds like this: &#39;Idiot. Does he realize he just insulted me? Is he mean? or 
just stupid? Is he worthy of my energy to share my feelings and maybe teach him 
something or if I do, will he recognize what he&#39;s done? or be a jerk and put me 
down?&#39; Until now, I&#39;ve walked away and ended our connection. <p>
It&#39;s a sad commentary that the baseline, endemic assumption is that women will 
bend to a man. And if she doesn&#39;t like it and – men aren&#39;t used to women who 
speak up – says something about it, she gets shunned, made fun of, tattled on, 
put down, beaten, berated, excluded, called a nasty name; men prefer to defend 
their actions rather than think they might have harmed someone, or be wrong. But 
I&#39;m done with making excuses for men. If someone hurts my feelings or offends 
me, I will now say something. Silence has been our enemy. I am silent no more.<p>
I think the tide may be shifting. Women are speaking up now and many men are 
listening. But the male bias is deeply, deeply built in to our culture, 
relationships, child care (How many men know their kids&#39; shoe size? Their kid&#39;s 
upcoming school trips?), our work lives. Here&#39;s an exemplary story: While hiking 
in Bend last summer I came upon a family who had stopped to look at the view. On 
the right stood a woman, two teenage daughters, and a dog. About 15 feet away 
was the man. The woman stopped me and asked if I&#39;d take a picture of the family. 
Sure. At which point this conversation ensued:<p class="quote">
MAN turning to his family members: Hey, why don&#39;t you all come over here?<p class="quote">
SDM at the point in my life when I say what I want: You&#39;re entire family is over 
there. Why don&#39;t you just move yourself over to them? Why should they all move 
over to you?<p class="quote">
DAUGHTER: Right on, sister.<p class="quote">
MAN in utter confusion, seriously: What??<p class="quote">
WIFE: I&#39;ll explain it to you later, Joe. Ma&#39;am, he has a hard time when he&#39;s not 
the center of everything. And after all these years we&#39;ve been married, and all 
the conversations with the women in his life, I have no idea why he still thinks 
he is. Men are just a different species.<p>
They&#39;ve had that conversation many times, and yet there it is still. The 
expectation, beyond all logic, that an entire family – and dog! - would move 15 
feet because the person &#39;over there&#39; was male. <p>
How sad that so much creativity is lost, so many relationships damaged, so many 
works of art and innovations and services that never get created; so much 
possibility of learning and growing and caring and supporting each other through 
this maze of life because of our culturally ingrained assent that all things 
male are the standardized choice.<h2>
WHAT DOES RESPECTFUL COMMUNICATION SOUND LIKE?</h2>
<p>
For those of you who may not be aware of some of the things that might make the 
women in your life feel less-than, I will share some of the comments and 
questions I regularly hear. And note: I lived in Europe for six years where men 
spoke to me with egalitarian, respectful, authentic communication. I was shocked 
on return at the level of condescension, the use of words of mistrust, 
skepticism and degradation that&#39;s built into – and accepted! - our daily 
communication. Even now, as a well-known, well-respected author of several 
bestsellers, inventor, entrepreneur, etc. my intelligence and ability are 
regularly questioned. Here are a smattering of phrases I hear regularly:<p class="quote">
<i>Do you really think you can do that? or Don&#39;t you think you need help with that? 
or Are you sure you don&#39;t need help? * Did you do it yourself? * That dress 
really makes you look sexy.* Just scroll down and hit &#39;enter&#39; – it&#39;s right there 
in front of you.* That&#39;s pretty good – did you come up with that yourself? * 
Calling you a girl is a complement – chill out! * You don&#39;t like me calling you 
Dear – what&#39;s your problem? * You took it the wrong way; get over it.* Here you 
go, young lady (Spoken by much younger man: my response is always &#39;I&#39;m neither.&#39; 
I&#39;m not young, and who the hell wants to be a lady?) * We didn&#39;t forget you – we 
just thought you might not be interested in that sort of thing and we knew John 
could catch you up. You don&#39;t mind, right? * Oh! You know about 
boats/math/science/computers… etc.! Huh! * Seriously? You can do that? – and 
what is your background? * You write books? Do you write them on your own, or do 
you have a ghost writer? * Where are your footnotes…what do you mean &#39;original 
thinking&#39; – that&#39;s impossible.* It&#39;s all in your head. * You won&#39;t go out with 
me??? Dyke. * You look a bit tired; do you need a break? * I hope you don&#39;t mind 
that I used your term – I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t mind if there&#39;s no attribution. * I 
know you think your way works, but let&#39;s use the conventional format, shall we?</i><p>
Women live with this daily. There&#39;s this all pervasive, underlying, endemic 
assumption that we&#39;re not to be believed, trusted, or acknowledged, that we 
don&#39;t know/can&#39;t know, or that we won&#39;t care if we&#39;re left out, ignored, made 
small, or paid less. Why is it still a thing to pay women less? Why? <p>
There hasn&#39;t been a day in my life that I haven&#39;t had at least one conversation 
that would never have occurred if I were a man. The language is different, the 
tone might be snide or pejorative, the assumptions patronizing even if the men 
mean well. One man actually went out of his way recently to send me an email re 
an article I wrote on some of my original thinking: &#39;Well, you&#39;re just full of 
yourself, now, aren&#39;t you!&#39; He actually wrote that – and went out of his way to 
send it to me! My answer, of course, was &#39;Yup.&#39; I doubt he would have sent that 
note to a man. He might have thought it, but wouldn&#39;t have sent it. Does 
possessing a vagina mean that I don&#39;t mind being insulted?<h2>
COMMUNICATION</h2>
<p>
For too long our tribal norms have normalized condescension and sexuality: 
assumptions of inequality has been built into our culture. I believe men aren&#39;t 
speaking this way purposefully, and the majority of men trust and respect women. 
But it&#39;s time to change the language to reflect this. Let&#39;s start with how 
conversations should sound and what we should aspire to:<ol>
	<li>A collaborative communication – what I call a WE Space – between both 
Communication Partners (CPs) that has no leader, no follower. Both/And. No right 
or wrong, better or worse, smarter or dumber. Both and neither partner are in 
control. Everyone is equal. No put-downs or slights. Every exchange includes the 
feelings of the Other. A Recognition and openness to emerging ideas, feelings, 
problems without defense should something need resolving. No fault – just 
willingness to get it right for both CPs. Everyone enters the conversation with 
no goal other than to be collaborative and serve the other. And if something 
specific needs to emerge from the conversation, it must be agreed to by all 
parties at the beginning of the conversation. [NOTE: I teach this in 
corporations. It&#39;s astounding how many men, even CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, 
aren&#39;t aware of their communication biases.]</li>
	<li>Listening biases that assume a positive outcome, not an assumed conflict that 
starts with an ear readied to be &#39;right&#39; if challenged by a woman. Men: women 
very often feel conversations include words and attitudes that make us wrong, 
weak, or silly, giving men permission to step in with disparaging demeanor, 
words, insults, and be &#39;right&#39;. It&#39;s inherent in language and attitude choices 
and often not obvious to you. It&#39;s all been normalized – but we women always, 
always notice.</li>
	<li>The belief that everyone is equal, that everyone&#39;s ideas are valid, that 
everyone&#39;s work is meaningful, that people are generally honest. </li>
	<li>The time between exchanges to notice a shift in voice, tone, tempo, volume 
that might connote a problem that creates a pulling away from engagement.</li>
	<li>The ability to check yourself if thoughts of intelligence, sexuality, 
competition arise.</li>
	<li>The willingness to ask if there&#39;s a problem, or apologize when necessary.</li>
	<li>The willingness to not get your individual needs met if the conversation 
takes a different turn than expected.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
I believe that behaviors are merely a translation of our beliefs. Since our 
language is one form of behaving, I&#39;d like to pose a few questions to men to 
help begin considering change:<ul>
		<li>What would you need to believe differently to be willing to examine your own 
unconscious attitudes in case you might be harboring some imbalances? How will 
you know (given your normalized and habituated communication) there&#39;s a problem?</li>
		<li>In case your internal exploration shows no problems, would you be willing to 
request feedback from 3 women as per your communication patterns?</li>
		<li>What would collaborative, respectful conversations sound like? And what, 
specifically, might you need to change to achieve this? </li>
		</ul>
		<p>
Play with listening filters. Using these 5 words – Why Did You Do That – 
&#39;listen&#39; to them in your head as if they were said by 1. A close female – wife, 
partner; 2. A female colleague; 3. Your mother; 4. A male colleague; 5. Your 
father. What are the differences in tone, expectation, assumed meaning, feeling? 
If you notice any, write them down. [NOTE: in my book What? Did you really say 
what I think I heard? I have many fun exercises to highlight listening biases 
and assumptions.]<p>
Thinking about entering conversations with women:<ol>
			<li>What are your expectations re your own takeaways going in to the 
call/conversation? Expectations such as being collaborative, or getting your own 
objectives met, etc. Write them down.</li>
			<li>Listen for shifts in a colleague&#39;s speech patterns. When a shift occurs 
following something you&#39;ve said, stop the conversation and ask your 
Communication Partner if something happened, and if there was something you 
inadvertently said that needs to be examined.</li>
			<li>Go into a Starbucks, or other coffee shop, and overhear a few conversations 
that you can hear well enough to mentally code. Notice the flow, the words, the 
tone; notice when shifts occur in topics. See if you can tell if there were 
shifts that might have been initiated by male-dominated biases built in. Listen 
to conversations between women only, men only. And mixed. What are the 
differences between types of words used, underlying and unspoken messages, 
between the three.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
Here are some easy phrases to use:<p class="quote">
<i>That dress is pretty. It suits you.</i><p class="quote">
<i>I am so excited to learn you know how to do that! I&#39;d love to learn how at some 
point.</i><p class="quote">
<i>Your ideas are so profound! Well done! I&#39;d love to hear more. Given some of my 
ideas are more traditional, I&#39;d like to ask some questions so I can add to what 
I already know.</i><p class="quote">
<i>Oh my! I hadn&#39;t meant to speak in a way that you find patronizing. I apologize. 
Would you mind telling me exactly what it was you heard and tell me how I can 
say it differently so I can learn to not do it again? Thanks.</i><p class="quote">
<i>Seems you&#39;re not able to get X up on your computer. There should be a &#39;submit&#39; 
button near the bottom somewhere. It might be hidden on your screen. It&#39;s up 
there somewhere I think. </i> <p>
My bias is that we communicate kindly and respectfully, that women get treated 
like capable, creative humans, that men are merely the other gender – not better 
or worse, smarter or dumber. I believe we&#39;re all here to serve each other, life 
being what it is. Let&#39;s not use our gender to separate us. And men, if you&#39;re 
not sure what to say, here&#39;s the rule: they only barometer for acceptable is 
integrity. <p>
