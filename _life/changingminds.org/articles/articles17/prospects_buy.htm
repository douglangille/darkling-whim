Sell to Prospects who CAN/WILL Buy</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Your solution is great. You know the narrative of the type of buyers who buy. 
You’re writing appropriate content and getting it out to the right demographic. 
But you’re still closing less than 5% from first contact and spending a ton of 
resource finding different ways to touch the same people as your competition 
touches – in hopes that you’ll have the right message that catches them at the 
right time, or just grind them down. <p>
Why aren’t more buyers buying? Do you know why your well-executed sales outreach 
programs – salesperson, social media, digital media, marketing - don’t elicit 
more closed sales? <h2>
DO YOU WANT TO SELL? OR HAVE SOMEONE BUY?</h2>
<p>
You’re not closing more because you’re messages target a restricted audience, 
those who have already 
<ul>
	<li>tried all familiar resources and workarounds to fix their own problem and came 
up short,</li>
	<li>decided their only route to a problem resolution is to make a purchase,
	</li>
	<li>gotten appropriate buy-in and managed any disruption that a purchase would 
bring </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
and then you and your competitors work tirelessly to grab from that small pool 
of ready buyers. Seeking those you believe are probable buyers (those who SHOULD 
buy) limits your spectrum of buyers to those at the end of their decision path 
(beginning at step 10 of 13 steps. See steps below.) and concluded they not only 
need to buy something, but are prepared for any change a purchase will cause.
<p>
We forget that a buying decision is primarily a change management problem, not a 
solution choice issue (Indeed, the last thing buyers want is to buy anything. 
Literally: the last thing.). By acting as if selling causes buying, we disregard 
the internal, private, idiosyncratic, systemic change management work buyers 
must do before they’ve got their ducks in a row and are ready; until then, they 
can’t buy regardless of their need or the efficacy of your solution.<p>
The sales model only handles the solution choice/buying portion of the complete 
Buying Decision Path targeting those you believe have a probable ‘need’ - the 
low hanging fruit – and have completed their journey to Buyer Readiness. But 
this is merely a fraction of those who will eventually buy.<p>
Here are the problems you face when targeting probably buyers who don’t yet have 
all their ducks in a row:<ul>
		<li>Once prospects have determined a need, you’re already in a competitive 
situation and have to find ways to be better/cheaper/more branded.</li>
		<li>You’re wasting over 90% of your time finding, following up, meeting with, and 
in several ways trying to connect with, those who appear to need your solution 
but turn out not to be buyers.</li>
		<li>You ignore the high percentage of those who would/will buy but aren’t yet 
ready to (but could easily be gotten ready).</li>
		<li>You overlook the possibility of connecting with, and serving, real buyers 
early along their change management/decision path</li>
		<li>and reduces the number of possible entry points onto the Buying Decision 
Team/buying decision.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
Sure, you’re making great information available for those who know what to look 
for and are ready to engage. But by adding a new component, you could be 
entering earlier and facilitating the full range of steps along the buying 
decision process - those that are not acessible with the sales model. The 
problem has never been your terrific solution but in closing all the sales you 
deserve to close. It’s because sales is solution-placement driven, seeking 
optimal ways to get to probable buyers but ignores the much higher pool of real 
prospects who aren’t far enough down their buyer’s journey to commit or engage.<h2>
SELLING DOESN’T CAUSE BUYING</h2>
		<p>
As a solution placement model, the sales model is great for when buyers have 
determined they cannot resolve their solution on their own and have gotten the 
appropriate buy in for change. But for those buyers who SHOULD buy but haven’t 
yet determined if they CAN buy, sales doesn’t have the intent, skills, or focus 
on facilitating the Systems Congruence steps buyers must take first. Sales 
wasn’t created to do that.<p>
The ‘modern’ sales model was developed by Dale Carnegie, introduced in his book 
How to Win Friends and Influence People (1937). He promoted relationships, 
face-to-face visits, finding folks with a need, and developing great pitches. 
Think about it: while there are certainly a helluva lot more bells and whistles 
in 2017, the basic skeleton of need/relationship/appointment/pitch, remains the 
same. It shouldn’t be. The buying environment has changed dramatically over the 
past 100 or so years, far more complex than merely choosing a vendor or 
solution; the sales model hasn’t. It’s time for new thinking. Let’s join buyers 
where they really have their real ‘pain’ and facilitate Buyer Readiness earlier 
in their buy-in/systemic change process. <p>
If prospective buyers might need a new CRM system, for example, they cannot buy 
until their tech guys, users, time frames, vendor relationships, current 
software etc. are in agreement, recognize they can’t fix their problem 
themselves, and have assembled everyone who will touch the final solution to 
integrate the ‘new’. It’s not merely about the need; making a purchase means 
change and until all ‘givens’ are known and handled, the cost of a purchase is 
too high and they’ll maintain their status quo. And the time it takes them to 
manage all this is the length of the sales cycle. Having some good conversations 
with your sales guy, reading some good articles, and liking/needing your 
solution are necessary later, once they’ve finished their Pre-Sales change work.
<p>
The early portion of the decision path is based on managing internal shifts in 
the status quo, existent rules, internal politics, and relationships, and is 
decidedly not concerned with buying anything; the sales model is not the 
appropriate tool for this. Buyers don’t want to buy anything. They just want to 
resolve a problem with the least disruption and the most efficient use of 
resource.<p>
All prospects/buyers must do this anyway, with you or without you. It might as 
well be with you. It’s what they’re doing (inefficiently, and in confusion) as 
you sit and wait and hope they’ll call and buy. Why not use your industry 
knowledge to help them figure out how to traverse their steps efficiently? With 
a different hat on and a new skill set, you can facilitate them quickly through 
their process and be right there with them as they decide. You want to seek/find 
those exact ones who CAN/WILL buy. <h2>
STAGES IN THE BUYING DECISION PATH</h2>
		<p>
To design messaging to find buyers earlier in their Buying Decision Path, 
recognize the steps buyers take to be ready and able to purchase:<ol>
			<li>Idea stage: Is there a problem?<p>a. Does it need to be solved? When? How?<p>b. What&#39;s the fallout?<p>c. Is the cost of a fix lower than the cost of the status quo?<p>d. Who needs to be involved? 
			</li>
			<li>Brainstorming stage: Idea discussed with colleagues.</li>
			<li>Initial discussion stage: Colleagues discuss the problem, posit who to 
include on Buying Decision Team, consider possible fixes and fallout. Action 
groups formed. Research begins. New team members invited.</li>
			<li>Contemplation stage: Group discusses:<p>a. Known resources to fix the problem (workarounds) and acceptable/fallout from 
each;<p>b. People who would need to buy-in.</li>
			<li>Organization stage: Group collects all internal issues that need 
consideration, including finding more folks to invite into process; research 
into the elements of the status quo; fallout to change. Begins to assess the 
entire scope of problem, resolution possibilities, cost of change/no change.</li>
			<li>Change management stage: Group to determine:<p>a. Types of research necessary (and who will do it),<p>b. If all appropriate people are involved (and who else to invite),<p>c. A review of all elements of the problem and solution options,<p>d. How much disruption and change management would be required,<p>e. The pros/cons/possibilities of external solutions vs current vendor vs 
workaround.</li>
			<li>Coordination stage:<p>a. Review needs, ideas, issues of new members invited aboard and how their 
voices affect choices, goals, and implementation problems; 
			<p>b. Incorporate change considerations; 
			<p>c. Delineate everyone’s thoughts re goals and change capacity;<p>d. Appropriate research responsibilities.</li>
			<li>Research stage: Specific research for each possible solution; seek answers to 
how fallout and change would need to be managed with each solution.</li>
			<li>Consensus stage: Buying Decision Team meets to share research consider their 
givens: downsides per type of solution, possibilities, outcomes, problems, 
management considerations, changes in policy, job description changes, HR 
issues, etc. General decisions made. Buy-in and consensus necessary.</li>
			<li>Action stage: Responsibilities apportioned to manage the specifics of Stage 
9. Calls made to several vendors for interviews and data gathering.</li>
			<li>Second brainstorming stage: Discussion on results of data gathering, calls 
with vendors and partners, and fallout/benefits of each. Favored vendors pitched 
by team members.</li>
			<li>Choice stage: New solution agreed on. Change management issues delineated 
and put in place. Leadership initiatives prepared to avoid disruption.</li>
			<li>Implementation stage: Vendor contacted. Purchase made. Everything put in 
place.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>For those who want to explore these stages and all elements of how buyers buy, 
see my book Dirty Little Secrets: why buyers can’t buy and sellers can’t sell 
and what you can do about it (www. Dirtylittlesecretsbook.com).</p>
			<h2>
A NEED ISN’T ENOUGH</h2>
			<p>
Instead of only targeting probable buyers and ignoring the much larger pool of 
real buyers who are merely too early in their decision process to consider 
buying anything (but will, once they get to that point in their process), add a 
new target market and new messaging: Code the off-line process your buyers 
traverse, and use your new messaging to help the right ones get ready. Note: you 
can’t use your current messaging as that’s the wrong tool for this because it’s 
not information, need, solution, or sales driven. You need a new skill to 
facilitate change. To manage this Pre-Sales work, and as an adjunct to the sales 
model, I’ve developed Buying Facilitation® to<ul>
				<li>work with sales to enter the Buying Decision Path between Steps 1-9 above 
(Pre-Sales),</li>
				<li>seek/find those who CAN buy (those who’ve recognized a problem in the area 
your solution serves, but aren’t set up to buy anything yet), </li>
				<li>find the large pool of real buyers who can be facilitated efficiently through 
to Buyer Readiness,</li>
				<li>collapse the time from problem recognition to discovery of need to purchase,</li>
				<li>enable sellers to be servant leaders and real consultants, and be part of the 
Buying Decision Team when buyers get to the point they’re ready to buy.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
Buying Facilitation® is a generic change management, decision facilitation model 
that can help buyers traverse that part of their journey that sales doesn’t 
handle. Using unique skill sets not involved in sales (Facilitative Questions, 
Listening for Systems, change sequencing) it was designed to optimize the 
change/decision process. By adding some new messaging and Buyer Persona targets, 
you can find those who aren’t touched by your sales messages but are in the 
process of becoming buyers.<p>
By adding new messaging to target those who CAN/WILL buy rather than those 
you’ve determine might have a ‘need’ (probable buyers), by understanding the 
Pre-Sales (change management) steps all buyers take, by including messaging that 
teaches them how to address their internal resistance areas, disparate voices 
and needs, you can facilitate the Pre-Sales decision path of those who CAN/WILL 
buy and enable them to ready themselves for a purchase – and your sales 
messaging. Here are two examples of success after learning Buying Facilitation®:<p>
Kaiser Permanente initially made 110 visits and got 18 closed sales, wasting too 
much time traveling to those who COULDN’T/WOULDN’T buy. Adding Buying 
Facilitation® to their sales, they made 27 visit and got 25 closed sales. They 
still needed to sell – but only to those who were ready/able to buy. And saved a 
ton of time/money only traveling to those who were real buyers.<p>
Working with Wachovia small business bankers, they went from 100 calls, 10 
appointments, and 2 closed sales over 11 months, to 100 calls, 37 appointments, 
and 29 closed sales in 3 months. The sales folks’ opening Facilitative Question 
taught prospects how to do an immediate ‘sort’ for change, rather than need, and 
got invited to visit and meet all (all) the team members for their first 
appointment:<p>
How are you adding new banking services to the bank you’re currently using for 
those times you need additional resource?<p>
Know all – all – of the elements (most are hidden, personal and idiosyncratic) 
of your buyer’s Pre-Sales decision/change steps so you can design messaging to 
help them traverse their steps (Note: offering information about your solution 
here is irrelevant)to change and consensus – and THEN sell. We wait while they 
do this anyway and run after the ones who have completed this journey. Why not 
add a new criteria and skill set to what you’re already doing and expand your 
focus to find those who WILL buy.<p>
