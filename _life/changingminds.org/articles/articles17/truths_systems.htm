Some Truths about Systems</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
As a Change Facilitator, I often get asked about the nature of decision making, 
change, and buy-in. Since folks are often surprised that my responses have such 
a sharp focus on systems, I thought it might be an interesting conversation to 
start among influencers. To that end, I’ve jotted down a few of my favorite 
‘laws’ of systems that might help explain my intense respect for them. Here are 
my thoughts on how and why systems are not only central to change, but the glue 
that makes the status quo so substantial.<ul>
	<li>A system is a conglomeration of elements that represent the status quo and 
have agreed to the same rules and beliefs - which which are then expressed 
through behaviors. All behaviors represent and express the beliefs and rules 
inherent in the system.</li>
	<li>A system has created its status quo, with a set identity and Hierarchy of 
Beliefs that govern and label it. It’s largely unconscious and historic, 
designed to maintain itself as is, perpetuated by the historic rules that 
recreate it daily, and defends itself at all costs. It can be said that all 
systems are complex in their own way.</li>
	<li>A system always makes choices that enable it to maintain itself with minimal 
disruption. Regardless of how others interpret the decisions or choices made by 
the system, our take-aways as Outsiders are always subjective.</li>
	<li>A system just IS. Systems always act upon the givens, rules, beliefs, etc. 
that define it, and are congruent onto itself.</li>
	<li>No one from outside the system can ever understand why it does what it does 
(i.e. behaviours) due to its idiosyncratic nature. While it may appear to 
Outsiders to be ineffective, unstable, etc, (all judgments seen through an 
Outsider’s subjective filters) it has developed operational behaviors, created 
the rules and elements of the status quo that maintains itself daily, and will 
not allow itself to be disrupted.</li>
	<li>When Outsiders attempt to push their own agendas through advice, information, 
ideas, content (i.e. sales, coaching, marketing, training, leadership, 
management) they are pushing against a closed, fixed system that must resist 
external influence in order to maintain Systems Congruence.</li>
	<li>No change can occur unless a system makes room for the new (systemic 
reorientation) in a way that maintains the rules of the system (Systems 
Congruence). </li>
	<li>All elements within a system that would be touched by a proposed change must 
agree to changing its rules, and buy-in to all of the elements that will change. 
This is the only way to ensure Systems Congruence. Otherwise there will be 
rejection, sabotage, lost relationships, misunderstanding, failed 
implementations, delayed sales cycles, etc. In other words, attempting to create 
or influence change (aimed at the behavioral level) will fail unless the system 
has already reoriented itself to seek and adopt change because it is convinced 
it cannot fix a problem itself, and has a specific path forward that is 
congruent and avoids disruption.</li>
	<li>All decisions are change management problems. Decisions are prompted by 
changes in the Hierarchy of Beliefs, and get made only when there is internal 
alignment to ensure continued congruency. </li>
	<li>To influence change, decision making, and buy-in, influencers should focus on 
the origination points (in beliefs) that designed the behaviors to begin with.
	</li>
	<li>Successful change can occur only when the system has assembled, and gotten 
buy-in from, all of the elements in the status quo that would be modified as a 
result.</li>
	<li>Before change can happen, there must be a systemic understanding of the 
downside of change, and it must be compensated for congruently. </li>
	<li>Before change can happen, the system must know with certainty that it cannot 
fix a problem on its own. The last thing a system wants is to accept an external 
fix, or change. </li>
	<li>Information does not teach a system why, when, if, or how to change. 
Information is necessary only to fill in the necessary gaps when the system gets 
to the point when it recognizes it cannot fix itself, has gotten the go-ahead 
(buy-in) from each of the affected elements and knows how to remain congruent 
while doing something differently.</li>
	<li>Before change can happen, systems must figure out how to re-organize, 
re-prioritize, enhance, or devalue, the elements that define so it continually 
maintains Systems Congruence.</li>
	<li>There are 13 steps included in all change decisions, regardless of whether 
it’s one person buying a toothbrush, or a global team deciding to implement new 
software. The steps may be iterative or unconscious, but they all must be 
addressed for congruent change to occur and for the components to design, buy-in 
to, and support, the change.</li>
	<li>All change must be initiated, and adopted, at the belief level. When content 
or influencing procedures are used to drive change, it’s too often aimed at 
changing behaviors, causing systemic resistance. </li>
	<li>Influencers can use their positions as Servant Leaders to enable people, teams 
(i.e. human systems) to traverse their own unconscious steps to change, so long 
as they avoid biased questions, biased listening, or content sharing, etc. and 
stick to facilitating the system through their own discovery and down their own 
steps to congruent change. Then it will be obvious the type of information 
required to enable change that’s non-disruptive.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>
WRAP UP</h2>
	<p>
Systems are the core - the foundation, the status quo - of congruent human 
structures (people, teams, companies, families) and are based on everything 
involved agreeing to the same rules and beliefs that specify the operating rules 
for behaviors. (It’s obvious. Do you think IBM and Google and Uber all operate 
out of the same foundational rules and operational beliefs?).<p>
This system gets up every day and replicates itself so it not only creates the 
status quo, but maintains it. All systems resist, and potentially misinterpret, 
anything from outside that threatens it. Until or unless there is a systemic 
understanding that there will be no/minimal disruption – certainly no change 
without buy-in from the elements – change will not occur.<p>
Each system (each family, each person) is unique and idiosyncratic, unknowable 
to an outsider due to its unconscious nature, history, patterns, and Hierarchy 
of Beliefs and rules.<p>
For those of us in sales, coaching, leadership, consulting, or any type of 
change management, we often use content/information (initiatives, information, 
education, pitches, marketing, advice, etc.) or our own intuition and needs for 
the Other as the means to invoke change, assuming that offering the right data, 
in the right format, will teach someone to do something differently. <p>
Yet change doesn’t happen as a result of information, regardless of how critical 
it is, unless the system has already determined its willingness and ability to 
change congruently, with buy-in from all effected elements. Change only happens 
systemically, when the foundational beliefs are ready, willing, and able to 
change. Until or unless the system learns how to facilitate and incorporate new 
congruent choices, or reprioritize the existing Hierarchy, change cannot occur.<p>
Conventional practices include posing conventional (biased) questions that 
elicit answers as per the Asker’s needs and curiosity, filtered through biased 
listening, directed toward behavior change (rather than belief change) and use 
biased content to convince/influence/rationalize the system to acquiesce. Change 
only happens when the system has already agreed, and knows how to manage any 
change so there is no disruption (or there will be automatic resistance); change 
cannot happen when the system believes it will become unstable as a result. <p>
A good rule of thumb: no one, and nothing from outside the system can change it 
so long as conventional questions and curiosity, biased content or convincer 
strategies, are used. Systems must change themselves from within. This is the 
reason why sales closes such a small percentage of prospects, why coaches have 
permanent success with so few clients, and why 97% of all implementations fail.<p>
And this is why change appears to be so hard. It’s not. We’re just going about 
it ineffectively. By merely attempting to change behaviors, we actually cause 
the resistance we get, only capture those who are ‘ready’ (the low hanging 
fruit), and miss an opportunity to facilitate and enable those who CAN change.<h2>
CHANGE FACILITATION</h2>
	<p>
I’ve developed a Change Facilitation model (Buying Facilitation®) that manages 
congruent change through a unique skill set, including Listening for Systems and 
formulating Facilitative Questions (directive and action inducing, not 
information driven or biased) that enable a system to discover its own route 
through to congruent change and its own brand of excellence. Different from 
conventional sales, coaching, etc. that run the risk of pushing change, 
facilitators enable the system to change itself, with no bias from the 
influencer, and results of greatly enhanced success.<p>
Over the last 35 years, I’ve trained the model globally to corporations and 
teams in sales (Buying Facilitation®), coaching, leadership, consulting, and 
communication (What? Did you really say what I think I heard?). It’s a generic 
model that can be used in any industry (clients include banking, consulting, 
insurance, tech, project implementations, wellness (doc/patient buy-in), real 
estate, research, travel, etc.) in any format (i.e. sales pitches, marketing 
articles, websites, questionnaires, customer service, team building, 
doctor/patient relationships, buy-in, etc.) and enables congruent buy-in and 
Change Readiness.<p>
For those ready to add a new capability to their current influencing practices, 
I’ve designed several approaches, from self-guided study, to learning programs, 
to coaching. Let me know of interest. <p>
