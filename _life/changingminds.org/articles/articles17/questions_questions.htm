Questioning Questions</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Decades ago I had an idea that questions could be vehicles to facilitate change 
in addition to eliciting answers. Convention went against me: the accepted use 
of questions (framing devices, biased by the Asker, that extract a defined range 
of answers) is built into our culture. But overlooked is their inability to 
extract good data or accurate answers due to the bias of the Asker; overlooked 
is their ability to facilitate congruent change.<h2>
WHAT IS A QUESTION?</h2>
<p>
Questions are biased by the expectations, assumptions, goals, unconscious 
beliefs and subjective experience of both the Responder and the Asker and limit 
responses accordingly. In other words, questions can’t extract ‘good’ data. 
They’re certainly not designed to lead Responders through to real change or 
accurate revelations. (What? Did you really say what I think I heard? offers a 
broad discussion of bias.) Here are the most prevalent ways we limit our 
Communication Partner’s responses:<p class="quote">
<b>Need to Know</b> Askers pose questions to pull conscious data from the Responder 
because of their own ‘need to know’, data collection, or curiosity. An example 
(Note: all following italicized questions are posed as a mythical hairdresser 
seeking business) might be: Why do you wear your hair like that?<p class="quote">
These questions risk overlooking more relevant answers that are stored beyond 
the parameters of the question posed - often in the unconscious.<p class="quote">
<b>Pull Data</b> Askers pose questions to pull a range of implicating data considered 
useful to ‘make a case’ in a ploy to obtain their desired results (i.e. sales, 
leadership, marcom, coaching). Don’t you think it might be time to get a 
haircut? <p class="quote">
These questions run a high risk of missing the full range of, or accurate, 
responses. Certainly they offer no route to enabling choice, decisions, or 
collaboration/buy-in. They encourage resistance, partial/missed answers, and 
lies. <p class="quote">
<b>Manipulate agreement/response</b> Questions that direct the Responder to find a 
specific set of responses to fit the needs and expectations of the Asker. Can 
you think of a time you’ve felt ‘cool’ when you’ve had short hair? Or Have you 
ever thought of having your hair look like Kanye/Ozzy/Justin? Or What would it 
feel like to have hair like Kanye/Ozzy/Justin? Wouldn’t you say your hairstyle 
makes you look X?<p class="quote">
These questions restrict possibility, cause resistance, create distrust, and 
encourage lying.<p class="quote">
<b>Doubt Directive</b> These questions, sometimes called ‘leading questions’ are 
designed to cause Responders to doubt their own effectiveness, in order to 
create an opening for the Asker. Do you think your hairstyle works for you?<p class="quote">
These narrow the range of possible responses, often creating some form of 
resistance or defensive lies; they certainly cause defensiveness and distrust.<p>
Questions restrict responses to the Asker’s parameters, regardless of their 
intent or the influencer’s level of professionalism and knowledge. Potentially 
important, accurate data – not to mention the real possibility of facilitating 
change - is left on the table and instead promote lost business, failure, 
distrust, bad data collection, and delayed success. Decision Scientists end up 
gathering incomplete data that creates implementation issues; leaders and 
coaches push clients toward the change they perceive is needed and often miss 
the real change needed and possible. The fields of sales and coaching are 
particularly egregious. <p>
The cost of bias and restriction is unimaginable. Here’s an especially 
unfortunate example of a well-respected research company that delayed the 
discovery of important findings due to the biases informing their research 
questions. I got a call from one of the founders of Challenger Sales to discuss 
my Buying Facilitation® model. Their research had ‘recently’ discovered that 
sales are lost/delayed/hampered due to the buyer’s behind-the-scenes change 
issues that aren’t purchase-driven and sales doesn’t address - and yay for me 
for figuring this out 35 years ago. <p>
Interesting. They figured this out now? Even David Sandler called me in 1992 
before he died to tell me he appreciated how far out of the box I went to find 
the resolution to the sales problem (He also offered to buy me out, but that’s a 
different story.). The data was always there. I uncovered this in 1983. But the 
CEB missed it because their research surveys posed biased questions that 
elicited data matching their expectations. Indeed, even during our 
conversations, my Communication Partner never got rid of his solution-placement 
(sales) biases and we never were able to find a way to partner.<h2>
WHAT IS AN ANSWER?</h2>
<p>
Used to elicit or push data, the very formulation of conventional questions 
restricts answers. If I ask ‘What did you have for breakfast?’ you cannot reply 
‘I went to the gym yesterday.’ Every answer is restricted by the biases within 
the question. I’m always disappointed when I hear sellers say “Buyers are liars” 
or coaches say “They didn’t really want to change.” Or therapists or managers or 
leaders say “They’re resisting”. Askers cause the answers they get.<ol>
	<li>Because we enter conversations with an agenda, intuition, directive, etc., 
the answers we receive are partial at best, inaccurate at worst, and potentially 
cause resistance, sabotage, and disregard.</li>
	<li>There are unknown facts, feelings, historic data, goals, etc. that lie within 
the Responder’s unconscious that hold real answers and cannot be found using 
merely the curiosity of the Asker.</li>
	<li>By approaching situations with bias, Askers can only successfully connect 
with those whose conscious biases align with their own, leaving behind many who 
could change, or connect when their unconscious data is recognized. And 
conventional questions cannot get to the unconscious. </li>
	<li>Because influencers are unaware of how their particular bias restricts an 
answer, they have no concept if there are different answers possible, and often 
move forward with bad data.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
So why does it matter if we’re biasing our questions? It matters because we are 
missing accurate results; it matters because our questions instil resistance; 
it matters because we&#39;re missing opportunities to serve and support change.<p>
When sellers ask leading questions to manipulate prospects, or coaches ask 
influencing questions to generate action, we’re coaxing our Communication 
Partner in a direction that, as we now recognize, is often biased. Imagine if we 
could reconfigure questions to elicit accurate data for researchers or marcom 
folks; or enable buyers to take quick action from ads, cold calls or large 
purchases; or help coaching clients change behaviors congruently and quickly; or 
encourage buy-in during software implementations. I’m suggesting questions can 
facilitate real change.<h2>
WHAT IS CHANGE?</h2>
	<p>
Our brain stores data rather haphazardly in our unconscious, making it difficult 
to find what we need when we need it, and making resistance prevalent when it 
seems our Status Quo is being threatened. But over the last decades, I have 
mapped the sequence of systemic change. Following this route, I&#39;ve designed a 
way to use questions as directional devices to pull relevant data in the proper 
sequence so we can lead Responders through their own internal, congruent, change 
process and avoid resistance. Not only does this broaden the range of successful 
results, but it enables quicker decisions and buy-in – not to mentiontruly offer 
a Servant Leader, win/win communication. Let’s look at what’s keeping us wedded 
to our Status Quo and how questions can enable change.<p>
All of us are a ‘system’ of subjectivity collected during our lifetime: unique 
rules, values, habits, history, goals, experience, etc. that operates 
consensually to create and maintain our Status Quo; it resides in our 
unconscious and defines our Status Quo. Without it, we wouldn’t have criteria 
for any choices, or actions, or habits whatsoever. Our system is hard wired to 
keep us who we are (Systems Congruence). <p>
To learn something new, to do something different or learn a new behavior, to 
buy something, to take vitamins or get a divorce or use new software or be 
willing to forgive a friend, the Status Quo must buy in to change from within - 
an inside job. Information pulled or pushed – regardless of the intent, or 
relationship, or efficacy - will be resisted.<p>
For congruent change to occur – even a small one - appropriate elements within 
our Status Quo must buy into, and have prepared for, a possibly disruptive 
addition (idea, product, etc.). But since the process is internal, 
idiosyncratic, and unconscious, our biased questions cause the system to defend 
itself and we succeed only with those folks whose unconscious biases and beliefs 
mirror our own.<ol>
		<li>People hear each other through their own biases. You ask biased questions, 
receive biased answers, and hit pay dirt only when your biases match. Everyone 
else will ignore, resist, misunderstand, mishear, act out, sabotage, forget, 
ignore, etc.</li>
		<li>Due to their biased and restricting nature, your questions will not 
facilitate those who are not ready, willing, or able to manage internal change 
congruently regardless of the wisdom of your comments or their efficacy.</li>
		<li>Without the Responder being ready, willing, and able to change, ACCORDING TO 
THEIR OWN CRITERIA AND SYSTEMS RULES, they cannot buy, accept, adopt, or change 
in any way.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
To manage congruent change, align the Status Quo, and enable the steps to 
achieve buy-in - I’ve developed Facilitative Questions that work comfortably 
with conventional questions and lead Responders to<ul>
			<li>find their own answers hidden within their unconscious, </li>
			<li>retrieve complete, relevant, accurate answers at the right time, in the right 
order to </li>
			<li>traverse the sequenced steps to congruent, systemic change/excellence, while</li>
			<li>avoiding restriction and resistance and</li>
			<li>include their own values and subjective experience.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
It’s possible to help folks make internal changes and find their own brand of 
excellence.<h2>
FACILITATIVE QUESTIONS</h2>
			<p>
Facilitative Questions (FQs) employ a new skill set that is built upon systems 
thinking: listening for systems (i.e. no bias) and Servant Leadership. Even on a 
cold call or in content marketing, sellers can enable buyers down their route to 
change and buy-in; coaches can lead clients through their own unique change 
without resistance; leaders can get buy-in immediately; change implementations 
won’t get resistance; advertisers and marketers can create action.<p>
</p>
<p>Using specific words, in a very specific sequence, it’s possible to pose 
questions that are free of bias, need or manipulation and guide congruent 
change. <p>
Facilitative Question Not information gathering, pull, or manipulative, FQs are 
guiding/directional tools, like a GPS system. Like a GPS they don’t need the 
details of travel – what you’re wearing, what function you’re attending – to 
dictate two left turns. They lead Responders congruently, without any bias, from 
where they’re at to Excellence. How would you know if it were time to reconsider 
your hairstyle? <p>
This question is a guiding mechanism to efficiently enable a route through the 
Responder’s largely unconscious path to congruent change. <p>
Here’s the big idea: using questions directed to help Others efficiently 
recognize their own route to Excellence, and change as appropriate vs. using 
questions to seek answers that benefit the Asker. This shift in focus alone 
creates an automatic trust. <p>
An example is a question we designed for Wachovia to increase sales and 
appointments. Instead of seeking prospects for an appointment to pitch new 
products (i.e. using appointments as a sales tool), we designed questions to 
immediately facilitate discovery of need, taking into account most small 
businesses already have a banking relationship. After trialing a few different 
FQs, our opening question became: How would you know when it&#39;s tme to consider 
adding new banking parnters, for those times your current bank can&#39;t give you 
what you need? This question shifted the response to 100 prospecting calls from 
10 appointments and 2 closes over 11 months, to 37 invites to meet from the 
prospect, and 29 closes over 3 months. Facilitative Questions helped the right 
prospects engage immediately.<p>
When used with coaching clients, buyers, negotiation partners, advertisements, 
or even teenagers, these questions create action within the Responder, causing 
them to recognize internal incongruences and deficiencies, and be guided through 
their own options. (Because these questions aren’t natural to us, I’ve designed 
a tool and program to teach the ‘How’ of formulating them.).<p>
The responses to FQs are quite different from conventional questions. So when 
answering How would you know if it were time to reconsider your hairstyle?’ the 
Responder is directed by word use, word placement, and an understanding of 
systems, to think of time, history, people, ego, comparisons, family. Instead of 
pulling data, you’re directing to, guiding through, and opening the appropriate 
change ‘boxes’ within the Responder’s unconscious Status Quo. It’s possible 
Responders will ultimately get to their answers without Facilitative Questions, 
but using them, it’s possible to help Responders organize their change criteria 
very quickly accurately. Using Facilitative Questions, we must<ol>
				<li>Enter with a blank brain, as a neutral navigator, servant leader, with a goal 
to facilitate change.</li>
				<li>Trust our Communication Partners have their own answers.</li>
				<li>Stay away from information gathering or data sharing/gathering until they are 
needed at the end.</li>
				<li>Focus on helping the Other define, recognize, and understand their system so 
they can discover where it’s broken.</li>
				<li>Put aside ego, intuition, assumptions, and ‘need to know.’ We’ll never 
understand another’s subjective experience; we can later add our knowledge.</li>
				<li>Listen for systems, not content.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
FQs enable congruent, systemic, change. I recognize this is not the conventional 
use of questions, but we have a choice: we can either facilitate a Responder’s 
path down their own unique route and travel with them as Change Facilitators – 
ready with our ideas, solutions, directions as they discover a need we can 
support - or use conventional, biased questions that limit possibility. For 
change to occur, people must go through these change steps anyway; we’re just 
making it more efficient for them as we connect through our desire to truly 
Serve. We can assist, or wait to find those who have already completed the 
journey. They must do it anyway: it might as well be with us.<p>
I welcome opportunities to put Facilitative Questions into the world. 
Formulating them requires a new skill set that avoids any bias (Listening for 
Systems, for example). But they add an extra dimension to helping us all serve 
each other.<p>
