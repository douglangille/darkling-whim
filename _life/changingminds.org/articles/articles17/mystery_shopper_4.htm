<p>Mystery shopping can be helpful for both the novice and the expert 
salesperson. It can help you expand your knowledge of the industry and 
competitors, but there is also a learning curve inherent in the mystery shopping 
process. </p>
<p>One of our new originators had just begun his calls and was talking to a 
lender who wondered, 'If you're a lender, why call us (the lender) to ask these 
questions?' Of course, our enthusiastic shopper realized that caller I.D. had 
revealed his name. He quickly finished the call and found the solution--block 
caller I.D.--then left the office on an errand. Upon his return an hour later, I 
stopped him and asked loudly, 'Any idea why we haven't received any calls, not a 
single customer or prospect, since you've been out? That's especially alarming 
considering we ran a newspaper ad this <br>
weekend.' His puzzled expression confirmed that he didn't have the <br>
answer. </p>
<p>Later that day, the sales manager from our unsuccessfully mystery- <br>
shopped competitor called me with an unusual announcement: 'For <br>
the last hour we've been getting calls from people wanting to talk <br>
with you. It's great that we're getting all of these inquiries, but most <br>
of them really want you.' After some additional checking with our <br>
phone system, we found the cause of these misdirected calls. When <br>
attempting to block caller I.D. on his prior mystery shopping <br>
exercise, our originator inadvertently set the call forwarding code, <br>
ensuring that all incoming calls were sent directly to the competitor. </p>
<p>Mystery shoppers also have to be careful about the personal <br>
information they provide. Another Gold Star originator was <br>
contacting various lenders to obtain their rates and other details. He <br>
spent a full day speaking with different representatives from online <br>
and local lenders. He finally walked into my office, sat down and <br>
said in a concerned voice, 'Dan, I have been calling all these <br>
companies and having them run scenarios for me and then <br>
reviewing the presentations. The last guy said my credit score was <br>
almost 100 points less than where it was when I started the day.' I <br>
looked up and asked, 'Have you been giving these companies your <br>
social security number?' He nodded sheepishly and responded, 'Of <br>
course, how else would I get their rates and programs?' He <br>
ultimately had 15 different companies run his credit, which severely <br>
damaged his record. It took him several weeks to have all the <br>
inquiries removed. A good tip for mystery shoppers Ð Don't give out <br>
your SSN. </p>
<p>I learned my own valuable lesson, to use a different name <br>
when mystery shopping. During a presentation to our sales team, I <br>
called a Connecticut lender to inquire about their programs, rates <br>
and overall service. 'I'm in Hartford (CT) and just found a property <br>
that I'd like to close on as soon as possible,' I began. 'I want to see <br>
if you can help me.' <br>
'I'm sure we can,' the loan officer said. 'Can I get your <br>
name?' <br>
'Daniel Milstein,' I answered. <br>
There was a brief pause and then, 'The Dan Milstein?' <br>
'Yes,' I replied, happily surprised that he would know my <br>
name, but also aware that I would not gather much intelligence from <br>
this call. I sensed some irritation as the loan officer advised me that <br>
he wouldn't be able to help me after all. </p>
<p>Mystery shopping can help you succeed as a salesperson, but there are many 
tips you should know before beginning the calls--block your number, use a fake 
name, never give out your social security number. </p>
