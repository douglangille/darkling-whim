Recognize Buyers on the First Call</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
A participant at one of my onsite Buying Facilitation® trainings took me to his 
desk where he scrolled through pages of names of one-contact prospects who’d 
ignored his follow up attempts. “What do I do with all of these names? They’re 
buyers. How can I get them to take my call?”<p>
I scrolled through the hundreds of names, noticed the many dates of attempted 
follow up after each name, and told him to give me his finger. “My finger?” 
“Yes”, I said. “Use it to press the delete key. You’re wasting your time.”<h2>
NEED DOES NOT EQUAL SALE</h2>
<p>
Doing what sales professionals are supposed to do, this salesman sought out 
potential prospects with a ‘need’ his solution could resolve, assuming need = 
prospect. With pages of names and untold wasted hours calling, calling, calling 
them back (time he could have used to find real buyers), valiantly seeking a 
sale among those he assumed most likely, there was something he wasn’t 
understanding: just because it seemed to him there was a fit, didn’t mean these 
people were buyers. <p>
Walk this back with me: Sales professionals have been taught that a prospect is 
someone with a ‘need’ that matches the benefits of their solution - someone who 
SHOULD buy, or likely to be a candidate to buy – and with the ‘right’ course of 
action, they can convert this prospect to a buyer. But after years of coming up 
with ‘new’ sales methods, closing techniques, e-tools, etc. etc. that employ the 
‘right’ approach to target prospects, introduce the content in the ‘best’ way 
with the most efficient messaging, and finding hundreds, thousands, with a 
supposed need who don’t buy, we know ‘need’ does not equal Sale. <p>
The mystery to me is why we keep doing it and telling ourselves that, even with 
a 5% close rate, what we’re doing is working. Has it never occurred that just 
maybe we’re doing something wrong? The truth is, selling doesn’t cause buying. 
Yet we keep doing the same thing and accept as normal the low close rates and 
silence from those we deem buyers. Nothing in this process works efficiently. We
<ul>
	<li>obviously can’t recognize a real buyer; </li>
	<li>don&#39;t know if we&#39;re reading the situation accurately and maybe this person 
isn&#39;t, and will never be, a buyer;</li>
	<li>assume that we position our pitch/presentation/marketing using the ‘right’ 
approach; </li>
	<li>have little indication if our skills cause a sale to close – or even who might 
be the most effective recipients to target; </li>
	<li>sit and wait and hope for call backs, continually moving the dates on our 
pipeline forward; </li>
	<li>don’t know who will finally show up and buy.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
Sellers can’t even identify prospects who will buy from their pipeline. After 
asking hundreds of sellers who among their current prospects will definitely 
buy, no one, in my entire 35 years of sales training and consulting, ever has 
more than a guess. But that’s because it’s not possible to know who will be a 
buyer on the first call using the current sales focus of seeking people with 
‘need’. <p>
And herein lies the problem: by entering prospecting calls with goals, 
expectations, and listening patterns that assume we can recognize a real buyer, 
or when we find someone with a ‘need’ we&#39;ve got a prospect, or by sending out 
content marketing cleverly introducing features and functions, we not only chase 
those who may never buy (the majority), but overlook an entirely different set 
of criteria for finding those who CAN buy: people who are willing and able to 
change. That’s right: the criteria for finding someone who will/can buy is 
wholly dependent on whether they are willing and able to change. For those of 
you who find this concept unusual, I’ll lead you through this.<h2>
CHANGE IS THE CRITERIA, NOT NEED</h2>
	<p>
Did you buy a gym membership (or get coaching, or lose weight, or…) when you 
first recognized a ‘need’ or when you were (finally) ready to make a change? How 
long did you have the ‘need’ before you actually did something about it? When 
you finally took action, it had nothing to do with the gym membership or the 
coach; you were ready and willing to change, to take action now (yes, now), find 
the time, develop new habits, make it a priority over something else you were 
doing with that time, have the funds, etc. ‘Need’ may inspire a consideration to 
do something different, but does not constitute the action to do it.<p>
When we enter a conversation believing that someone with a ‘need’ is a buyer, we 
ignore<ul>
		<li>how our biased questions (based on discovering ‘need’) cause responses that 
may seem to imply a need, or</li>
		<li>how our biased listening assures we can confirm we found someone who SHOULD 
buy, very often missing the full range of meaning, overlooking those who 
CAN/WILL buy but aren’t quite ready yet, or </li>
		<li>the vast difference between ‘need’ and ability/willingness to undertake the 
change process inherent in a purchase.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
Think about it: why would anyone spend time listening to a stranger (yes, you’re 
a stranger) or reading content, unless they want something? Here’s the rule: if 
someone is in the early stages of scoping stuff out and hasn’t yet realized they 
might need to buy something, or haven&#39;t yet adjusted for how making a purchase 
would affect their status quo, they have no reason to spend time with you, 
regardless need, or the efficacy of your solution. Therefore, with our solution 
placement outreach methods we merely attract:<ol>
			<li>people doing research for solutions to create themselves or give to their 
current vendors;</li>
			<li>folks examining differences between features of your solution vs how they’re 
handling the problem internally;</li>
			<li>people with the same buying patterns as your selling patterns (those willing 
to read an article, or speak to a stranger, or go to an intro meeting, for 
example);</li>
			<li>those with a real need who will be buyers once they have all their ducks in a 
row.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
Even if we&#39;re connecting in response to a request for more information or a 
referral, we&#39;re entering as a solution seeking a problem without considering the 
range of activities (the internal change management elements) necessary before 
someone can buy. We forget that between recognizing a problem and taking actions 
to resolve it (adopt something new), essential steps must occur (I wrote a book 
on this. Take a look: www.dirtylittlesecretsbook.com) to<ul>
				<li>determine that, indeed a change is necessary (or retain the status quo if 
change isn’t feasible);</li>
				<li>to get agreement that the problem can’t be resolved with familiar solutions 
and needs an external fix;</li>
				<li>to know how to manage the disruption that will ensue (any additions or 
subtractions to the status quo causes disruption); </li>
				<li>to facilitate the buy in of everyone involved.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
In other words, sales shares data prematurely, before people even know what to 
listen for; listens for ‘buying signals’ that don’t exist; overlooks those who 
WILL become buyers but don’t yet understand they need us. Our prospects are 
restricted to the low hanging fruit who already know they need us, ensuring we 
play a numbers game as everyone fights to close the same pool of ready buyers. 
If they were fully cognizant of what they needed AND had the internal buy-in to 
make a purchase AND knew how much discombobulation they’d face, they would have 
gone online and contacted us already. To find real buyers on the first call, we 
need a different listening bias and goal to recognize those who are willing to 
change.<h2>
THE SALES MODEL RESTRICTS DISCOVERY</h2>
				<p>
I’ve been told the ‘million dollar question’ is knowing who is a buyer on the 
first call. And yet, it’s simple. Here are two examples of me making a cold call 
to a Sales Director. I entered both conversations with the same Facilitative 
Question (FQ – a new form of question I developed that facilitates discovery 
without biasing choice or attempting to gather data): How are you currently 
adding new sales skills to the ones your folks now use for those times you seek 
to augment specific outcomes? Just from the responses to my opening question, 
it&#39;s easy to recognize which person is a buyer.<p class="quote">
Responder A: Every year I read 6 sales books. I then buy copies of my favorite 
one for each sales person, and ask them to meet once a month to discuss how to 
incorporate the ideas into their selling.<p class="quote">
Responder B: Good question. I’ve certainly tried, but I haven’t been successful. 
I keep training my folks with the newest sales methods, and it hasn’t seemed to 
make a difference. Not sure if I’m using the right training methods, or I just 
need to fire all of my sales folks and start all over. Or maybe something we’re 
doing internally that’s causing the results. I sure wish I knew the answer.<p>
Which one is the prospect? B, of course. Do they both have a need? Probably. But 
it’s clear who’d be willing to change. Notice I entered the conversation to help 
the prospect start thinking about change, not to try to find a match between my 
solution and a need, or find someone (um, the ‘decision maker?’) who would 
listen to a pitch (why do we assume that our glorious pitch and content will 
rule the day, after thousands of people ignore us?). Different from conventional 
sales approaches that enter to discover a &#39;need&#39; or attempt to &#39;gather 
information&#39;, my opening FQ used vocabulary that restricted the conversation to 
where change would occur, while providing me information on their willingness to 
change. <p>
And it’s quite important to understand that by entering the conversation with an 
entirely different focus, the rest of the conversation and the resultant human 
connection, the ability to find a real buyer and make a sale, is quite different 
from a seller entering to sell their solution.<p>
The problem has never been our solution or their need. The part we’ve left out 
of sales is change. Every purchase, every add-on involves shifting the status 
quo in some way – assuredly causing some form of disruption; unless a prospect 
knows how change with minimal disruption they can’t buy anything regardless of 
their need or my solution. I ask you: Do you want to sell? Or have someone buy? 
They are two distinctly different activities. And we’re only focused on the 
selling – all the while ignoring real buying opportunities that require some 
change facilitation rather than solution placement bias.<h2>
RECOGNIZING AND FACILITATING CHANGE BEFORE SELLING</h2>
				<p>
Do you know what an exchange sounds like with a real buyer? Training Buying 
Facilitation® to small business bankers at Wachovia, we opened with a 
Facilitative Question that produced great results: “How are you currently adding 
new banking resources for those times you need additional support?” This 
question<ol>
					<li>focused on having clients consider their status quo.</li>
					<li>assumed they had some sort of banking relationship (which all small 
businesses have).</li>
					<li>offered add on support (so much less disruption to ‘add’ rather than 
‘change’).</li>
					<li>got them to begin thinking if change were a viable activity.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
Of course the discussion involved further facilitation, but this FQ opened the 
dialogue and, importantly, positioned the seller as a facilitator enabling 
Excellence rather than a sales person pushing solutions. Using this process, the 
results were profound: the control group, asking for appointments to present 
their new small business banking services, got 10 appointments out of 100, 
closing 2 in 11 months. Using Buying Facilitation® and starting with the above 
Facilitative Question (and no pitch!), my group got 39 appointments; they closed 
half in the first 2 months, then half of the remainder in the next month. So in 
3 months, they closed approximately 30 prospects. Same list, same product. But 
by starting from a change consideration, we found – and then efficiently 
facilitated - real buyers. The other group merely uncovered those who recognized 
a willingness to seek a new banker but still weren’t in a position to change 
(i.e. notice the difference in closing times). The most interesting thing was 
how little time it took to close those willing to change once the seller 
facilitated the prospect through their change and buy-in determinants.<p>
A buying decision is a change management problem before it’s a solution choice 
issue. Making a purchase or choosing a vendor is the last thing – the last thing 
- a prospect will do. If we eschew a ‘selling’ focus as an entry, and instead 
focus on change, we can find those willing and able to consider change and 
facilitate them through their steps of change – enlist buy-in; design a way to 
maintain what’s working while adding new solutions to ensure continuity; manage 
people issues and internal politics – changing with minimal disruption. But it 
demands an entirely different skill set and entry point. </p>
<p>My Buying Facilitation® model has coded every step buyers must go through to 
discover how, when, and if, to make a change and leads them through the 
non-buying, systems-focused steps necessary without the bias of sales; different 
from sales, and used as the first step before a solution is actually introduced 
(although the questions are posed around the area my solution can resolve) it 
operates as a change facilitation approach that consists of different skills 
from sales - Facilitative Questions, Listening for Systems, and Presumptive 
Summaries to facilitate discovery and manage change. </p>
<p>Buying Facilitation® can be employed in a fraction of the time it takes to 
pitch to a stranger; it reduces the failed follow up attempts to ensure we’re 
only following up with those who WILL buy, and teach them how they CAN buy. And 
then, employ our brilliant sales approach to the right buyers. It’s win win. 
What would you need to know about the learning process to understand how Buying 
Facilitation® would enable you to close more, waste less time, and serve more 
clients efficiently? Call me. I’ll teach you how to do it.<p>
