Facilitating Compliance: helping patients choose health</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In the late 1970s, I approached my studies for an MSc in Health Sciences 
(Community Health Education) with an idealistic goal to create ways to promote 
wellness and prevent disease. Although life took me in a different direction, 
I’ve tried to stay caught up on healthcare, but now have merely a passing 
understanding of what’s going on. Lately I’ve had some opportunities to look 
more intimately into the healthcare profession/industry, and I’m both gladdened 
and saddened.<p>
On the plus side, there’s a committed effort in this country to assist the 
under-served. Food services that offer nutrition to hospitals and training in 
healthy eating for patients; outpatient groups for treatment and prevention for 
diabetes, obesity, heart disease, cancer sufferers; school lunches and Pre-K 
programs. I hadn’t been aware of the extent, or creativity, of the outreach of 
caregiving professionals. (How could I have known this? News sources focus on 
the bad stuff.). Esther Dyson’s Wellville.net, for example, even lets us track 
the progress of 5 groups of caregivers around the US as they design and 
implement innovative projects to promote preventative health care. We’re on our 
way to understanding that prevention is preferable to relying on treatment. <p>
The bad news is that some easily treatable or preventable conditions (diabetes, 
heart conditions, cancer, obesity) are not garnering the necessary buy-in from 
patients to make the needed healthy choices. With the best will in the world, 
providers - intent on designing outreach programs to encourage change and choice 
- are facing non-compliance: even with adequate funding, multi-faceted 
prevention services, and supervised support, patients are not adopting the 
necessary changes that have the capability of making a difference in their long 
term health. What’s going on? <p>
The problem is that the methods we’re using to inspire healthful behavior aren’t 
facilitating compliance. But with a shift in thinking, buy-in is achievable. Let 
me begin with a brief discussion of change and how our ‘system’, our status quo, 
fights to remain stable regardless of its (in)effectiveness. Buy-in is a change 
management problem.<h2>
STATUS QUO</h2>
<p>
We’re intelligent. We know smoking and sugar are bad, that exercise and fresh 
veggies are good. Yet we continue to smoke and eat sweets. We know that telling, 
advising, or offering ‘relevant’ and ‘rational’ information is largely 
ineffective and invokes resistance. Yet we continue to tell, advise, and 
suggest, knowing even before we start that the odds of success are against us, 
and blaming the Other for non-compliance. <p>
We all tend to continue our current behaviors, hoping we’ll get different 
results (Hello, Einstein.), finding things to blame, or new approaches using the 
same thinking. The problem is that any change is a systems problem that demands 
buy-in from the very rules that created the status quo. And buy-in is much more 
intricate than knowing there’s a problem, or offering good ideas and 
recommendations, or getting people to sign up for healthful activities. <p>
Let’s look at the problem from a different lens. Let’s understand why people 
keep doing what they do, regardless of any evidence that points to a need for 
other options. Each person, each family (everyone, actually), is idiosyncratic 
but made congruent through an internal – often unconscious - system of rules and 
goals, beliefs and values, history and foundational norms. It’s our status quo; 
it represents who we are and the organizing principles that we wake up with 
every morning; it’s habitual, normalized, accepted, and replicated day after day 
– including what created the identified problem to begin with - with the 
problems baked in, and will do whatever it takes to remain its own unique brand 
of congruent.<p>
</p>
<p>Any proposed change challenges the status quo, offering a potentially 
disruptive outcome. When a problem shows up, diabetes for example, the patient 
has a dilemma: either continue their comfortable patterns and be assured of a 
continued problem, or dismantle the status quo and risk disruption with 
unknowable consequences. How does she get up every day if she needs to eat 
differently and must convince her family that the food they’ve been eating for 
generations isn’t healthy? How does she avoid desert when the family is 
celebrating? And the family’s favorite recipe is her cookies!<p>
Change means the status quo has to reconfigure itself around 
new/different/unknown rules, beliefs, and outcomes to become something that can 
maintain itself with the ‘new’ as normalized. Because - and this is important to 
understand – until people<ul>
	<li>recognize that something is wrong/ineffective,</li>
	<li>recognize that whatever they&#39;ve been doing unconsciously has created (and will 
maintain) the problem, </li>
	<li>know how to make congruent change that includes core values and systems norms,
	</li>
	<li>know exactly the level of disruption that will occur to the status quo, and
	</li>
	<li>make a belief shift that is acceptable to the rest of the system and enables 
new behaviours, </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
they will not change, regardless of its efficacy of the value of the solution. 
In other words, until or unless someone recognizes that change can be 
accomplished without permanent disruption to who they are and how they live, AND 
are willing/able to do the deeply internal work of designing new habits, 
beliefs, and goals, AND manage any fallout, people will not change regardless of 
their need or your solution. [Note: I’ve been teaching the same premise to sales 
folks and coaches for decades.] </p>
<p>Why isn’t a rational argument, or an obvious problem, enough to inspire 
behavior change? Because we’re dealing with long-held patterns, habits, and 
normalized activities and beliefs that represent the status quo and identity of 
the person. And because we’re trying to push change from the outside – usually 
through information, advice, and activities – before the system has figured out 
how to change itself congruently.<h2>
THE INTRICACY OF BUY-IN </h2>
	<p>
With the best will in the world, we’re trying to cause change in the wrong 
place, in the wrong way, at the wrong time. We try to offer new choices, new 
behaviors, before we have enabled internal, unconscious agreement to change. And 
here’s the interesting bit: behaviors will change themselves once the core 
beliefs have shifted (i.e. I must go to the gym because I’m a Healthy Person, as 
that’s one way I define Healthy. And I hate going. But I must because I&#39;m a 
Healthy Person.). By focusing on behavior change before facilitating belief 
change, our approach is actually creating resistance because our status quo 
must, by the laws of Systems Congruence, maintain our status quo at all costs 
(literally). <p>
Behaviors are merely the expression – the representation - of our beliefs. Think 
of it this way: behaviors express our beliefs much like the functionality of a 
software program is a result of the coding in the programming. To change the 
output of a software program, you don’t start by changing the functionality; you 
first change the coding which automatically changes the functionality. <p>
It’s the same with any human change: failure ensues when we focus on changing 
the output of the program (in this case, behaviors) rather than focusing first 
on adapting the source. Like a dummy terminal, our behaviors only do what its 
programming allows them to do. Trying to explain why a different output, or 
behavior, is necessary is useless, even when our information is ‘rational’ or 
‘right’. <p>
Here’s what happens. When influencers believe that if they share, advise, 
gather, or promote the right information in the right way, using the right words 
and offering good rational reasons why change is necessary, Others will comply. 
But our patients<ul>
		<li>hear us through biased filters and cannot hear our message as meant;</li>
		<li>feel pushed to act in ways they’re unaccustomed to or that go against their 
beliefs;</li>
		<li>resist and reject when expected to act in ways currently outside their norm;</li>
		<li>lose trust in us when we push them.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
Our patients cannot even consider, understand, or recognize the validity of, our 
information appropriately. Everyone actually listens through biased filters that 
only allow us to hear what our brain determines it wants to hear to maintain our 
status quo; our brains filter in/out at will, leaving out concepts, words, 
meaning, and adding in concepts, words, meaning. We all do this unconsciously, 
leaving us to assume that what we hear is what’s been said. (Note: I just wrote 
a book about this – What? Did you really say what I think I heard? – and was 
quite surprised to learn how effectively our listening controls our status quo.) 
So my brain might tell me you said ABX when you actually meant ABC, and I 
believe my brain is accurate (and it didn’t tell me what it left out) and you&#39;re 
the one who remembered it wrong. We’re offering data that can’t even be heard or 
absorbed appropriately.<p>
So how can we effect compliance if offering information or diets or exercise 
programs, for example, isn’t effective?<h2>
PEOPLE CAN ONLY CHANGE THEMSELVES</h2>
		<p>
Start by recognizing that people change themselves; change can’t come from the 
outside. Instead of seeking better and better ways to offer plans, rules, and 
advice (and getting rejected and ignored), we must help people make their own 
discoveries and systemic changes and design a path to their own change so they 
can remain congruent. The sad truth that all influencers must understand is that 
the need for Systems Congruence is of greater importance (unconsciously) to the 
system than the need for change, regardless of how necessary the change is. 
That’s how people end up refusing smoking cessation programs when they have lung 
cancer, or continuing to eat unhealthful foods with diabetes (or voting for 
candidates that go against our best interest).<p>
Here are some ways you can enter a change conversation to enable buy-in and 
avoid resistance:<ol>
			<li><b>Shift your goal</b>. Your job is to help Another be all they can be. It’s not 
about you getting them to accept the change you believe necessary, but enabling 
them to design the change they need, in a way that concurs with their beliefs 
and values. </li>
			<li><b>Enter differently</b>. Enter with a goal/outcome of facilitating change and 
buy-in, not to change behavior. They must change their own behavior. From 
within. Their own way.</li>
			<li><b>Examine the status quo</b>. First help Others recognize and assemble all of the 
elements that created and maintain their status quo – not merely the ones 
involved with the problem as you perceive it, but the entire system that created 
and maintains it. Outsiders can’t recognize the full complement of givens within 
another’s status quo. Starting with a focus on what you perceive is the problem 
(or the Other recognizes as a problem but hasn’t consistently switched to the 
new behavior) inspires rejection. </li>
			<li><b>Traverse the brain’s steps to change</b>. There are 13 steps to change that must 
be traversed for all change to occur. Unless all – all – of the elements have 
been included, recognize a need to change, and know precisely how to make the 
appropriate shifts so a stable systems results, they will resist.</li>
			<li><b>Behavior is an expression and not a unique act</b>. We must recognize that 
exhibited behaviors are expressing beliefs. Change must occur at the belief 
level. Trying to push or inspire behavior change is at the wrong level and 
causes resistance.</li>
			<li><b>Everyone has their own answers</b>. They may not be what you would prefer and 
might not make sense given the outcomes. Help them recognize how and when and if 
to change. But not using information as it can’t be understood.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Here are some examples of how I’ve added Change Facilitation to elements of 
health care in a way that promotes belief change first (Note: these below 
exemplify only a portion of what would need to be included on forms, in groups, 
etc.):</p>
			<p>
<b>Intake forms</b>: instead of merely gathering the data you think you need (which 
you&#39;ve inadvertently biased), why not enlist patient buy-in at the earliest 
opportunity? It’s possible to add a few Facilitative Questions (I developed a 
form of question that enables unbiased systemic change. It uses no information 
gathering and has no bias. See examples below.) to your forms to start the 
patient off recognizing you, and including you, as a partner at the very 
beginning of your relationship and their route to healthful choices:<p class="quote">
<i>We are committed to helping you achieve the goals you want to achieve. What 
would you need to see from us to help you down your path to health? What could 
we do from our end that would best enable you to make whatever changes you might 
want to make?</i><p>
<b>Group prevention/treatment</b>: instead of starting off by sharing new food or 
exercise plans, let’s add some change management skills to the goals of the 
group. By giving them direction around facilitating each other&#39;s change issues, 
we can enable the group discuss potential fallout to any proposed change, 
determine what change would look like, and begin discussions on how to approach 
each aspect of risk together to recognize different paths to success. Then the 
whole group can support each other’s different paths to success:<p class="quote">
<i>As we form this group, what would we all need to believe to incorporate 
everyone’s needs into our goals? If there are different goals and needs, how do 
we best support each other to ensure we each achieve our goals?</i><p>
<b>Doctor/patient communication</b>: instead of a medical person offering ideas or 
information, make sure you achieve buy-in for change first. This encourages the 
trust/belief that the professional has the patient’s success in mind, rather 
than a dependence on the information (and viewpoint) they wish to espouse.<p class="quote">
<i>It seems you are suffering from diabetes. We’ve got nutritional programs, group 
support, book recommendations. But I’d first like to help you determine what 
health means for you. How will you know when it’s time to consider shifting some 
of your health choices to open up a possibility of treating your diabetes in a 
way that doesn’t diminish your lifestyle?</i><p>
<b>A healthy patient is the goal</b>. Be willing to enable change and 
compliance, rather than attempt to manage it, influence it, or control it. <p>
