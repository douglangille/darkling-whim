Putting People First: the path to Customer Centricity</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Charlie Rose interviewed Brian Moynihan, the CEO of Bank of America, recently as 
he discussed their new Customer Focus initiative: prioritizing Customer 
Centricity over revenue by putting their customers first. He said something 
like, ‘The money will come. Let’s take care of the customer!’ I haven’t noticed 
many companies, including Bank of America, who’ve actually done the work of 
re-organizing around customers; to be Customer Centric means you must put rules, 
staff, tasks, websites and customer interfaces in place to, um, put People 
first.<h2>
DEFINITION CUSTOMER-CENTRIC </h2>
<p>My long-held ideas and questions on what a true Customer Centric company 
would look like begins with an admonition: stop making it so hard on your 
customers. They purchased something from you. That automatically puts them in a 
relationship with you (And probably in a leadership position, since if customers 
don’t buy anything you’re not in business at all.). They paid the price you set 
and trusted your promises enough to believe they’d get what they paid for. If 
they have problems, questions or needs, their resolution and your kindness are a 
representation of your promise, must be a part of the relationship, and cannot 
be separated from the purchase. </p>
<p>You claim you want ‘relationship’ with customers, yet you create rules that 
disrespect, offend, ignore, insult, and frustrate them. Your customers have 
bought-into being on your team; don’t make it so hard on them. All that does is 
cause customers to complain to their 1000 closest friends, damage your 
reputation and give your competition the competitive edge. You forget that your 
customers are your competitive advantage. </p>
<p>‘Putting the customer at the center’ means having rules, procedures, hiring 
and training practices, and baseline values that use a People filter. It demands 
a customer lens through which to view every aspect of your company. It demands 
that your customer be the heart and soul of your company. </p>
<p><b>Corporate identity</b>: Since behaviors and rules are translations - the daily 
actions - of your foundational identity and values, a Customer Centric company 
has the commensurate People values and ethics at its core. I always ask myself, 
after being hung up on, or ignored, or disrespected by a contact with a company 
whose solution I’ve purchased, what the foundational beliefs of that company 
must be: That I’ve made a purchase from the wrong provider - a company that 
doesn’t care about me. That my problems and needs are secondary to profit. That 
I’m not worthy of care once I’v. ade my purchase. </p>
<p>It must begin with an identity of ethics and integrity. How you accomplish 
this will take the work of change – assembling and assessing the broken 
elements, getting buy-in for change from each of the broken parts, addressing 
disruption and confusing implementations. There are lots of decisions to be made 
that will ripple through the company. </p>
<p><b>Stakeholder alignment</b>: All stakeholders, all company employees, all managers 
and Board Directors, must share, exemplify, and communicate the exact same 
beliefs and values. Your marketing and customer service must portray your 
kindness and respect; you’ll hire people with values that match. There used to 
be a legend that Nordstrom had a one line customer service rule: “Use your best 
judgment.” Imagine how hiring practices, management, and training shift if such 
rule is in place. <p>
With a People orientation, everything and everyone has one goal: to keep a 
customer happy. Then, a lower level rep would feel free to make this sort of 
adjustment on her own: <p class="quote">
So sorry this is happening. Please accept my apologies on behalf of X company. 
What would make this right for you? And I’ll be your Team Leader to make sure 
your problem gets handled, including speak to whoever I need to speak with on my 
side and get back to you with a resolution.<p>
</p>
<p>not this rule-based, disrespecting flip-off that we all suffer time and time 
again:<p>
</p>
<p class="quote">This is not something I can take care of. I’m transferring you (and 
transferring you, and transferring you, and…).<p>
With a Customer Centric filter, each rep, each internal stakeholder, each person 
who touches a customer, owns the problem and resolution. This will change your 
rules.<p>
One more thought here: your employees are your first customers. Don’t ever 
forget that. </p>
<p><b>Proximity to customer</b>: With ‘Customer’ in the center, organization is based 
on the proximity to the customer, giving the most importance (and training) to 
help desk and sales groups who directly touch customers, and Senior Management, 
the Board and CEO at the far end with the job of coming up with the ideas and 
maintaining the foundation of values and vision. </p>
<h2>ORGANIZING A CUSTOMER CENTRIC COMPANY FROM INSIDE OUT </h2>
<p>In order of customer proximity, here are some thoughts on the organization of 
a truly Customer Centric company. Again, each customer touch point must have a 
criteria of putting the focus on People first, with Task, Rules and Profit 
Margin second.<p>
</p>
<h3>First touch point:</h3>
<blockquote>
	<p>• <b>Customer service</b> (questions, needs, problems): Reps whose job is to give 
product service and support must be client advocates. They must have a very 
strong People filter and be passionate about ensuring each customer gets their 
needs met. That should be their only criteria and have the right tools and 
skills - listening skills are especially prone to biased filters - at their 
disposal to do so.</blockquote>
<p>
I’ve been told by customer service reps that they’re only allotted a short time 
frame – minutes – to handle a problem and then get on to the next customer on 
the cue. One rep called me back on his own cell phone because he didn’t want to 
‘get in trouble’ (his words) for taking too long with a customer. Seriously?! Of 
course this means you’d need to train your team differently. And yes, you’ll 
need to hire more reps to get them off ‘the clock’ and into ‘relationship.’ Keep 
thinking: People vs Task. Which will it be? Here are two conversations I had 
with different ATT reps, 5 minutes apart, when I called to change my billing 
address. I bet you can tell which one has a People filter:<p>
</p>
<p>Rep #1: You don’t have your password? Sorry. I can’t help you. I know you 
only want to change your address. But call back when you find your password….. 
(And then she hung up on me).<p>
Rep #2: You don’t have your password? Hm… Let’s use your social security number 
to start with. Then we can change your address, and then I’ll send you a link to 
reset your password so you have it for the next time you call.<p>
</p>
<p>Same company; but one rep was Task/Rules-bound with no criteria re taking 
care of me and just wanted to get me off the phone quickly; one was Customer 
Centric and got creative so I was cared for. Both had the same customer screen 
in front of them when I called but one had a People hat on. And btw, who the 
hell was supervising that first Rep? Why was that ok? Do companies even KNOW 
what their representatives are saying to customers?<p>
</p>
<p>I urge you to consider having whoever answers the phone ‘own’ the customer’s 
problem. This way customers don’t get hung up on, and don’t get shuffled between 
departments to explain their issue over and over again – only to be disconnected 
after 45 minutes and on maybe the 6th person! The initial rep must take the 
customer’s phone number, give them a case number, and a call-back number that 
connects directly TO THE PERSON THEY SPOKE WITH so there is a continued process. 
How much will that cost? Compare that with the amount of business and reputation 
you’re losing now from NOT doing it, from complaints against your company 
showing up on social media, from customers cancelling service because they can’t 
take it anymore.<p>
</p>
<p>Website: Your site is often the first (and sometimes only) connection with a 
customer and it can go a long way to making sure customers feel cared for. Here 
is where a lot of companies fail. Almost all sites are strictly Rules, Company, 
Profit, Product driven. There’s no way to talk to anyone, and lots of hoops to 
go through before it’s even a vague possibility.<p>
</p>
<p>Few sites have their phone number available. What’s the deal with that? How 
much business are you losing because a customer or prospect can’t ask a simple 
question, or get directed to their best resource? What is the cost? I buy only 
from companies whose sites offer a phone number so I know I’ll have fewer hoops 
to go through if there’s a problem.<p>
</p>
<p>And what’s the deal with ONLY having the sign-in boxes in the Contact area? 
You’re soliciting their data for your marketing lists and reducing their ability 
to make contact only according to YOUR terms? You want something precious from 
them and you’re not willing to offer something in return? What percentage of 
real buyers won’t fill out those things? I have never, ever filled out one of 
those damn things. I want my vendors to take care of ME, not me take care of 
THEM, especially when it might involve me receiving tons of unsolicited email.<p>
</p>
<p>And while I’m on a rant, how ‘bout including a real time Customer Tweet roll 
bar on your home page? Invite customers to Tweet their thoughts, questions, and 
feelings to make it a living dialogue. Too scary you say? Well, if you focus on 
a customer, and all your rules are similarly focused, you should hear nothing 
but good things, no? And where there’s a negative comment, it will exhibit how 
quickly and accurately you handle the situation. After all, these folks are 
going onto social media to complain about you anyway; you might as well hear it 
straight and deal with it immediately and show other customers your fallible, 
but trustworthy.<p>
</p>
<p>This is your first line of contact. You can use your site as a good 
representation of your brand’s promise. You’re blowing it.<blockquote>
	<p>• Live Chat/Bot: With a People focus, online communication tools must abandon 
their Rules/Task focus and use vocabulary that is helpful, soothes disgruntled 
people, and finds ways to take responsibility for supportive dialogue. It’s 
beyond infuriating. I found myself recently having a fight with a Live Chat 
person (Well, 3 actually, because I kept asking to speak with a supervisor.) for 
2 hours (with horrible NameCheap) and finally SCREAMED in frustration at this 
invisible ‘person’ who kept explaining ‘rules’ that didn’t correspond to my 
questions; I actually wrote I HATE YOU YOU’RE A TERRIBLE COMPANY AND YOU CHEAT 
PEOPLE AND I’M GOING TO TELL EVERYONE NOT TO EVER USE YOU YOU’RE CHEATS. I 
became a tantrumy teenager as I felt more and more disrespected, misunderstood, 
and thwarted by invisible rules that didn’t seem to match my issue. Turns out 
not ONE of these folks heard me or resloved my problem. Don’t do this to your 
customers. They deserve better.</blockquote>
<h3>
Second touch point: </h3>
<blockquote>
	<p>• <b>Sales</b> – Sellers are the intermediaries between you and customers. Stop 
relegating them to a ‘content push’ orientation. Make them the arbiters of true 
customer focus. Instead of being focused on pushing/placing solutions, using a 
facilitation model such as Buying Facilitation® (a model I invented for sales 
and marketing that gives sellers tools to facilitate Buyer Readiness at each 
stage of their Pre-Sales Buying Journey) it’s possible to use your connection to 
become industry leaders and become true Servant Leaders. Stop pushing! They can 
find your solution data on your site! Use your sales team to build and enhance 
customer relationships based on THEIR needs for excellence, not YOUR needs for 
profit. This is a place you can truly differentiate yourself from your 
competition.</blockquote>
<p>
Customers don’t need you for the details of your solutions until they’ve decided 
they cannot fix the problem themselves, what sort of a solution everyone agrees 
to, and how to manage any change that will occur when they do buy. [A purchase 
is a change management problem before it’s a solution choice issue; a prospect 
is someone who CAN buy, not someone who SHOULD.] Your site might be one of their 
steps toward deciding on whether or not to buy anything. Help them. It will not 
only differentiate you, but you’ll have vast amounts of data to bring back to 
other groups in your organization to help them be more Customer Centric, 
including R&amp;D, customer service, manufacturing, billing. All areas of your 
company will shift according to the voices of real customers and their needs and 
problems – so long as the focus is on serving, not selling. Remember: People 
filter, not Task. Do you want to sell? Or have someone buy? Two different 
activities.<h3>
Third touch point: </h3>
<blockquote>
	<p>• <b>Day-to-day Management</b>: These folks are in leadership positions for employees 
nearest the customer. Instead of pushing pushing pushing staff to close a sale, 
or get off the phone, continually find ways to connect, to respond in ways that 
make, and keep, customers happy. That means you’ll not only need to hire a 
people-oriented management staff, but the employees will need new types of 
training, especially additional listening skills. Currently, each group listens 
through their own Task filters and agendas: sellers listen for signs of ‘need’, 
help desk reps listen for easy solutions so they can stick to their 2 minute (or 
whatever) time limit.</blockquote>
<p>
Have managers sit alongside of reps and coach them for hours during a week, to 
check their skills real time. You could even design a Customer Service Check 
List to hand out to managers for their phone coaching hours. Obviously you’ll 
have to employ new hiring practices to hire People oriented people rather than 
Task oriented people. Like the ATT story above, we all know to keep calling back 
until we get a ‘good’ rep. How much does that cost you?<p>
</p>
<p>Question for you: how will you know that the front-line staff are congruently 
representing your values? What is it costing you to have reps who hang up on 
paying customers? Or transfer transfer transfer to the point of madness because 
no one owns the problem? Why are managers acceding to this practice? What is it 
costing you?<h3>
Fourth touch point:</h3>
<blockquote>
	<p>• <b>Marketing</b>: your current focus remains selling something; your marketing 
efforts push product data, with no visible sign of Customer Centricity 
regardless of your lofty terms. What if you used your marketing to enter along 
the customer’s decision path to help them manage each aspect of their route to 
choosing you? They can get solution details on your site so add elements of 
facilitating the decisions that will make site visitors into customers.</blockquote>
<p>
Add a People/Customer filter to your marketing: send out content marketing that 
helps them make sense of those decisions they need to make as they figure out if 
they even want to make a purchase. It’s possible to create staged marketing to 
address each of the 13 stages of a buying decision. Because people aren’t buyers 
until a purchase is their only viable option to solve a problem, you’re missing 
entering earlier in their decision cycle and only focusing on those relative few 
who have already decided to buy (at the end of the buyer’s journey). Make it 
easier for those who CAN/WILL buy.<h2>
QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER </h2>
<p>Here are some questions you need to ask yourself moving forward: </p>
<ul>
	<li>What is the soul of your company? How can you operationalize that? Hint: Make 
sure you’re not a ‘financial company that serves customers’, and be a ‘customer 
centric company that offers banking services’. People first; it changes 
everything. </li>
	<li>What would you need to know or believe differently to be willing to make 
People your priority? How would that change your staffing? Sales? Marketing? 
Leadership? Training? Management? What is the cost? What is the cost if you 
don’t?</li>
	<li>How would you know it would be worthwhile to use a People filter over a 
Task/Rules filter? Would you need to have a pilot group with specific tracking 
capability re customer retention, or surveys, or increased revenue, etc.? [Call 
me. I’ll help you set it up.] A new Mission Statement? </li>
	<li>Where do Integrity and Ethics factor in to your customer touch points? Or is 
that not part of your equation? Do you have defined values? Do the rules you’re 
currently using match your company values? Why not? And don’t tell me it’s time 
or money – rescale if you need to. Your success depends on this. Amazon.com has 
an impressive focus on the customer. Takes me one minute to get a problem 
resolved, including them giving me my refund BEFORE they even get the product 
back – and often they tell me just to throw it away, or keep the extra item. 
They make it easy for me and actually less time consuming for them. I always 
feel trusted and valued, and I’ll never go to any of their competitors. </li>
	<li>How do your current rules restrict Customer Centricity? Evaluate your current 
rules. What new rules would need to be in place to be Customer Centric – and 
what does that mean for how you run your company? </li>
	<li>How would Customer Centricity change your hiring practices? Training? HR? 
Management? </li>
	<li>How will you know in advance that it will be worth the time/effort to tackle 
this? Because if you don’t, your competition will. Remember: your customer is 
your competitive advantage. </li>
	<li>What skills training would need to occur? Listening, certainly. </li>
	<li>What would need to change within your company culture? How people speak to 
each other? The symbols of success, expectations, agreements? </li>
	<li>How are you currently communicating your values to customers? Take a look at 
your site, your rules, your reps. What you see IS a representation of your 
corporate values. </li>
	<li>What promises are you making to customers who buy your solution? How does 
this differ from what a customer thinks you promised them? </li>
	<li>How would your technology need to change to embrace a Customer Centric 
mentality? In 1996 (before Google), I designed a new search tool named Hobbes 
based on helping a site visitors get to the exact page they needed using 3 
simple questions that highlight their choice criteria. I got an offer from the 
VC Heidi Roisen for funding if I could find one other funding source. I could 
not. And to this day, no one is using my search tool; seems tech folks never 
understood why sorting with human criteria is necessary. </li>
	</ul>
<p>I hope I’ve inspired you to begin thinking about this issue and started a 
conversation. I believe that becoming Customer Centric will be your competitive 
edge moving forward. But that also means change. What is it worth to you?<p>
