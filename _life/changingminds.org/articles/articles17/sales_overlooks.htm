How Sales Overlooks Buyers: Essay and Q&amp;A</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In 1993, when my first book came out and before he died, David Sandler called to 
buy out my Buying Facilitation® model. We couldn’t agree on terms, but he was 
excited by my differentiation between the sales model and the buying process: “I 
recognized that the problem was on the buy side, and thought my Sandler method 
was thinking out of the box. Reading your stuff, I now recognize my focus is 
still on getting solutions sold,” he said. “I hadn’t realized that ‘outside the 
box’ meant to shift the focus first to facilitate buying. Well done.” <p>
And yet, after all these years, the problem remains: we’re limiting success and 
wasting an untold amount of resource seeking those few who are ready, willing, 
and able to buy: we&#39;re missing a much larger, untapped market of potential (but 
real) buyers we ignore because our sales outreach doesn’t affect them. By 
broadening the goal to include facilitating change with those in the process of 
becoming buyers, by recognizing that a buying decision is a systemic, change 
management issue before it’s a solution choice problem, it’s feasible to engage 
earlier (albeit in a different way) and find a much larger population of real 
buyers.<h2>
HOW SALES RESTRICTS SELLING</h2>
<p>
The sales industry has a singular goal of placing solutions. It’s an industry 
with solutions looking for a problem. And the paltry results of a 5% close rate 
have been baked into the system: you accept low closing ratios as the best you 
can do, hire more sales people than you need, suffer from a sales cycle that is 
months/years longer than necessary, and lose buyers that will need your solution 
but don’t yet need or notice the information you provide.<p>
Have you never asked yourself why, with all the capability of finding 
prospective buyers at your fingertips, you still close only 5% - down from 7% a 
decade ago (and with much less technology)? And why you continue to waste untold 
bazillions on staff, technology, and time, chasing folks who will never buy. 
Have you not recognized that 
<ul>
	<li>the people you target aren’t necessarily buying or buyers, </li>
	<li>you’re expending too much resource on those who will never buy, </li>
	<li>you don’t know the difference between those who will and those who won’t buy?
	</li>
	</ul>
<p>
With the best technology available, the most professional branding and 
marketing, great content, and a good solid product, you’re losing far more sales 
than you need to. This much should be obvious: No matter how much new 
technology, or how many sales methods available to you – regardless of all the 
‘new new’ things at your fingertips - you’re still merely closing the low 
hanging fruit (those 5% who have determined they are ready, willing, able to 
buy). <p>
A buying decision is a change management problem before it’s a solution choice 
issue. By adding a few bells and whistles to your sales efforts you can find 
people who will be buying but aren’t yet buyers and facilitate their strategic 
Pre-Sales, non-solution-based decision path that concludes with them buying. 
Then you’ll close far more than you’re closing now with half the staff and half 
the time. But it needs different thinking.<h2>
SELLING VS BUYING</h2>
	<p>
People become buyers only when there are no other options and a purchase is 
their last hope for problem resolution. They can’t even accurately define a 
‘need’ until the full complement of stakeholders are involved and the scope of 
any resultant change is recognized. Sales ignores this group because their touch 
points are different and they are definitely not yet buyers. Yet it’s here 
they’re more open for support and connection: their path to congruently 
resolving a problem is confounding; they may forget to bring in “Joe from 
accounting”, or can&#39;t recognize the full scope of issues until they’ve falsely 
started down one path to resolution and must start all over. <p>
You’re a subject matter expert in the area of their problem resolution and could 
really be a support here – so long as you avoid trying to sell and focus on 
facilitating change first. This is where they will be eager to connect. By only 
focusing on selling/placing your solution, you ignore 40% of real buyers who 
haven’t gotten there yet but will. <p>
Ask yourself this: Do you want to sell – or have someone buy? They are two 
different activities with different rules, needs, and behaviors. Sales is 
tactical. Buying is strategic. Your tactical focus on placing solutions with 
Buyer Personas, Opportunity Management, content differentiation, and yes, even 
Sandler, SPIN etc. offer biased questions and content focused on those few who 
have defined, and understand, their need and change issues, overlooking those 
people in the midst of strategic decision efforts who will develop into buyers 
once they get their ducks in a row. Sellers actually sit and wait while 
prospects do this anyway. Why not help them! Here what sales ignores: 
	<ol>
		<li>A buying decision includes a 13 step change management process, the first 9 
steps of which are systemic change (not purchase or need) focused; they aren’t 
‘buyers’ until step 10 when all of their systemic/change management stuff is 
worked out, and there is agreement that a purchase is their only option. </li>
		<li>A problem doesn’t equal a need; a ‘need’ doesn’t equal a purchase. It might 
turn out that maintaining the status quo is a better option for them; as an 
outsider, you can never understand why.</li>
		<li>People aren’t buyers until they’re out of options to fix their problems 
themselves AND they&#39;ve gotten buy-in to bring in a &#39;foreign&#39; element. The last 
thing they want to do (precisely, the last thing) is to buy anything. The buyers 
you seek/find are already at the end of their decision path.</li>
		<li>Your terrific content isn’t being noticed by people who haven’t yet 
determined, defined, agreed upon a ‘need’ even though they may become buyers 
later, or even really need your solution.</li>
		<li>Your content/selling push assumes that with the right content and message, 
offered to the right demographic, at the right time, focused on the right need 
-&gt; purchase scenario, you’ll get in/close – but you’re only reaching those few 
who are ready OR those in the midst of their research (who may never buy but may 
call you with questions or take an appointment). They won&#39;t even read or heed 
your outreach.</li>
		<li>You’re using a ‘need’ and ‘solution-placement’ filter which restricts your 
results 95% of the time, causing you (beyond all logic) to push push push push 
harder or better, against a closed system of people and policies that’s not 
ready, willing, able to buy. </li>
		</ol>
		<p>
The problem is not your solution (It’s great. And people can find the content 
they need on line when they’re ready.); the problem is that the sales model 
places solutions with people who need them, but does nothing to help facilitate 
the change elements people traverse en route to becoming buyers and are not 
buyers yet. Here are the main stages people execute as they seek to resolve a 
problem (The full set of steps are laid out in my book Dirty Little Secrets: why 
buyers can’t buy and sellers can’t sell.):<ol>
			<li>Assemble the full set of stakeholders (including &quot;Joe in accounting&quot;) who 
spend time understanding the scope of the problem, how it got initiated, and how 
it maintains itself;</li>
			<li>Once a problem is defined by all stakeholders, the group tries to resolve the 
issue with familiar resources to minimize fallout. (This is where they might 
contact you with questions. They’re doing research, not buying.) </li>
			<li>Once it’s decided to seek an external solution, they must find a route to 
resolution that maintains Systems Congruence. So if your users refuse new 
technology, or your teams function well as they are, you might find a way around 
a purchase if the disruption is too great. An Outsider can never understand the 
unique nature of internal dynamics. Can I ever really understand why you don’t 
stop smoking, or stay in a dysfunctional relationship, or stay in a 
job/relationship that makes you miserable? Change is always personal.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
Notice how these stages are change- and systems-focused, and not accessible to 
Outsiders with a ‘sales’ hat on. And until they are addressed, there’s no ‘need’ 
and no ‘buyer&#39;. Btw, I developed these stages decades ago; they apply to anyone 
making a decision including coaching clients, patients, and employees, and all 
buying situations regardless of the size of the change/purchase. Whether you 
merely need to buy a new phone, or go through a merger, the steps of change must 
be traversed in a way that maintains the status quo (even when it’s unconscious) 
regardless of need. You wait while people do this anyway; why not find those who 
CAN become buyers (rather than ‘should’), facilitate their change quickly, and 
be there with them as they buy – and be with them as they figure out their own 
unique strategies for change – so long as you avoid trying to sell anything as 
they’re not buyers yet. <p>
Is it sales? No. It’s a Change Facilitation process I call Buying Facilitation®. 
By first enabling people to facilitate their buying decision path, you’ll have 
less competition, close more, stop wasting time selling to those who can never 
buy, and be true Servant Leaders; you can use your technology, your content 
marketing, your sales efforts as you are now, but with an additional focus.<h2>
WHY AREN’T THEY BUYING? SDM ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS</h2>
			<p>
Using the above thinking, here’s a ‘Q&amp;A’ to help you better understand why 
you’re getting the results you’re getting.<h4>
What’s wrong with seeking buyers to place our solutions? Isn’t that what sales 
is?</h4>
			<p>
Sales is perfect for finding and educating buyers with a need, but not for 
facilitating the buying decision path. There’s a 13 step decision path between 
recognition of a problem and a purchase. Sales only handles the limited portion 
(steps 10-13) that occurs once people reach the point where a purchase is their 
only option AND they have buy in from the full complement of stakeholders for 
non-disruptive change (step 9) (Think about it. You won’t buy a new car, or a 
new X, until you’ve tried to fix the one you’ve got, AND you have the funds now, 
AND your spouse/team agrees, AND you’ll still function as well with the new 
item.). No Outsider can make these determinations, they’re not based on buying 
anything, and your content is irrelevant until then.<p>
</p>
<h4>Why do they keep talking to me if they’re not going to buy?</h4>
			<p>
Until the entire scope of change is understood and integrated, people don’t 
understand the perimeters of their need (and when you ask biased questions, the 
flawed answers you receive often cause you to chase those who will never buy). 
Before becoming buyers, people must recognize that the cost of change (buying) 
is less than maintaining the status quo: their ‘system’ is sacrosanct. Would you 
buy a new car if your spouse would divorce you? Would you bring in a new CRM 
system if half of your user team would quit, or refuse to use it, or until the 
tech folks have the time to implement? You know you have to go to the gym more, 
and eat/drink less. You’ve got a need. Have you signed up for the gym? Stopped 
drinking beer? <h4>
Why are we still getting such a low close rate when we’ve got so many terrific 
tools at our disposal to introduce our features AND find the right demographic?</h4>
			<p>
Because only a small percent of people you focus on are buyers. Until they’re 
out of other options AND determined they must bring in something from outside 
AND have all of their internal ducks in a row, AND have buy-in (Buyer 
Readiness), your tools aren’t recognized.<h4>
Why do they keep talking to me if they’re not going to buy?</h4>
			<p>
During their change process, people research all possibilities. Your solution 
may be one of them; they’re actually using you for reference to report back to 
their team, or to figure out their own workarounds, or mention to their current 
vendor. It’s possible to know on the first call who will be a buyer and who is 
merely seeking data that will never lead to a purchase – but not with a 
solution-placement focus. <h4>
Why don’t buyers realize they need our solution when it seems so obvious?</h4>
			<p>
It’s only ‘obvious’ to you. The best content, the most relevant solution, will 
be ignored until they reach step 10 when they become buyers.<h4>
Why is the sales cycle so long when there is a solid need/solution match?</h4>
			<p>
The time people take to figure out how to manage change congruently is the 
length of the sales cycle. As Outsiders, we can never understand the depth of 
the change management issues: Who is fighting with who? What is the tech 
schedule? Who will need to be let go? How do internal politics show up? How does 
their history/future factor in? <p>
The system that holds the problem in place is much more powerful than any 
solution you can offer. They need buy-in from EVERYONE and EVERYTHING that 
created the status quo and will touch the new solution. You’ll never recognize 
“Joe from accounting” who is an unsung influencer, or the fight going on between 
the sales and marketing folks who need to share budget. It’s not about their 
need – until it is. And they can’t tell you because they don’t know, or they 
won’t have found the nut of the problem yet, or you’re asking the wrong 
questions biased by your need to sell.<h4>
Why do buyers make promises they don’t keep? Are all buyers liars?</h4>
			<p>
Buyers don’t lie. The one person you’re speaking with is responding to your 
biased questions, getting out of the thrust of your sales push, and is giving 
you the best data they’re willing to give you, or as much data as they have at 
that point in their 13 step change path. Whatever data they offer is limited by 
their access to the full Buying Decision Team, and the stage they’re at in their 
change management. You are, after all, strangers approaching them with a 
solution placement hat on, asking the wrong questions to the wrong people at the 
wrong time. As an Outsider you can never, ever have a clue as per the political, 
personal, strategic decision issues they face. But you can understand they 
system they decide in, a per your expertise in your field.<h4>
Why isn’t our great content being read or acted upon by the larger audience who 
really needs it?</h4>
			<p>
Needs it according to who? Your research? Your biased questions? Your focus on 
placing solutions limits your audience and keeps you from getting into the 
decision path earlier. Are they at the point of seeking workarounds? Is there a 
team buy-in problem? Have they forgotten to assemble some of the appropriate 
stakeholders? Are they finding a glitch (political, personal, management-based, 
etc.)? Your sales, marketing, content, and technology restricts your target 
market to the low hanging fruit who have clearly defined their need, know they 
cannot fix their own problem, and have a route to congruent change. <h4>
When I gather info about a need, and it seems obvious there is one, what am I 
missing?</h4>
			<p>
You’re merely asking biased questions to elicit the data YOU want to elicit from 
one person or a few research visits to your site, to find people who SEEM like 
they have a ‘need’ and spend a lot of resource chasing after them whether they 
are real buyers or not. Plus, because someone has a need doesn’t mean they are 
ready, willing, or able to buy; because the one person on the team you&#39;re 
speaking with does NOT seem to have a need, doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t have one. 
You’re a solution looking for a problem. Enter first with a Facilitator hat on, 
help those that CAN/WILL become buyers traverse the route to change, and THEN 
sell. <p>
It’s not as hard as you think. I developed a new form of unbiased question 
(Facilitative Question) to facilitate change (part of the Buying Facilitation® 
process) and pose these down the Pre-Sales steps to help the ‘right’ people 
become buyers. Here are two examples of responses to a Facilitative Question 
used on a first call. I bet you can tell which one CAN buy:<p class="quote">
SDM: How are you currently adding more tools and capability to your sales team 
for those times you seek to reach an expanded market?<p class="quote">
SALES DIRECTOR #1: I read a couple of sales books annually. If I like them, I’ll 
pass them on to my sales managers and tell them to get the sellers to read them, 
and run meetings to discuss their takeaways [Note: this was a real response.]<p class="quote">
SALES DIRECTOR #2: I’ve had a helluva time trying to find new tools to use. I’ve 
tried several, and keep getting the same results. I’d be glad to use something 
new if I could be assured it was really new, and it would work. <p>
My opening FQ, different for each situaltion, begins by shining a light on the 
system the person is operating in, and provides an invaluable insight into the 
state of possible change. It also begins making the person a Coach/Witness to 
her own status quo by asking for an overview of the system. This particular FQ 
helps #2 take an unbiased view of how she’s managed change until now. Buying 
Facilitation® then proceeds down her change steps so she can address each step 
efficiently, with me by her side. Director #1 had a need, but wasn’t a buyer.<h4>
When I form a wonderful relationship with a potential buyer with a need, where 
does he go? He seems to take calls and stay in touch, and then disappears. Where 
does he go?</h4>
			<p>
He was never a buyer. He either couldn’t get the buy-in from the Buying Decision 
Team (BDT), or came up with an alternative solution, or decided not to move 
forward because the cost of disruption was too high. He stays in touch as long 
as there is a possibility he needs to buy something (he hasn’t yet gotten team 
agreement or become a buyer), or so long as the data you’re offering is useful 
to their ultimate decisions. 80% of our prospective buyers will buy a solution 
similar to ours within 2 years of our connection. That means they had a need but 
couldn’t figure out how to congruently manage the change.<h4>
When I’m months into a sale, and everything that was going well suddenly stops, 
where did it go?</h4>
			<p>
See above. The person wasn’t really a buyer yet or the team wasn&#39;t bought-in to 
change.<h4>
Are buyers spending a lot of time trialing and speaking to other providers 
before they choose us?</h4>
			<p>
Possibly. People research the best alternatives to managing change with the 
least disruption.<h4>
Why aren’t we more successful when we check that they’ve brought in all 
stakeholders and help them achieve buy in? That’s managing Buyer Readiness, no?</h4>
			<p>
You’re an Outsider. You’ll never understand what’s going on; the questions you 
pose and the direction you offer are solution placement based; you listen with a 
biased ear, etc. (Seriously: Read Dirty Little Secrets then call me and I’ll 
teach you how to do it.) Did they bring in “Joe from accounting”? How are they 
managing the fight between sales and marketing? Oh - one other big reason: 
you’re merely speaking with one, at most two, people; you have no reach through 
the sales model to facilitate change. I can’t say this enough: you’re an 
Outsider.<p>
If you start as a Neutral Navigator, listen for systems and facilitate them 
through their OWN decisions with NO BIAS to selling, you can quickly find and 
serve those who WILL become buyers and help them efficiently manage change. 
Using Buying Facilitation® KPMG went from a 3 year sales cycle to a 4 month 
sales cycle with a $50,000,000 solution; Wachovia small business bankers went 
from a 2% close over 11 months to a 29% close over 3 months; Kaiser went from 
110 visits and 18 closed sales to 27 visits and 25 closed sales. By adding BF to 
their dummy terminals, Barclay’s helped customers define, and buy, the exact 
solutions they needed. Help them traverse their change path and sell to those 
who will buy.<h4>
Why don’t more people show up at appointments? Why are so many buyers reluctant 
to take appointments?</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>All of the stakeholders aren’t involved yet so they don’t even have a clear, 
complete description of ‘need’. Those who take appointments are doing research 
(and do WHAT? with your content) and haven&#39;t gotten team buy-in, or the full 
decision team isn&#39;t on board yet;</li>
				<li>They know from the first moment of a call that you’ll be pushing YOUR 
solution and not facilitating them in discovering THEIR own solution. It’s only 
if you can be an asset to them that they’ll be willing to see you.</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>
What’s wrong with trying to place a solution by ‘understanding need’, or 
creating a need, or selling? </h4>
				<p>
You can do that, for those who are already buyers understand their need.<h4>
I’ve paid a fortune for technology, research into demographics, opportunity 
management software, scripts, and experienced sales folks – but I’m still not 
closing all I deserve to close. Why?</h4>
				<p>
Because your efforts are focused on ‘buyer’ ‘need’, and neither of those 
necessarily correlate with buying anything for those who aren&#39;t yet buyers. 
				<h4>
How does Buying Facilitation® find, and close, more real buyers? </h4>
<p>Buying Facilitation® is a Change Facilitation model that works with sales 
(and coaching, etc.) and includes Facilitative Questions, Listening for Systems, 
Presumptive Summaries – wholly different skill sets than sales, and includes no 
bias. It traverses the first 9 steps of change management, in the ares your 
solution operates in, beginning with immediately ascertaining who is set up to 
be able to buy, or has a possibility of systemic change and then teaches them 
precisely how to discover their path to change. By adding BF you not only find 
the right buyers, but teach those who may not have been able to buy how to 
facilitate change. <p>
With Director #1 above, it would take so long to convince him that his plan was 
flawed, and then get the other managers who have complied with his plan to 
acceded to change, that it’s not worth the effort. BF progresses down the change 
steps and teaches them how to bring in the right people, discover if workarounds 
are worthwhile, and why they haven’t worked until now. Then it helps them 
determine how change would need to be addressed – and with BF you can do this on 
the first call. It will ignore the ones who will never buy, and help the real 
buyers be ready to buy. So much easier than finding those relative few who have 
already done this. And it’s much easier than it sounds: you’re just not used to 
it yet.<h2>
IN CONCLUSION</h2>
				<p>
Here is a rule: as long as the sales model tries to ‘find buyers’ and ‘place 
solutions’, you’ll never sell to anyone other than those who have determined 
they’re buyers, leaving you continuing to push your solution into their closed 
system. You can<ul>
					<li>discover who is, or will be, starting down the journey that will lead to a 
decision to purchase something, </li>
					<li>figure out, with a change management hat on, what the journey in your 
industry, and among your buying market, looks like (or call me and I’ll help),
					</li>
					<li>then enter with those few on their change journey as they quickly (with your 
help) figure out how to manage stakeholders, buy-in, workarounds, etc. and 
become buyers.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
By adding outreach, vocabulary, content, that first focuses on facilitating the 
buying decision path earlier you’ll enlarge your range of buyers by 5x. After 
all, people must do this anyway before becoming buyers; we might as well join 
them where they are and facilitate the right ones.<p>
Call me. Together, we can create content, software, scripts to find the right 
ones – those who WILL become buyers – and facilitate them down their decision 
path toward effective change and buying.<p>
