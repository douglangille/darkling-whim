How the Sales Industry Colludes in Failure</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would you consider a baseball player with a 95% failure rate Successful? Would 
you choose a surgeon with a 95% failure rate? Can you think of any field but 
sales, with an industry-standard close rate of 5%, that considers 95% failure 
‘Success’? Using targets, commissions, hiring, and profits based on a 5% close 
rate, the field of sales colludes in perpetuating the lie that failure is 
Success. Why hasn’t anyone ever said, “Gee. Maybe a 5% close rate is 95% 
failure. Maybe it’s a sign something’s wrong? Maybe it’s not a 
solution-placement / content / pitch / buyer / marketing / technology problem.” <p>
It’s possible to have much, much higher close rates. But that would demand the 
industry admit a problem. By colluding that a 5% close is industry standard – 
indeed, all that’s possible with the current Solution-Placement focus! – there’s 
no need to change. <h2>
THE MYTH OF SALES</h2>
<p>
When I began selling in 1979 the average close rate was 8%. Now, with our new 
electronic capability, sophisticated on-line marketing software, and ‘new new’ 
sales models, it’s down to 5%. Why? Because our current buying/selling 
environments are far more complex; consensus and change management are now 
necessary elements for buyer-readiness; and our Solution-Placement focus is 
designed to find only the 5% who are ready to buy. <p>
By starting at the end of a buyer’s decision process, hoping beyond hope to 
convince buyers they need our great solution, sellers get push back from a 
buyer’s good-enough-functioning system not equipped for change, and finding only 
those who have completed their comprehensive decision making – the low hanging 
fruit (5%). That’s right: Sales pushes and pitches, presents and proposes, hopes 
and waits, using activity developed to find the 5% who are ready. Sales has 
never questioned its assumption that 
<ul>
	<li>buyers will be persuaded by ‘good’ content that 
differentiates/explains/convinces of benefits;</li>
	<li>buyers will know what to do with our brilliant content;</li>
	<li>with good marketing and sales outreach, and a prospect with a need to match, 
we just need to find the button that will get them to buy. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
It’s never recognized that prospects can’t even hear what we’ve got to say or 
know how it’s relevant before determining their readiness to change and buying 
anything; it’s never mentioned that with all the marketing, all the outreach, 
all the never-ending attempts to &#39;get in’, nothing we’ve done for decades has 
significantly shifted our close rates. It’s because we’re pushing in from the 
back end and getting resistance, rather than entering at the beginning. More on 
this in a moment.<p>
Look at this this way: we’ve got nothing to sell if they’ve got nothing to buy, 
and doing what we’ve been doing hasn’t produced appreciably different results – 
and we can’t use the problem to fix the problem [Remember Einstein?]. The issue 
demands new thinking, new biases, new goals, and new skill sets. Let me share 
what I did to fix the problem with my tech start up in London in the 80s.<h2>
LEADING BUYER-READINESS</h2>
	<p>
Going from a sales person to an international entrepreneur, I recognized the low 
close rate problem as one of focus: sales focuses on placing solutions; buyers 
focus on solving (business) problems with minimal fallout. And since buyers can 
buy only when there is appropriate buy-in for change, management of fallout, and 
consensus among users (all steps necessary in some form regardless of the size 
or price of the solution), our efforts to find buyers or prospects is like 
seeking a needle in a haystack.<p>
I figured out a solution to help my sales teams enter buyer interactions as 
change facilitators who nurture buyer-readiness first: I developed Buying 
Facilitation® as a facilitation/leadership tool to help buyers recognize and 
achieve their most efficient change processes without biasing them or being 
purchase/product focused. We ended up with a 35% close rate (up from 9%) from 
first call, regardless of the size of the sale (all buyers/prospects go through 
some form of this, even if unconsciously). <p>
In 1987 I began teaching the model to clients, then left my business to teach 
the model full time to global corporate clients. Yet my results – all with 
control group studies – were largely ignored by the mainstream: I repeatedly 
came up against the collusion that perpetuates failure and the status quo, even 
in the face of obvious success. Here’s an overview of some of the resistance:
<p>
Working with Morgan Stanley in the 1990s, we achieved a 25% increase in one 
month over the control group. Follow on: the MD sent someone to Chicago to check 
on a man who purportedly had a similar buying-based model (turns out he didn’t). 
Why not just hire me to train everyone? Because I was a woman. He actually said 
that to the person he sent to Chicago.<p>
A group at William Blair &amp; Co. (brokerage house) went from a $400 million 
revenue to $1.3 billion in just under four years. Colleagues wondering how Jim 
achieved those spectacular numbers got a copy of my book Dirty Little Secrets 
from a carton he kept under his desk. Invariably they said the book was ‘Nuts’ 
and that Jim was just ‘lucky’. With a near-miraculous success happening before 
their eyes, this group preferred to devalue the results and continue failing 
rather than even trying to change.<p>
Working with Boston Scientific, we achieved a 53% increase over the control 
group. During the ‘Thank You’ call from my client, I asked if we’d be training 
the entire team. “No, the model is “too controversial.”<p>
Kaiser Permanente went from 110 visits and 18 closed sales (7% close rate) to 27 
visits and 25 closed sales (600% increase). They fired my client, saying that 
training their 1500 sales folks in the new material would create a major 
disruption; they disbanded and re-assigned the folks I trained so the new skills 
would be subsumed.<p>
Proctor and Gamble had a 15% increase in one month (huge in a behemoth company 
of this size). They said it would cost millions of dollars to change the systems 
that maintained their status quo – the manufacturing, delivery, billing, etc. 
all maintained a much slower sales cycle. They didn’t do further training.<p>
I could go on and on. Crazy stuff. Incontrovertible proof that adding different 
skills and shifting the focus closed more sales and wasted a lot less time (in 
vastly shortened sales cycle, creating more ready buyers, and early dismissal of 
those who would never buy). They’d prefer to maintain failure? Build and 
compensate sales forces on 4-6% close rates? Lose market share, hire 9x more 
sales staff with high turnover, pay more in training and travel? Yet the sales 
industry is doing what all systems do: eschew greater success to maintain ‘good 
enough’ and the ‘known’. That’s right. Like the sales industry, my clients 
preferred lower revenues than change.<h2>
HERE’S THE REAL DEAL</h2>
	<p>
Here are the underlying ‘givens’ that we ignore using the 
sales/Solution-Placement approach alone:<ul>
		<li>Buyers only buy when all of the idiosyncratic change management and people 
issues buy in and reach consensus. Buyers MUST do this anyway – with you or 
without you. It might as well be with you; you just need an additional skill as 
a sales is inadequate here. </li>
		<li>Buyers don’t want to buy anything; they just want to resolve a problem. 
They’ll buy something only when all else fails.</li>
		<li>Buyers buy using their own buying patterns, not a seller’s selling patterns. 
If the sales approach goes against the grain, buyers will choose a different 
vendor or solution.</li>
		<li>A buying decision is a change management problem: the Current State must shift 
in unknown ways to adopt something new, or face offending the entire system that 
will then resist. </li>
		<li>There is no way to ‘gather information’ from one person when it’s not clear 
that s/he is speaking on behalf of a complete Buying Decision Team who have 
determined how a solution would need to match their buying criteria (only a 
small part of which is a solution). </li>
		<li>Conventional information gathering is biased by the needs of the seller to 
ultimately place their solution and overlooks important data about decision 
making, buying patterns, group assembly. </li>
		<li>Buying involves a 13-step series of idiosyncratic, sequential, systemic, 
personal change decisions that an outsider can never be privy to but can 
facilitate. Selling and buying are confined to steps 10-13 and with that focus, 
there is no need for buyers to invite us in earlier. I’ve written extensively 
about this. www.dirtylittlesecretsbook.com</li>
		<li>The length of the sales cycle is the time it takes buyers to get buy-in for 
organizational, job, and personal change and fallout. It’s got nothing to do 
with a purchase, or a price tag, or even a need. Maintaining systems congruence 
is sacrosanct.</li>
		<li>When we get to an appointment to gather data and introduce ourselves, and only 
one or two people are present, we have no idea what stage of decision making 
they’re at or what they’ll do with our information after we’ve left. And we 
often pitch something the Buying Decision Team hasn’t agreed they need yet. Not 
to mention only those in steps 10-13 will see us and by then sellers are in a 
competitive situation.</li>
		<li>Making Step 1 ‘Getting the appointment’ discards about 40% of buyers who will 
buy once their change issues have been sorted out.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
Believe it or not, there is only one issue causing the entire set of problems 
above. Only one. Sales pushes solution data at the wrong time, starting at the 
end of the Buying Decision Path, and finds only that group, that person, that 
shows up at that time, with everyone else ignoring or resisting. You would never 
buy a computer without doing research, talking to friends to help you gather and 
recognize all necessary criteria. Lots of personal decisions. As a team member 
in a company, you would never bring in training without the team’s input, or an 
attempt to try to fix the problem on your own first, or talking to current 
vendors, or getting referrals from colleagues. Lots of group decisions. <p>
Research is showing the deterrent to sales success is our difficulty getting in 
to The Pre-Sales Process. While sales has attempted to resolve this issue by 
creating clever ways to get in from the outside (Buyer Personas being one) and 
is trying new tools to lead customers through to their buy cycle, it’s all 
taking place with a Solution-Placement bias. So long as the intent is to sell, 
an outsider will get resistance: there’s no way an outsider can ‘understand’ 
prospects during their change/decision/systems activities as they lie deep 
within the buyer’s culture. Before any purchase, buyers must figure out how to 
manage the resultant change and disruption congruently and until they do, theyre 
just not ready to attend to our needs to sell. <p>
But as outsiders, we can still understand how systems change and serve by 
helping prospects discover their own steps to Excellence; if what you’re selling 
matches their buying criteria once they’re ready (much more quickly than if they 
do this on their own), you’ve made a very quick sale with little competition. 
Think about it. You don’t buy the way you sell. The sales model is a solution 
placement model never meant to facilitate consensus, buyer readiness, or 
systemic change. <p>
It’s fixable once we stop colluding and perpetuating the myth of success; 
instead of redefining failure to convince ourselves that what we’re doing is 
optimal, let&#39;s just concede that what we’re doing is Failure and do something 
different. Put together a strategy to add some sort of 
leadership/coaching/consulting practice based on facilitating change (not based 
on manipulating a sale). Do this consistently in marketing and content, cold 
calls, prospecting, telemarking, presentation meetings, and your large sales. 
The question is: Do you want to sell? Or have someone buy? We need both for 
success; they each demand a different skill set. </p>
