How to Overcome the Fear of Public Speaking</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Payman Taei</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At one time in my life, like most people, I was terrified of public speaking.
</p>
<p>I remember one moment particularly clearly. My classmates were waiting for me 
to read a paper I’d written—an experience, I’m sure, many remember from high 
school and college. While a part of me was concerned about the views of my 
peers—I wouldn’t like to embarrass myself in front of them, after all—I was more 
concerned with what my professor would think. He was pretty strict, and I knew 
if I’d written something subpar he’d be the first to point it out. </p>
<p>Having dealt with anxiety for most of my life, I recognized the symptoms: 
pounding heart, cold sweat, this weird tingling down my arms and wrist, and the 
immense desire to run and hide back in my dorm. I think it might’ve been good 
the clock was behind me, or I would’ve been checking that constantly, rather 
than focusing on my audience. </p>
<p>Happily, however, one of my high school teachers gave me some helpful advice 
on overcoming a fear of public speaking—focus above people’s heads, rather than 
looking at their eyes. Needless to say, I survived the experience. </p>
<p>Public speaking terrifies a lot of people; in fact, for a long time it topped 
the list of personal fears, and is still rather high in the present day. If 
you’re scared of speaking in front of crowds, you’re in good company—even people 
like Gandhi and Abraham Lincoln tried to avoid public speaking for a long time.
</p>
<p>If you want to overcome these fears, then there are a lot of options you can 
use. Here are some useful tips and tricks that helped me, as well as many 
others. </p>
<h2>1. Practice, Practice, Practice </h2>
<p>Feeling like you don’t know your material is a major reason that people are 
afraid of public speaking. Naturally, the easiest method to fix this is to 
practice constantly. </p>
<p>Take the time to create your presentation on PowerPoint, sites like Visme, or 
on paper well in advance so you have time to tweak the information. Go over the 
work several times and get a feel for how it’ll flow when given to an audience.
</p>
<p>Creating questions you think the audience might ask—and then researching the 
answers—can help you further prepare. If you’ve researched and studied your 
topic well, you’re more likely to feel at ease once you start talking about your 
work. </p>
<p>On YouTube, Dr. Ivan Joseph illustrates how this method helped him. He stood in front of 
his mirror and practiced his speech to himself first, then to his family and 
peers. While he was nervous practicing in front of a crowd, the informal setting 
allowed him to hammer out his familiarity with his work in a safer setting. His 
nerves were gone by the time he had to speak to much larger crowds, since he’d 
already given the speech so many times. </p>
<p>For myself, I found making flashcards to practice from helped. I’d include 
small key notes, and then forced myself to try and remember and fill in the 
blanks. I kept them with me when it came time to speak, just in case I needed 
something to trigger a memory, but I’d already practiced the speech enough that 
I hardly used them. </p>
<h2>2. Find Something More Powerful Than Fear </h2>
<p></p>
<p>Fear can be a terrifying, all-consuming emotion—but so can many others. 
Speaking about something you’re passionate about can help drive the fear into a 
corner where it’s manageable. </p>
<p>Gandhi&#39;s fear was so severe that he 
struggled to even get out a few sentences in his younger years. What finally 
motivated him to overcome his fears of public speaking was the fact that he 
found something greater than himself that he felt he had to advocate—seeing 
India as an independent nation. </p>
<p>When you’re passionate about something, you’ve likely got a lot of facts down 
already, since you’ve probably done a lot of research on your own. Moreover, 
finding a topic you’re passionate about will make you more comfortable speaking 
on it. </p>
<p>Personally, I’ve found some of my best presentations involve something that I 
enjoy talking about. It makes the topic easier to research and present, and I 
feel less like I have to prove myself and more like I can focus on what I love. 
It helps build confidence in your topic. </p>
<p>Starting with a topic you’re comfortable with can help you prepare to deal 
with topics you might not know as well in the future. </p>
<h2>3. Think About How You Present<br>
</h2>
<p>What tricks have you already tried while giving a presentation? What do you 
typically do and tell yourself? These are all things to think about, because 
they can help make—or break—your mentality while speaking. </p>
<p>David Carbonell has a helpful suggestion: create a list of all the things you 
do and tell yourself while in front of a crowd. Take a few minutes just to write 
everything down then, at the end, go over what you’ve written. </p>
<p>Carbonell lists some common things people do when they fear speaking to an 
audience: avoiding looking at the audience, reminding yourself that it’ll be 
over soon, going through the speech as fast as possible, and other similar 
methods. However, these methods can actually make you more anxious—talking 
faster, for example, makes your breathing stilted, which resembles a fear 
response. </p>
<p>Carbonell’s suggestion? To accept the fact that you’re afraid, and face it 
head on. </p>
<p>Warren Buffett proves how successful this method can be. Buffett avoided 
anything to do with public speaking as much as possible—including a course on 
the subject, which he attempted to take but dropped out of. Eventually, however, 
he realized the only way to beat his fear was to face it, and enrolled in a 
course with similarly-scared people. </p>
<p>Brian Scudamore shares similar sentiments, saying, “What’s helpful is 
acknowledging that we get nervous because we care deeply about the audience and 
our message.” </p>
<p>Easier said than done. So what’s something you can do before the speech to 
prepare a little? Go back to the list. Create a new one of all the things you 
fear will happen during the speech, and then rationalize—why would someone say 
this? Is this really true? Encourage positive thoughts about yourself and your 
work, and think in calming terms: “It’s just a speech. It’s not a big deal. I’ve 
got this.” </p>
<h2>4. Relaxation Exercises </h2>
<p></p>
<p>Of course, if you’re a generally anxious person, it helps to find a way to 
actively relax and calm your nerves. </p>
<p>Brian Tracy has a particularly interesting method in the form of meditation. 
He notes that meditating for five minutes a day can help release stress and 
clear your mind. </p>
<p>A common trick is to take deep breaths. Doing this before giving a speech can 
help ground you; much like how rapid, sporadic breathing increases a fear 
response, a deep breath can simulate being in a relaxed situation. It can also 
help you take a step back from the moment and consider any fears with a more 
level head. </p>
<p>This can even help when actually giving a presentation. If you notice 
yourself speaking too quickly, you can pause and take a few deep breaths, then 
resume at a calmer pace. Pausing for one deep breath whenever you notice a fear 
response can help get you through a difficult patch and, once you know you can 
do it, it gives you the confidence that you can do it again, helping to allay 
some of the fears. </p>
<h2>5. Be Yourself </h2>
<p>Related to finding a topic you’re passionate about, probably the subject you 
understand best is, well, yourself. Speaking on personal experiences and your 
own feelings means there’s less research, and less chance that you’ll stumble 
and forget something. </p>
<p>Brian Scudamore talks about this in his article, as well, where he explains 
that one of his greatest speeches was given not on company practice, but on life 
lessons he’d learned from very personal experiences. He explains that this 
allowed him to connect to his audience better, something they recognized. </p>
<p>Being honest and simply speaking about your own experiences and beliefs can 
be terrifying, but also freeing. You don’t have to make anything up; you just 
say what you know. It can also give your presentations the most power. </p>
<p>Joel Osteen knows something of these struggles. When his father died, he was 
encouraged by his family to take the stage and preach. People often compared him 
to his father, bolstering his insecurities. </p>
<p>Osteen’s solution was, as mentioned above, to think about himself 
differently—not as someone “not as good” as his father, but as himself, and to 
find positive qualities about himself. </p>
<p>Relatedly, it can help to not focus so much on the audience and what they 
think. This is your presentation; the topic and your own experiences with it are 
what’s important, not what the audience thinks. Focus on your research and your 
feelings, and speak about them, blocking what the audience might think from your 
mind. </p>
<h2>What are Your Solutions? </h2>
<p>There are, of course, other methods you can use to overcome your fears. These 
are just a start. Experiment with these, or even new methods, and find out what 
works best for you. </p>
