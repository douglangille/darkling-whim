The Skills of Kindness: a guide for sellers, coaches, leaders and facilitators</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I believe our ultimate kindness is in helping Others be all they can be, to 
achieve their own brand of excellence that works best for their own unique 
system. But inadvertently and unwittingly we bias and restrict our interactions: 
Regardless of our message or willingness to truly serve, our own subjectivity 
may limit possibility. In this article I’ll explain why and how we fall short, 
and introduce new skills to enable us to truly serve Others.<h2>
WE CONNECT THROUGH OUR OWN SUBJECTIVITY</h2>
<p>
Here is how and why we restrict possibility:<p>
<b>Biased listening</b>: We each hear through subjective filters, created during, and 
restricting, our lives. To wit, with only biased, unconscious filters to work 
with (i.e. out of our control) our brains idiosyncratically interpret what 
Others mean to convey (although they may hear the words accurately). 
Unfortunately, we believe what our brains are hearing and sometimes have little 
way of knowing what we’re missing unless there’s a problem. As a result we make 
faulty assumptions, or are triggered to past experiences or habits. Not to 
mention potentially experiencing one of over 100 biases.<p>
I wasn’t fully aware of the extent of this (although on consideration, realized 
nothing else could be true) until I researched my book on how to hear others 
without bias. With the best will in the world we end up only accurately hearing, 
and thereby responding to, some percentage of what our Communication Partners (CPs) 
mean to share, regardless of our intent. It’s all outside of our conscious 
awareness. It’s necessary to listen using a different part of our brain (not 
Active Listening) that we’ve never been taught to use intentionally.<p class="quote">
Fact #1. We hear Others through our subjective biases and beliefs, causing us to 
misinterpret what’s been said.<p>
<b>Subjective expectations</b>: We enter into each conversation with expectations or 
goals (conscious or unconscious) of what we want from a conversation, thereby 
limiting outcomes to those within our set of expectations making it difficult to 
achieve all that’s possible.<p class="quote">
Fact #2. Entering conversations with goals or expectations (conscious or 
unconscious) unwittingly limits the outcome and full range of possibility, 
discovery, or creativity.<p>
<b>Restricted curiosity</b>: Our historic subjective associations, experiences, and 
internal references limit our ability to query or recognize complete fact 
patterns during data gathering or analysis. Our questions and support are often 
biased, assumptive, leading, habitual etc. thereby reducing outcomes to the 
limits of the Facilitator.<p class="quote">
Fact #3: We enable Others’ excellence, and our own needs for accurate data, to 
the extent we can overcome our own unconscious biases.<p>
<b>Cognitive Dissonance</b>: When the content we share – words, questions, information, 
education, advice, written material - goes against someone’s (conscious or 
unconscious) personal beliefs and system of Self, we cause Cognitive Dissonance 
and resistance regardless of the efficacy of the information. This is why 
relevant solutions in sales, marketing, coaching, implementations, doctor’s 
recommendations etc. often fall on deaf ears. We are unwittingly causing the 
very resistance we seek to avoid as we attempt to place perfectly good data into 
a closed system.<p class="quote">
Fact #4. Information doesn’t teach Others how to change behaviors.<p>
<b>Systems congruence</b>: Individuals and groups think, behave, and decide from a 
functioning and intricate system of beliefs and rules, history and experience, 
that creates and maintains their status quo. We know from systems theory that, 
because of the connections, it’s impossible to change only one piece of a system 
without effecting the whole. Also, we can never understand the ramifications of 
what any new ideas or solution would entail in an Other’s environment especially 
when every group, every person, believes it’s functioning well, Thank You Very 
Much. Outsiders offering solutions ‘foreign’ to the system and without the tools 
to teach the relevant parts of the system to make the appropriate changes, face 
resistance as the new solutions get rejected out of hand. Systems are willing to 
change only when there is buy-in from the relevant elements involved and a clear 
route to manage the change congruently - not merely because there appears to be 
a need, or we want to educate, or sell, or or or.<p class="quote">
Fact #5: Change cannot happen until there is a defined route to manage 
disruption, and the appropriate elements buy-in, for those elements that are 
disrupted.<p>
People or groups are unable to change, regardless of their need, or desire, for 
change, without somehow managing the implications any change causes to the 
status quo – all unknowable at the start, when change is considered. We all face 
a challenge accepting/using information offered by others who expect us to 
accept it. I face this with you, my readers.<p>
Most fields have been designed in a way that disregards this in their sales, 
marketing, leading, coaching, healing, etc., practices. Since conventional 
skills focus on placing the idea/solution/information, we haven’t been taught 
skills to manage the behind-the-scenes activity Others go through to handle 
their own internal change. All change must include this. When we merely enter at 
the end, we lose the opportunity to serve and facilitate, not to mention losing 
business, or having delayed sales cycles, or merely moderate success changing 
minds or behaviors. It’s possible to facilitate their journey in a systemic, 
unbiased way; we just need a few more skills. I’ve developed them.<h2>
THE SKILLS OF CHANGE</h2>
<p>
To enable expanded and managed choice, we must first facilitate Others in 
recognizing if they can congruently change their status quo (necessary for new 
decisions and change to occur). They may have buy-in issues down the line, or 
resource issues, or some host of issues. By focusing on facilitating 
choice/change first rather than pushing data, we teach Others to achieve 
internal, systemic congruence where possible and then join them with our 
solutions as appropriate. Otherwise, our great content will only connect with 
those folks whose beliefs systems already mirror the incoming data. In other 
words, when we Facilitate (sell, coach, lead, etc.) using our biased skills, we 
only help those who are biased in the same way. Unfortunately, those who most 
need us are the very folks who aren’t ready as their “good-enough/functioning” 
system is set up to continue as is.<p>
Simplistically, it’s a belief change problem. Beliefs form the foundation of who 
we are and inform our biases, our actions, what we hear, our goals, etc. Our 
beliefs convey who we are: they are largely unconscious, and represent our 
identity. Our behaviors are our beliefs in action. When we offer advice or 
information for new solutions, we are offering new “behaviors” without shifting 
the system that holds our underlying beliefs and behaviors in place and 
attempting to add something to the existent system that functions ‘well’ without 
it. There is no agreement or home for the new behaviors; our new solutions have 
no way to take hold, and the system resists.<p>
To facilitate change we must divest ourselves of bias and subjectivity and 
facilitate Others to first examine their web of (unconscious) beliefs, and then 
carefully manage any disruption to their system, before sharing our solutions. 
To accomplish this we must listen differently, ask entirely different questions, 
use the sequence that systems uses to change itself, and ensure there is buy-in 
at all the appropriate levels (stakeholders or personal).<p>
I’ve developed a generic model that gives Facilitators the skills to facilitate 
change at the belief and systems levels. Developed over 50 years, I’ve coded my 
own Asperger’s systemizing brain, refitted some of the constructs of NLP, coded 
the system and sequence of change, and applied some of the research in brain 
sciences to enable Left Brain evaluation and go beyond the pull of protection 
and bias to determine where/if/how new choices fit. In other words, I teach 
choice. Using it Others can consciously self-cue – normally an unconscious 
process – to enable and recognize the full range of choices possible and design 
change without resistance. I&#39;ve trained the model globally over the past 30 
years in sales, negotiation, marketing, patient relationships, leadership, 
coaching, etc.<p>
Below I introduce the main skills I’ve developed to enable change and choice – 
for me, the real kindness we have to offer. For those interested in learning 
more, I’m happy to chat, train, and share.<p>
<b>Observer</b>: to disconnect from bias on both ends, (Speaker and Responder), a 
non-associative state is necessary to help others accomplish conscious 
self-cueing, avoid bias, and see the full range of elements that make up the 
status quo. Associative state – Self (limited choice); Non-associative/witness 
state – Observer (full range of choice).<p>
<b>Listening for Systems</b>: from birth we’re taught to carefully listen for content 
(exemplified by Active Listening) which misses the underlying, unspoken system. 
This new type of listening hears in Observer, and enables hearing what’s meant, 
at the metamessage level, and supersedes all bias on either end.<p>
<b>Facilitative Questions</b>: conventional questions are biased by the Speaker and 
interpreted in a biased way by the Responder. Facilitative Questions (FQ) are 
not information focused. They are formulated in a specific order, with specific 
wording; move CPs into discovery via Observer; create a collaborative dialogue 
around congruent change in the area of the Facilitator’s solution (solution 
discussion comes much later). Conventional questions or data gathering cannot 
achieve this type of change facilitation. Here is a simple (out of sequence) 
example of the differences between conventional questions and FQs:<ol>
	<li><i>Conventional Question</i>: Why do you wear your hair like that? This question, 
meant to extract data for the Speaker’s use, is biased by the Speaker and limits 
choices within the Responder. Bias/Bias</li>
	<li><i>Facilitative Question</i>: How would you know if it were time to reconsider your 
hairstyle? While conventional questions ask/pull biased data, this question 
sequentially leads the Other through focused scans of unconscious beliefs in the 
status quo. Formulating them requires Listening for Systems.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
Using specific words, in a specific order, to stimulate specific thought 
categories, in specific areas within the system, FQs uncover systems issues the 
Other would need to handle prior to making any changes. Others usually do this 
sort of weighting, and deciding, and considering, etc. on their own but takes 
them longer. Now we can be part of the process with them much earlier in the 
path toward change.<p>
<b>Sequenced change</b>: Change occurs in a specific sequence. Until the Other can 
accurately (without bias) analyze their status quo (largely unconscious) to 
notice any unseen problems, get consensus from the appropriate people (not 
always obvious) needed if change were to occur, and understand how to recognize 
and manage any disruption (physical or mental/emotional) a proposed shift would 
incur, they can take no action or make any changes; their habitual functioning 
is at risk. Offering them our information is the final thing they’ll need when, 
or if, all of the systemic change elements are managed. <p>
There is no way to enable change by starting with attempts to offer/gather 
information, successful only when the Other has already accomplished all of the 
above – unlikely in sales, coaching, implementation, or leadership where we fail 
by pushing the ‘end’ too soon and face resistance when the system goes into 
self-preservation. We are indeed limiting all of our interactions to helping 
only those who are entirely set up to change (the low hanging fruit), and 
failing with those who might need us but aren’t quite ready. We can help them 
get themselves ready.<h2>
THE SKILLS OF KINDNESS</h2>
	<p>
Using my Buying Facilitation® model (The term &#39;buying&#39; doesn&#39;t relate to sales. 
It&#39;s a generic model.) Facilitators can lead Others through 
	<ul>
		<li>an examination of their unconscious beliefs and established systems</li>
		<li>to discover blocks, incongruences, and endemic obstructions,</li>
		<li>to examine how, if, why, when they might need to change, and then
		</li>
		<li>help them set up the steps and means (tactically) to make those changes</li>
		<li>in a way that avoids system’s dysfunction</li>
		<li>with buy-in, consensus, and no resistance.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
Being kind means helping Others be all they can be THEIR way, not OUR way. 
Whenever we attempt to push our own agenda – regardless of the need or possible 
outcome – we are being manipulative, self-serving, selfish, etc, and we’re 
missing the larger picture. We can be true servant leaders and change agents to 
facilitate real, lasting change.<p>
There are a lot of ways to be kind. I believe that those of us that have 
something important to share that would truly serve others need the skills to 
enable Others to hear us. Instead of pushing our great ideas into people-systems 
that don’t know how to listen or adopt, let’s use these new skills to facilitate 
real change and then, when Others know how to change congruently, our important 
solutions will be heard.</p>
