Sales, Marketing and Social Can Be More Successful: hint - it&#39;s not about 
your content</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sales, marketing, and social marketing attempt to place solutions and create 
relationships by supplying great content, discovering likely prospects, and 
creating trust. Unfortunately sellers end up closing a small fraction – less 
than 5% - of those they reach, and marketers and social end up closing even 
less. Our products are terrific. So what’s causing our failure? </p><h2>
PROBLEMS WITH OUR CURRENT THINKING</h2>
<p>
Here’s a bit of flawed thinking that exacerbates the problems:<ul>
	<li>Sellers believe prospects are folks who SHOULD buy (those with a ‘need’) 
rather than those who WILL buy (those who achieve consensus and set up a way to 
manage any change a purchase involves, and are ready and able to buy regardless 
of urgency of need). </li>
	<li>Marketers believe that content is king, that offering the right content at the 
right time enables a buying decision. But we don’t know the role the reader 
plays on the Buying Decision Team, how or when our content is being used, and if 
it’s making a difference in the buying decision (i.e. it might be just a 
resource);</li>
	<li>Social believes that by engaging in relationships over time and developing 
trust, followers will come back when they are ready. But because we can’t know 
their decision path, or associates who need to buy-in to any change, or internal 
political issues, we can’t know if we are spending time wisely.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
We can facilitate buying decisions by employing different thinking to avoid<ol>
		<li>Merely guessing at, or manipulating, our conversations or offerings without 
knowing where along their decision path our buyers are, and how many of their 
Buying Decision Team are on board;</li>
		<li>Playing a numbers game to find and pitch those with a supposed ‘need’, 
assuming our content persuades buyers to buy or take action;</li>
		<li>Neglecting possible actions that can facilitate a buyer’s off-line decision 
steps.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
It’s time to add some new thinking to what we’re doing.<h2>
WHAT I LEARNED IN THE TRENCHES</h2>
		<p>
By focusing on placing solutions, we’re missing the first 9 specific steps in a 
13 step buying decision path that have nothing to do with our solution:<ul>
			<li>People have complicated issues (personal, systemic, organizational, and all 
criteria-based) to handle before they can buy or change. They only buy when all 
issues are managed regardless of need (systems congruence trumps need);</li>
			<li>Buying includes change; change means disruption; consensus helps manage the 
disruption before it’s a problem; each person involved brings unique criteria 
and voice and shifts the buying criteria (i.e. until the entire Buying Decision 
Team is formed, weighs in, and agrees, there is no way to accurately define 
‘needs’).</li>
			<li>Given politics, internal relationship issues, history and future, it’s 
challenging, but necessary, to design a route through to change (in this case a 
purchase) that includes the people, rules, relationships, and group outcomes to 
avoid resistance and fallout.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
I learned this as both a sales person and an entrepreneur. When Merrill Lynch 
hired me a stockbroker in the 1970s, I became a million-dollar producer my first 
year. But I couldn’t figure out why everyone with a need (especially those I had 
a great relationship with) didn’t always buy what I thought they needed. Where 
did they go?<p>
When I started up my tech company in London in the 80s I realized the problem: 
as a buyer myself, my direct needs were often superseded by the social, 
political, organizational, and relational considerations I had to manage. When 
sellers came to pitch they worked hard to understand my needs in the area their 
solution served, and gave fine pitches, but as outsiders had no way to handle or 
understand the fights I was having with the Board, or the issues the distributor 
was having with their sales force. Nor did anyone even try.<p>
The sales model, I realized when faced with great pitches and lovely sales 
folks, was not designed facilitate the behind-the-scenes non-need-related issues 
I had to manage before I could buy anything. I realized that all the great 
content, all the lovely relationships, all the ‘needs’ I had that matched their 
solutions, were worthless if I couldn’t manage the off-line, ‘Pre Sales’ issues 
that would be involved if I purchased anything. So, “Yes” to need; “No” to Buyer 
Readiness. And the sales model has no skills that address this problem because 
it is personal, idiosyncratic, and systems-based, and lie outside of the focus 
of placing solutions. I’ve heard it said that 80% of buyers you’re following now 
will buy a similar product (not yours) within 2 years of your connection; that’s 
the time it took them to make decisions that wouldn’t disrupt – the time of the 
sales cycle.<p>
I then developed a facilitation approach (Buying Facilitation®) for my own sales 
team to add to the front end of the sales model to first facilitate Buyer 
Readiness – the steps buyers would have to take internally anyway and without 
Buying Facilitation® take a helluva lot longer. My team then added a new focus, 
and entered conversations as change management facilitators first, then selling 
when/if buyers were ready (more were ready, and much, much quicker, with no 
chasing around and we were able to disengage very early from those who could 
never buy.). After all, until they were able to determine if they COULD buy (and 
still maintain systems congruence) they could never be buyers regardless of need 
(the reason folks with a real need don’t buy). I continue to pose this question: 
do you want to sell? Or have someone buy? They are two different activities, and 
the sales model only handles the sales end; the buying end is change management.
<p>
Rule: the time it takes buyers to manage their off-line, idiosyncratic change 
issues is the length of the sales cycle. We were then able to get onto the 
Buying Decision Team early, lead buyers quickly through their unique decisions, 
and became great relationship managers, not to mention servant leaders. Our 
sales tripled and the time to close was reduced by two thirds; our relationships 
with clients were cemented and we avoided competition and price issues.<p>
The takeaway here for marketers and social is the recognition that we are 
largely ignoring the hidden, systemic issues going on within our buyers’ 
environments that are not available to outsiders yet fundamental for any change 
to happen. We keep pushing content, hoping and praying that it will reach the 
right people at the right time. So long as we continue to focus on solution 
placement, we lose sales that we needn’t. That is our Achilles Heel. And it 
doesn’t have to be.<h2>
WHAT’S THE ROLE OF CHANGE MANAGEMENT?</h2>
			<p>
Buyers and followers don’t know their journey to change when they begin and 
hence take longer than necessary to figure it out. But figure it out they must. 
And we can help them, and make our value proposition our ability to be their 
GPS, so long as our focus is to facilitate change, not push or manipulate to 
make a sale. Plus, it’s an entirely different skill set.<p>
There are two elements of Buying Facilitation® that can be added to create a 
‘pull’ that’s change- and decision-focused.<ol>
				<li>Enter as a change facilitator. Instead of coding, noticing, tracking details 
that will help us guess at who’s reading, who’s a decision maker, where they 
might be in their sales cycle, etc. let’s begin listening for, and designing, 
tools that facilitate each step of the movement along the decision path that 
change decisions goes through; let’s ensure they discover the right people to be 
involved (some not so obvious) and help them build the necessary internal 
consensus. Currently we now listen for what we want to hear rather than 
listening for issues with decision making, change or choice. I’ve developed a 
new way to listen (Listening for Systems) that is non-biased.</li>
				<li>Guide buyers through change management at the start of the sales process. 
Regardless of the type or size of the solution, buyers cannot buy until they are 
ready internally, and sales doesn’t have tools to focus to handle systemic 
change management without bias. Facilitative Questions are a type of 
criteria-recognition tool that facilitates thinking using Servant Leader 
thinking. Conventional questions are biased in favor of the seller; Facilitative 
Questions are biased in favor of the buyer.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
It’s possible to develop assessments, questionnaires, intelligent contact 
sheets, CRM tools that enter in the right place along the decision path, provide 
the capability to lead buyers and followers through the full complement of steps 
they must take, making it possible to send out just the appropriate data at the 
right point in the cycle, and facilitate the consensus and buy-in asthey quickly 
ready themselves for change. We can add these to the sales, marketing, and 
social models to truly serve our buyers and followers and close more. It will be 
an addition, and the results will stronger relationships and more conversions.<p>
The problem has never been your solution; the problem is that we overlook the 
idiosyncratic stages of Buyer Readiness that are not involved with using our 
solutions – helping buyers address their unknowable change issues (independent 
of need, and based on people, rules, relationships, history, etc.) so they can 
get their ducks in a row to buy anything. By adding a facilitation tool directed 
at managing change before we try to sell, we can find more clients, and sell 
more, faster. And we can become true servant leaders.</p>
