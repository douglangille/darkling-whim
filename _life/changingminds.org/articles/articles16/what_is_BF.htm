What is Buying Facilitation(R)? What sales problem does it solve?</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>BIG IDEA</b>: <b>Buyers can’t buy until they’ve handled all of their internal stuff</b> 
and everyone involved agrees they’re ready, willing, and able to bring in 
something new. With a solution-placement focus, sales and marketing limit us to 
finding only those who have completed those tasks and deem themselves ready to 
engage – the low hanging fruit.<p>
<b>PROBLEM</b>: <b>The problem is not in getting our solution sold</b>; it’s in getting our 
solution bought. Buyers have Pre-Sales work to do that doesn’t involve the 
content we spend a lot of resource trying to push on them. Our sales and 
marketing efforts are set to seek ways to ‘get in’, get read, or determine 
&#39;need&#39;, ignoring the buyer’s need to figure out how to do their real change 
work: to assemble the most appropriate people, get consensus, try workarounds, 
and manage change. Because of the selling biases in our listening and 
questioning, we extract partial data, from people who don’t have the full fact 
pattern yet; promised dates get ignored; people disappear; there is no buy-in. 
We waste our time pushing content and waiting, hoping they’ll buy, instead of 
entering earlier to facilitate the change with them.<p>
<b>PROBLEM</b>: <b>The flaw in the sales model</b>: designed to place solutions, sales starts 
selling before buyers are ready/able to buy, restricting success to those who 
deem themselves ready- the low hanging fruit (5%). Indeed, buyers don’t want to 
buy anything: they just want to solve a (business) problem with the least 
disruption.<p>
<b>PROBLEM</b>: <b>The status quo is preferred and is the basis of decision making</b>. 
Regardless of a buyer’s real need, or the relevance of our solution; regardless 
of relationship or pitch/content/price; it is only when there is buy-in for 
systemic change, and an action plan that manages disruption, will buyers 
investigate the most agreeable solution. This holds true regardless of type or 
price of solution.<p>
<b>SOLUTION</b>: <b>Buying Facilitation(R) is a unique consulting model that facilitates 
change and decision making</b>. Used with the sales model, it enters the buyer&#39;s 
buying decision process to facilitate excellence, teaching buyers how to manage 
all the systems/change stuff they must do: recognize and manage all of the 
back-end, idiosyncratic, internal issues they must address before they can 
consider a change in the area our solution can help in (i.e. you’re not helping 
them determine if they need new software if you sell leadership training.). It 
can be used with small personal products, cold calls, help desks, complex sales, 
and marketing.<p>
A non-biased change management model, BF uses a new form of listening (Listening 
for Systems) and a new form of direction-driven/non-biased question 
(Facilitative Question) to facilitate our buyer’s journey through the steps of 
change only they can make – change that would include our solution for those 
ready. Once BF has supported buyers through the steps of their decision making, 
we are already in place, on their team. Makes it much easier to sell.<p>
A buying decision is a change management problem. Buyers must handle stuff, with 
us or without us: we’ve always sat and waited (and called, sent, called, 
pitched, prayed, waited) while they do this themselves. If we can collaborate 
with them as consultants (change facilitators, not solution providers – and this 
is an important distinction), we’ll serve them from the beginning, making the 
process more efficient for those who are the real prospects, eliminating the 
rest immediately, and being on board when they’re ready. [Read my book on this: 
www.dirtylittlesecretsbook.com]<h2>
CASE STUDY USING BUYING FACILITATION(R)</h2>
<p>
Let me lead you through one simple case study from a group of small business 
bankers I trained for one of the 3 major US banks. Their numbers after the 
training were quite impressive compared to the control group:<p class="quote">
A. Control group Sales: 100 calls, 10 appointments, 2 closed sales in 11 months.
<p class="quote">
B. Buying Facilitation(R): 100 calls, 37 appointments, 29 closed sales in 3 
months.<p>
While this might sound high, remember: interactions proceed differently using 
Buying Facilitation® because the focus isn’t to sell/push product/find a buyer 
(A) but to facilitate the entire buying decision path (B). We began immediately 
by helping them determine how they’d add a resource such as ours when they 
needed it:<p class="quote">
“Hi. My name is John and I’m a small business banker from X bank. This is a 
sales call. I’m wondering: How are you currently adding new banking resources 
for those times your current bank can’t give you what you need to keep your 
business operating optimally?”<p>
Here’s the thinking: Given all small businesses have some banking relationship, 
the only businesses who would want to meet to discuss new banking services were; 
1. those who weren’t happy with their current bank, or 2. had bankers who might 
not be able to provide what they might need. Attempting to get an appointment 
because ‘we want to understand your needs’ or ‘show you our new solutions’ etc. 
to prove we’re “better&quot;, or to try to convince them to change suppliers, meant 
we would seem to be attacking their current vendors and current relationships. 
Not to mention pitching into a closed environment, leaving us hoping that the 
spaghetti would stick somewhere. That approach got a 90% refusal to even meet. 
Nope. No need to meet. We’ve got a bank, thank you.<p>
By focusing on helping them determine how they’d manage if they needed more than 
their current providers could supply, and by helping them figure out where they 
could add a new resource without disrupting current working relationships, we 
vastly expanded the field of possible buyers and instantly eliminated those who 
would never buy. It proved a winning tactic: 37 made appointments just from that 
opening question (up from 10). During the field visit we helped them get buy-in 
and consensus to bring in an additional vendor – us. Win/win. Collaboration. 
True facilitation.<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>: Buying Facilitation(R) is not sales, not a solution placement tool, 
not an information gathering tool, and not a persuasion tactic. It’s not 
content-driven, and sellers don’t try to understand a buyer’s needs until the 
time when the buyers 1. have the complete set of ‘givens’ they need in order to 
consider all of the elements of change (including, but not limited to, buying 
something); 2. are ready to adapt to change and there is consensus. There’s no 
manipulation, no persuasion, no influencing. It’s a win/win collaboration, 
servant leader model: we actually facilitate buyer readiness. I can’t say this 
enough: buyers go through this anyway, without us. We can push stuff at them 
while we wait for them to show up, or we can facilitate them through the length 
of it. It can be your competitive edge.<p>
We can teach people how to change/buy; we can shorten the time to buy by making 
their change process efficient; we are helping them determine how, and when, 
they need us. It’s a facilitation, not a push. And we end up with real prospects 
who we’ve helped get ready to buy. Not to mention the collaboration, trust, 
respect, and integrity built into the interaction creates lasting relationships 
when used throughout the relationship.<p>
The good news is that you can still sell – but use your time to sell to those 
who are indeed ready willing and able, rather than waste 90% of your time trying 
to manipulate, pitch, persuade, push, ‘get through the door’, network, write 
content, etc. You can help those who CAN buy get their ducks in a row and 
quickly eliminate those who will never buy because it will become obvious to you 
both. I’m not suggesting you don’t sell; I’m merely suggesting you spend your 
selling time only on those who WILL buy, and set that up by first facilitating 
prospective buyers down their own buying decision path.<p>
