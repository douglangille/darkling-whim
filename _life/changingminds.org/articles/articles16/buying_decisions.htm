Buying Decisions, Buying Decision Path, Buy Cycles, and Pre-Sales</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I’d like to set the record straight. In 1985 I coined terms that I&#39;ve written 
extensively about in best selling books, magazines, and hundreds of articles. 
Unfortunately, when finally adopting them, the sales field defined them 
differently than originally intended, causing important concepts to be lost. 
This article presents the intended definitions and explains how I came to coin 
the terms.<p>
In 1979 I became Rookie (stockbroker) of the Year at Merrill Lynch with 210 
accounts (the market was 777). I couldn’t understand why prospects who ‘should 
have’ bought didn’t buy. When I started up a tech company in London in 1983 and 
became a ‘buyer’ I realized the problem and developed a new skill set to migrate 
it. Here&#39;s how I figured it out. <h2>
HOW SALES IGNORES BEHIND-THE-SCENES BUYER’S REAL ISSUES</h2>
<p>
As an entrepreneur with needs, I invited sellers in to pitch me. But regardless 
of their professional skills or my potential need, I couldn’t decide what or if 
to buy before<ul>
	<li>the people involved shared their thoughts and concerns, and bought-in to any 
changes a new solution would involve, </li>
	<li>we discerned any fallout to the company, relationships, people, policies etc. 
that change would incur and figure out ways to minimize it</li>
	<li>we tried workarounds and determined we couldn’t fix the problems with known 
resources. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
Even though we were only a $5,000,000 company, I had a closely knit team and 
flourishing business to consider before bringing in anything that might rock the 
boat with my employees, investors, clients, company strategy, bottom line, 
brand, daily routines and systems. With a focus on placing solutions and 
‘understanding’ needs (impossible to answer accurately until we all comprehended 
the scope of the givens) the sellers pitched solution data I didn’t know how to 
consider responsibly and potentially lost me as a buyer. That’s when I realized 
the problem I had had with buyers not closing:<p>
The sales model focuses on placing solutions (seeking folks with a ‘need’ who 
‘should’ buy) and ignores the confounding human-, policy-, and system-specific 
issues buyers must handle before a purchase could even be considered (folks who 
‘will’ buy). By entering only during the final element of choice (vendor, 
solution), sellers squander the ability to influence the major portion of a 
buyer’s decision process which has little to do with needs or purchase.<p>
Indeed, the sales model promotes the cart before prospects even know if they 
have a horse or have mapped out a destination, ensuring only those who have 
their cart ready to go (knew the obstructions, route alternatives, and danger 
signs) would buy. Promoting solutions, and asking questions in service of a 
sale, merely captures the low hanging fruit – those ready, willing, and able to 
buy – and ignores the possibility of influencing, enabling, and serving the 
early, Pre-Sales components in the decision-making path (whether 
selling/marketing online or through customer contact) - not to mention loses 
untold amount of business.<p>
I realized all buyers must do this; and as I seller I had been sitting and 
waiting while buyers did this on their own, without me. Indeed, the time it took 
them to complete this was the length of the sales cycle. I figured if I could 
facilitate the buyer&#39;s decision path, I could accelerate their decisions to 
‘buy’ or ‘not buy’, stop wasting time, close more sales (quickly) and really 
serve. So I coded the entire change/decision arc (13 Steps, 9 of which [70% of 
the decision process] are outside the scope of how/what we sell), learned how 
systems make decisions to change, coined some new terms and developed some new 
models for questioning and listening without bias, and built this into a front 
end to sales so I could enter, facilitate/serve, and influence, earlier. I named 
this process Buying Facilitation® to denote the difference in focus between 
‘selling’ and ‘buying’ and help buyers do the initial stuff they had to do 
anyway, but without sellers:<ul>
		<li>assemble all appropriate stakeholders ((Buying Decision Team) to get their 
input; </li>
		<li>get consensus for types and levels of change manageable; </li>
		<li>research options;</li>
		<li>discover easy, economical workarounds where possible; </li>
		<li>decide how to identify handle any disruption a new addition would cause;
		</li>
		<li>weight risks with stakeholders to discern the efficacy of buying anything (Buy 
Cycle); </li>
		<li>choose solutions and vendors.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
To be fair, the sales job has never been about facilitating change, using a 
restrictive ‘solution-placement’ model since its inception without recognizing 
the low close and enormous time wastage is anything more than a problem finding 
buyers. This singular focus has been so endemic that sales hasn’t accounted for 
either the idiosyncratic issues buyers must address prior to buying anything 
(even for inexpensive items) or the opportunity to influence and serve buyers 
much earlier than the final point they might reach to buy, believing that if 
they find creative ways to offer content earlier it will mitigate the problem. 
But it doesn&#39;t.<p>
The industry close rate of 4% has always been an indication of a problem: the 
centuries-old bias toward placing solutions (How can we accept a 96% failure 
rate [from first contact] as standard?) ensures all sales models, including 
Challenger, create resistance, potentially turn off real buyers who need your 
solution (80% of prospects buy a similar product within 2 years of your 
interaction), and ignore the ability to influence 70% of the Buying Decision 
Path.<p>
Indeed, buyers don’t want to buy anything, they just want to resolve a problem 
congruently, without major disruption to that which works well. Indeed a 
purchase happens only when there is no alternate resolution; and we haven’t had 
a skill set that blends with the sales model to help: except for visionary areas 
within the global companies I’ve trained over the last 30 years, the sales field 
found my ideas and newly coined terms pointless. But sellers who added Buying 
Facilitation® to their sales activities experience upward of a 6x increase in 
sales as they truly facilitate buying decisions. My dream has always been that 
Buying Facilitation® be taught as part of sales training for all sales 
professionals. <h2>
BUYING FACILITATION® FACILITATES 70% OF BUYER’S DECISIONS</h2>
		<p>
I taught my sales team how to add Buying Facilitation® to their current sales 
skills; we quickly experienced a 40% increase in sales (from first call) and I 
only needed half the sales staff. My tech team used the material to involve all 
the right people immediately and extract the most vital information quickly, 
making programming and implementing more efficient, and insuring early project 
completion and no ‘user errors’. I began teaching the material to clients, 
coaches, and managers.<p>
Approximately five years ago my terms began entering the sales field. But, as 
happens when a new idea enters mainstream, the terms were not defined as I 
defined them, but re-defined to be a part of the very concepts I was fighting 
against.<h2>
TERMS DEFINED</h2>
		<p>
I have no illusions that the mis-definitions will continue and some mainstream 
sellers will think they ‘do this’ already. Hopefully some folks will seek to 
learn the material (and training is required as the model employs entirely 
different thinking and skills). But just for my own piece of mind, I’m offering 
the definitions of the terms I coined in 1985. They include some form of the 
word ‘buy’ to denote the disparity between the act of buying and the process of 
selling. And the underlying belief is that as sellers we should be using our 
unique positions as corporate representatives and knowledge experts to be 
servant leaders and truly serve buyers to discover their own path to excellence, 
hopefully, ultimately, with our solution (But if not, we end quickly and gently. 
Otherwise, we close in half the time.).<p class="quote">
<b>Buying Facilitation®</b>. A generic change management model for coaches, sellers, 
managers, etc.) that enables efficient, congruent change, that employs a 
specific type of listening (Listening for Systems), and new form of question 
(Facilitative Questions – not information gathering), used in a specific, coded 
sequence, for facilitators to enable excellence through congruent change. It 
manages all of the unconscious, upfront, endemic change issues that would have 
to accede for change to happen. Until buyers (or anyone) know how to manage 
this, they cannot agree to change/buy, hence the length of the current sales 
cycle.<p class="quote">
<b>Helping Buyers Buy</b>. The term comes from the first Buying Facilitation® training 
I delivered in 1988 to KLM. By ‘helping buyers buy’ we facilitate the full 
Pre-Sales Buying Decision Path.<p class="quote">
<b>Buying Decisions/Process</b>. The outcome of resolving all of the change/decision 
issues into an action: consensus of all stakeholders who will touch the new 
solution; the route forward to change without disruption or resistance; deciding 
to move beyond their workaround; AND THEN the solution/vendor choice issues. The 
term is being misdefined by sales to merely include vendor/solution choice 
issues.<p class="quote">
<b>Buying Decision Path</b>. 13 steps that traverse the elements of change management: 
starting with an idea (Step 1) through to a purchase (Step 13). It includes 
people, systems, implementation, resistance, workarounds, relationships – and 
comes well before any decision is made to buy anything, and quite separate from 
any ‘need’. The sales field uses this term erroneously to denote how buyers 
choose one vendor/solution over another, line up the funds, etc. – a usage 
dynamically opposite to the original definition.<p class="quote">
<b>Buy Cycle</b>. The entire set of givens necessary for buyers to end up with 
excellence (either internally or with a purchase). Again, it’s not only the 
solution/vendor choice issues.<p class="quote">
<b>Buying Decision Team</b>. The full set of stakeholders – some not obvious, some not 
‘decision makers’ – who will touch the final solution and need to add their 
ideas, concerns, knowledge, and feelings to the discussion. Usually sellers (or 
change agents) aren’t privy to the internal machinations necessary before a 
purchase (or any change) can happen. Hence the 4% close rate.<p class="quote">
<b>Buying Patterns</b>. The way the buyer has traditionally bought/changed in the past. 
Do they always use known vendors? Will they never take cold calls or meetings 
with sellers? Sellers traditionally use their comfortable selling patterns and 
cannot connect with buyers with divergent buying patterns.<p>
Marketers currently use the term Buyer Persona to denote ‘influencers’ who will 
enable a sale. This ignores most of the early decisions buyers make and keeps 
marketing from entering effectively much earlier. Using different types of 
content it’s quite possible to influence different points along the Buying 
Decision Path.<h2>
TIME FOR CHANGE</h2>
		<p>
Think about it. Are you happy with your low close rate? Your horrific waste of 
time and resource running around after people who will never buy (and who you 
could know on the first call weren’t buyers) or responding to RFPs that fail? 
The time waste seeking prospects who will take an appointment only to have one 
person on a data gathering mission show up – and then you never hear from them 
again (not to mention the hours planning for the meeting!)? Have you never 
wondered where buyers go when YOU think they have a need?<p>
The current sales model closes a fraction of people who need your solution, and 
costs much more than necessary on wasted resources (large sales forces, 
presentations, proposals). The problem isn’t finding the buyers; the problem is 
facilitating those who can buy. As an example, using Buying Facilitation® at 
Kaiser, sellers went from 110 visits and 18 closed sales in a month, to 27 
visits and 25 closed sales, an increase of 600%, not to mention the time saving.<p>
I go back to the original question I posed decades ago: Do you want to sell? Or 
have someone buy? They are two different activities. And I’ve developed terms 
that help sellers think through the steps that help buyers buy. Maybe it’s time 
to begin learning the ‘how’ of helping buyers buy, the ‘what’ of the buying 
decision path, and the ‘who’ of the buying decision team. Let’s begin using the 
terms properly and stop ignoring such a large piece of the puzzle.</p>
