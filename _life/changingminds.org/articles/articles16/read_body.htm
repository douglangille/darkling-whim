The Importance of Learning Body Language for the Younger Generation</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Guido Croce</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Let me ask you something. Imagine you are trying to solve a mathematical 
problem and it is given to you two options: </p>
<p class="quote">Option 1: you can solve it by using only half of your brain capabilities. </p>
<p class="quote">Option 2: you can solve it using the totality of your brain&#39;s power, but you 
have to learn a few simple concepts beforehand. </p>
<p>You would most likely choose Option 2, right? If you didn’t have to learn too much to be able to use your brain&#39;s full 
capacity you would probably go that route. What if I told you that you are not using 100% of your reading capabilities 
when interacting with people? Surprisingly enough, most people are in that category, being clueless of what 
other people are thinking. </p>
<h2>What You&#39;ll Learn </h2>
<p>So, in this article I am going to show you: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Why and How Important is it for the younger generation to learn body 
language (ex: high school or university graduates)</li>
	<li>The One Simple Method I use to read people</li>
	<li>2 Body Language Mistakes to Avoid </li>
</ul>
<p>I want to share this information with everyone to not only be able to help 
them read people but also improve their own image. That is the mission of my 
website www.simplebodylanguage.com.<br>
</p>
<h2>Reality and Benefits of the World of Body Language </h2>
<p>Nowadays, after graduating from high school, college or university, it&#39;s 
harder than ever to get a job, and learned skills is what differentiates us from 
the next guy/girl, when applying for a job. Although being able to read people is not actually something you can get a 
certificate for, it will help you reach a new level of communication with other 
humans. </p>
<p>Let&#39;s see a few applicable benefits of learning Body Language: </p>
<ul>
	<li>You&#39;ll become more charismatic</li>
	<li>You&#39;ll learn social cues, thus having better conversation</li>
	<li>You&#39;ll be able to know what somebody is thinking </li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#39;s see a few examples of where you could benefit from knowing body 
language and non-verbal communication. </p>
<h3>Example 1: New Friends? </h3>
<p>Imagine yourself in a bar and you just met a group of people. It seems to you 
that they like you and want to keep talking to you. </p>
<p></p>
<p>However, they are actually thinking that they do not want to talk to you and 
you are not wanted in the group. You didn&#39;t catch their intentions because you 
were obliviant to their body language signs, creating a bad impression. </p>
<h3>Example 2: Entrepreneurship </h3>
<p></p>
<p>You are an entrepreneur, you just had an amazing idea but you need funding 
and decide to schedule a meeting with a couple of angel investors. You start your pitch, and in the beginning they are hooked and interested.
However, after some time they start to think about different stuff because 
your product does not interest them or there is something you did that turned 
them off. </p>
<p>How are you going to know what they were thinking if you can&#39;t read body 
language and assess what your next move should be? Knowing how to read people will help you understand when you should back off 
or keep selling and close the deal based on their reactions. </p>
<h3>Example 3: Love at First Sight </h3>
<p></p>
<p>Another example would be when you are somewhere and you see a girl/guy you 
are interested in and you want to know if your advances would be well received.
If you were able to read the person and check for availability/invitational 
signs you would be on your way to getting his/her phone number. 
</p>
<h3>Example 4: Applying for a Job </h3>
<p>Last but not least, when you are applying for a job. The most important part 
of a job interview is how you present yourself to the employer. The clothes that you choose to dress, the way you walk, speak and the kind of 
vibes you send out all matter in creating the best first impression. Think about your last job interview. Do you think you looked confident, needy 
or afraid? By learning body language you can understand how to change your behavioral 
gestures in order to display a certain image of yourself, hopefully increasing 
the chances of being hired.<br>
</p>
<h2>How do I start reading people? </h2>
<p>Deep down, in our subconscious, we all know how to read body language. It&#39;s 
something we call instincts. And that is what I want to bring out of you today. So, how do you actually use your instincts to read people? With the BASELINE 
METHOD! In essence, it&#39;s something quite simple, but it works, because it&#39;s based on 
the principle of comparison. </p>
<p>Think about the last time you met somebody. What can you actually recall from 
the interaction? That they were nice? What their name was? That&#39;s a good start, but I invite you to consider this step by step process:
</p>
<h2>The Baseline Method </h2>
<h3>Step 1. Meeting the person<br>
</h3>
<p>As soon as you meet somebody you should start examining their body language, 
like: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Their Handshake (http handshake)</li>
	<li>Their Eye Contact</li>
	<li>Their Posture </li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 2. First Interaction </h3>
<p><br>
As you start talking to them, ask them questions and try to get to know their 
background story and what they do for a living. </p>
<p>Tip: Focus on questions that the person doesn&#39;t have a reason to lie or get 
uncomfortable. </p>
<p>Your objective in this step is to: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Establish a baseline of normal body language of the person in order to 
understand what their typical behavior looks like </li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 3. Compare Behaviors </h3>
<p>Now that you have the normal behavior of the person, you have to watch for 
changes in body language signs. </p>
<p>The easiest way to see a difference is to notice when somebody gets 
uncomfortable after something happens or is said. </p>
<h4>Example 1: </h4>
<p>You are talking to somebody and you&#39;re telling them a story, and at first 
they are very interested, with their whole body towards you. However, after a while, they lose interest in the story and their body starts 
to point in another direction, away from you (best indicator: feet direction).
This is a change from their typical behavior that you should look out for. 
Resolve this issue by immediately asking them a question and let them talk. </p>
<h4>Example 2: </h4>
<p>If you look at somebody&#39;s smile you can also see when it goes from genuine to 
fake. This is the typical transition you can spot when the person you are 
talking to goes from a genuine to a fake smile.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Avoid these Mistakes for Success </h2>
<p>We all want to give the best impressions, but sometimes we don&#39;t know how.
</p>
<p>So, here are two mistakes I recommend you to avoid and fix, to improve your 
overall image: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Bad Posture</li>
	<li>Closed Positions </li>
</ul>
<h3>Bad Posture </h3>
<p>Nowadays we see more and more people with a horrible posture walking down the 
street, and I think it is mostly due to two reasons: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Time spent seated</li>
	<li>Time spent hunching over phones </li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, these are very common in our society. But I have a few 
solutions: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Try to work standing up, or take frequent breaks to walk around</li>
	<li>Spend less time in your phone</li>
	<li>Exercise </li>
</ul>
<h3>Closed Positions </h3>
<p>This is quite a simple concept to understand but you have to be very diligent 
with yourself in order to fix it. Basically, the objective is to avoid closed off positions. When you adopt 
open body positions you&#39;ll feel and look more open minded and confident.<br>
<br>

<p>Now that I have presented you with: </p>
<p>• All the Reasons to Learn Body Language<br>
• The Baseline Method<br>
• The Two Mistakes to Avoid </p>
<p>I invite you to join this path (http://simplebodylanguage.com/get-updates/) 
with me, in a mission to better ourselves each and every day. </p>
