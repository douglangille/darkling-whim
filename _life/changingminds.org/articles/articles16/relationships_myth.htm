Why the Need to Build Relationships is a Myth</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In 1937 Dale Carnegie published his celebrated How to Win Friends and Influence 
People - the first book suggesting sellers build relationships. 1937: with 
primitive transportation, sellers found clients closer to home; telephones were 
emerging (FYI – Morse Code was preferred for 40 years after the telephone was 
invented!); marketing avenues were limited, as was advertising (Sears Catalogue, 
Life Magazine, The Farmer’s Almanac, the local paper or general store). 
Obviously there was no technology, or global competition.<p>
Selling focused on natural customers - face-to-face relationships with neighbors 
and friends. And buyers needed sellers for information and relevance. 
Relationships were vital. <p>
It’s now 2016. We have a plethora of options to present our solutions. Our 
communications capability is global, cheap, and ubiquitous. With safe payment 
and delivery options, global competitors are pervasive. And – here’s the big one 
- our prospects have the ability to receive the information they need to easily 
choose a solution without us. Buyers contact us only when they’ve done their 
Pre-Sales change work and are ready. They don’t need a relationship with us. 
<h2>
THE PLOY OF BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS</h2>
<p>
So why do we continue to think we must ‘build relationships’?? As a carryover 
from Carnegie, relationship building has been used as a ploy to manipulate a 
sale. If buyers like us, the thinking goes, they’ll buy. Here’s the reality:<ul>
	<li>Everyone knows you’re pretending. Until you’ve known people over time, through 
the good times and bad, you’re not in a relationship with anyone, especially 
when you’re trying to be nice so you can meet your own agenda. </li>
	<li>Your ‘relationship’ will not facilitate a sale. Buyers cannot buy unless they 
have managed their internal change management journey that </li>
	</ul>
	<blockquote>
		<ol>
			<li>assembles all the people needed to be involved and hears their 
voices/concerns/criteria; </li>
			<li>gets buy-in from the Buying Decision Team that something must change;
			</li>
			<li>figures out how to meet everyone’s needs and make adjustments that fit 
without internal disruption.</li>
			</ol>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
Buyers can’t buy until they’re ready, willing, and able to bring something new 
into their status quo regardless of how ‘nice’ you are.<p>
Buyers aren’t swayed by your niceness. It will, however, make you a preferred 
vendor WHEN ALL ELSE IS EQUAL and WHEN THEY HAVE REACHED THE POINT OF CHOICE.
</p>
<p>It doesn’t work when your focus is a sale. Here is a real dialogue: 
			<p class="quote">
SELLER: HI SHARON! AND how are YOU today??<p class="quote">
SDM: [picking up the phone in tears, thinking it was my friend] My name’s not 
Sharon! And I’m rotten. I just put my dog down!<p>
I offered an ‘authentic’ moment, useful as an opportunity to connect: he should 
have said ‘I’m sorry that happened. Obviously you can&#39;t speak now. Is there a 
better time? This is a sales call and I&#39;d like to discuss X when you&#39;re feeling 
better.’ <p>
Whether for a large, complex sale, or a small personal item, buyers cannot buy 
until they have their internal ducks in a row, and then agree to seek an 
external solution (Step 10 of a 13 Step process). Because the sales model 
focuses on placing solutions – possible only after buyers have completed their 
Pre-Sales change management issues – we can’t discern where buyers are along 
their Buying Decision Path and buyers show up seeking a transactional 
connection. Our ‘niceness’ (which I’m differentiating from real customer 
service) is irrelevant; we just sound like everyone else trying to sell them 
something.<h2>
DIFFERENTIATION?</h2>
			<p>
I’m told sellers use the ‘make nice’ ploy to differentiate – difficult using the 
conventional sales route. Following acceptable marketing criteria of the era – 
words and phrases that are in vogue, graphics and colors that are deemed ‘what 
everyone is doing’ – it’s hard to be unique. And the myth of being a 
‘Relationship Manager’ or ‘creating a relationship’ is supposed to show buyers 
why they should choose us over the competition. See?? I’m NICE! <p>
Here’s the truth: buyers don’t start off wanting to buy anything whether it 
sounds like they have a need or not. They merely want solve a problem. But they 
have work to do before they’re ready. It’s only once they’ve determined their 
systemic change management requirements that they’ll buy - but by then they’ll 
haven chosen their list of vendors and solutions from online data or referrals.<p>
By focusing on attempting to influence people to buy because we’re nice, we’re 
left out of their behind-the-scenes decision process and reduced to ‘being 
there’ when/if they show up (the low hanging fruit, or 5%). Not to mention 
chasing bad leads with folks who we think should be buyers (Prospects are those 
who WILL buy, not those who SHOULD buy.). <p>
We can mitigate this and REALLY be nice by entering enter early and facilitating 
buyers along the route of their systemic change/Pre Sales path. I’ve coded the 
steps in their decision sequence and developed a model that facilitates 
Pre-Sales Buyer Readiness (Buying Facilitation®). You don’t have to use my model 
– create your own! But entering the buyer/seller interaction as a change 
facilitator will differentiate you and enable a true relationship.<p>
Buyers would never buy from anyone else when a seller has taught the prospect 
how to assemble ALL of the folks necessary to be part of the Decision Team, or 
HOW to get everyone on board for change. Remember: they will do this anyway 
before they buy – they might as well do this with you.<p>
There’s a way to make money AND make nice. It’s by being a true Servant Leader 
and change facilitator; by entering into a WE Space in which there is a tracit 
agreement that everyone will be served. Stop using ‘nice’ as a sales ploy. Stop 
focusing on the low hanging fruit. Add a change management focus and find real 
buyers who&#39;ve already recognized a problem, and first facilitate them through 
their route to inclusive, congruent, systemic change. Then you can become part 
of the Buying Decision Team, make a difference, close more, waste less time, and 
act with integrity.</p>
