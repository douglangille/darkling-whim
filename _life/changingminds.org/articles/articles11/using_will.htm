Using the Will: Key Points</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Rick Hanson</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
<p>Using the will means helping yourself to want the good thing, to stick with 
your good
resolutions and intentions easily, without white-knuckling. </p>
<p>It's a combination of virtue and good purposes. Virtue is more static, while 
purpose is
more active, but they intertwine. </p>
<h2>
Concentration</h2>
<p>
Building the capacity to concentrate, to sustain a focus of attention, helps 
burn off the 
sluggishness and unconsciousness that undermine your virtues and purposes. <p>
Basic instructions for doing a concentration meditation: 
<ul>
	<li>Eyes open or closed </li>
	<li>Focus on a specific body sensation &#8211; typically the sensations of the breath 
around the
upper lip and nostrils &#8211; and keep returning to that no matter what else arises 
in awareness. 
You can think about all that other stuff later. Keep letting that other stuff go 
to return 
attention to your breath.</li>
	<li>Try to be aware of each breath freshly, as an individual breath. </li>
	<li>Try to apply attention to the beginning of each inhalation and exhalation and 
then sustain
attention all the way to the end of the breath. </li>
	<li>Try to be even aware of the brief pause after inhaling and before exhaling, 
and the pause
after exhalation before inhaling. </li>
	<li>You can post a little guard, as it were, that is continually paying attention 
to where your
attention goes, so that little guard will sound an alert if your attention 
starts to wander. </li>
	<li>Notice when your attention tends to fade. It&#8217;s often after four or five 
breaths, almost a kind
of fatigue. Be especially alert at those junctures to keep returning attention 
to the breath. </li>
	<li>It can help to count the breaths; a complete breath is 1. If you lose track, 
just start over. You can either count up &#8211; 1-2-3 . . . &#8211; or down: 10-9-8-7 . . . .
	</li>
	<li>You could also experiment with a soft verbal noting in your mind of what is 
happening - such as &quot;In . . . . . Out&quot; or &quot;Rising . . . . Falling&quot; - giving that noting 
maybe 5% of your attention,
most of it remaining with the physical sensations of the breath. </li>
	<li>Don&#8217;t strain to do this, or be critical of yourself. Find a middle place 
between straining and
being lackadaisical. Intend to become absorbed in the breath. </li>
	<li>You may find that you fall into relaxed state of absorption after awhile that 
is quite
pleasant and peaceful and doesn&#8217;t take much effort. Or you may experience a 
continual sense of 
muscular effort needed to concentrate on the breath. Either one is alright. </li>
	</ul>
	<h2>
Being For Yourself</h2>
	<p>
There&#8217;s a fundamental question of whether you are for yourself, whether you are 
on your own 
side. Especially regarding your true, deep interests: your long-term health, 
well-being, 
happiness, love, and success. <p>
For some, this comes naturally, while others - especially those who were 
criticized, 
neglected, or shamed a lot as children, or otherwise have developed a sense of 
learned 
helplessness - have to work at it. <p>
Four different ways to cultivate the attitude of being for yourself: <p>
<b>1. Reflect on how you want to be fair to others</b>. Reflect on your natural, basic 
goodwill
toward others. On how you wish others well. On how you would want to treat them 
decently, 
with ordinary consideration, civility, respect, and kindness. <p>
Let these ideas become feelings in your body, feelings of simple consideration 
and decency 
toward others. <p>
Now imagine or get a sense of yourself as another one of the people on the 
planet. Perhaps 
imagine meeting yourself in a group, in a work setting, as a neighbor, etc. <p>
Try to apply the same standards of fairness and decency toward yourself that you 
would 
naturally apply to anyone: why not you, too? <p>
Try to bring the same feelings, the same emotions, of care and goodwill to 
yourself that 
you would naturally bring to other people. <p>
<b>2. Consider your own child or children, or other children you know, or children 
in general. </b> <p>
Call to awareness the sense, the feelings, of caring for children. Let it fill 
you. <p>
Now get a sense of yourself as a little child. Good. Try to apply those feelings 
of caring to 
that child you once were, long ago. <p>
Now sense the young parts that are still within you today. Maybe get an image of 
that, 
perhaps an image of a child. Apply feelings of caring, of sweetness, tenderness, 
even love, to 
those young parts inside you. Soak this in. <p>
<b>3. Think thoughts to yourself that wish yourself well</b>. Such as, &#8220;May you be 
happy. May you
be at peace. May you be well. May your heart be at ease. May your body be at 
ease.&#8221; <p>
Perhaps also think of specific wounds or needs or long-time desires in yourself, 
and offer 
lovingkindness that is related to those. <p>
You can experiment with different forms, like &#8220;May I feel good about who I am&#8221; 
or &#8220;May 
you, John (or Susan) feel good about who you are.&#8221; <p>
You can use both all-purpose statements &#8211; like &#8220;May I stay healthy&#8221; &#8211; and ones 
specific to 
particular needs or issues, like &#8220;May I release my anger. May I stay cool with 
the kids. May I 
think before speaking.&#8221; <p>
<b>4. Reflect on how being for yourself</b> &#8211; so that your well-being and functioning 
improve &#8211; will
help other people, especially the ones you care about most. <p>
For example, bring to mind some aspect of your life, or some way that you are, 
that would 
clearly get better if you were more on your own side, if you were more 
supportive of yourself to <p>
go in a better direction. Consider how it would help and contribute to others, 
for you to be for 
yourself in that area. <p>
Try this for a second example of how being for yourself would be good for 
others. <h2>
Key Virtues</h2>
	<p>
<b>1. List three or more important virtues that you routinely embody</b> &#8211; perhaps 
virtues that are
very central to your specific personality or character. <p>
A single word will often do, but it&#8217;s OK to add some additional words if that&#8217;s 
what 
speaks to your heart. <p>
For each one, first get the feeling, sense, or even posture of that virtue . . . 
and then soak in 
that feeling (i.e., Taking In). 
	<p>
<b>2. List three or more important virtues that you would like to live by better</b>. Do 
some soulsearching here. <p>
Sometimes it helps to be a little quiet in your mind and ask your innermost 
being &#8211; or even 
the Divine, if that&#8217;s meaningful to you &#8211; for what it thinks. <p>
It&#8217;s OK if there&#8217;s a bit of wincing or remorse as you do this; remember that you 
are being a 
good person in your willingness to acknowledge where you could be even better. 
<p>
Some classics, just to prime your pump: Patience. Restraint of anger. Courage. 
Sobriety. 
Cheerfulness. Determination. Love. Generosity. <p>
Now for each one, take 30 seconds or so to do three things: 
	<ul>
		<li>Get the feeling of it in your body &#8211; and let that sink in.
		</li>
		<li>Reflect on the benefits to you and others of living more from that virtue &#8211; 
and get an
experience of those benefits in your body (more than a conceptual knowing of the 
benefits) 
&#8211; and let the enjoyable experience of those benefits sink in </li>
		<li>Right here and now, make a choice about whether you will commit to that 
virtue, knowing
that you can make a different choice in the future </li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
Life Priorities</h2>
		<p>
<b>Think of major areas, domains, or activities of your life. </b> <p>
Like Health, Spirituality, Love, Pleasure, Marriage, Childrearing, Career, 
Creative <p>
Expression, Finances. <p>
Write them out as a list. <p>
<b>Now re-write that list in priority order</b>. Sorry, no ties are allowed! Think of 
this as an
exercise; in real life we tend to pursue multiple priorities. <p>
One way to do this is, ask yourself if you could have just one of those 
priorities fulfilled, 
which would it be? OK, then take that one off the table and repeat the question 
with the 
remaining priorities. <p>
<b>When you have your priority list, take an honest look at it</b>. Tell the truth to 
yourself about
how you are and how you are not living your life accordingly. <p>
Make any notes to yourself about anything you want to start doing differently.
<p>
It&#8217;s OK to feel abashed, chagrined, or remorseful. Let those feelings become a 
conviction 
that you want to live truer to your real priorities . . . and let the feeling of 
that conviction really 
sink in. <p>
Concrete Admonitions/Aspirations for the Day, Week, and Month<p>
<b>Put a heading on a piece of paper like</b>: &#8220;Admonitions/Aspirations,&#8221; &#8220;My 
Precepts,&#8221; &#8220;I
Agree To,&#8221; &#8220;How To Make My Life Work.&#8221; Whatever works for you. 
		<h2>
Daily </h2>
		<p>
<b>Create a sub-heading: &#8220;Daily.&#8221;</b> Under it, list bottom-line do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts for 
yourself that
you want to do each day or always. Like: 
		<ul>
			<li>Don&#8217;t smoke </li>
			<li>Go to bed early enough to get up to meditate the next morning
			</li>
			<li>Meditate </li>
			<li>Don&#8217;t sneak sweets </li>
			<li>No porn </li>
			<li>Do not speak or act out of anger </li>
			<li>No spanking the kids </li>
			<li>Be loving and affectionate with my mate </li>
			<li>Spend 15+ minutes of quality time with each child </li>
			<li>Don&#8217;t let Bob/Mary/whoever get to me </li>
			<li>No dope </li>
			<li>No alcohol</li>
			<li>Play the piano </li>
			<li>Read something spiritual </li>
			<li>Re-center myself at every meal </li>
			</ul>
			<h2>
Weekly </h2>
			<p>
<b>Create a new sub-heading: Weekly</b>. This list is for things that you don&#8217;t do 
daily but want
to do at least once a week. Like exercising three times a week, or taking on a 
dinner or two 
instead of your wife making it, or initiating sex with your husband (!). <p>
Under it, list bottom-line do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts for yourself that you want to do each 
week. <h2>
Monthly </h2>
			<p>
<b>Create a new sub-heading: Monthly</b>. This is for those few remaining activities 
that you
want to do less often than weekly but at least once a month. Like have people 
over for dinner, 
see a play, do something really fun with your partner, or take a neat class. <p>
Under it, list bottom-line do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts for yourself that you want to do each 
month. <h2>
Reflection </h2>
			<p>
<b>Look over all your admonitions/aspirations</b>. Get a sense of the benefits to you 
and others
of you actually living your life this way. Have the experience of those benefits 
sink in. <p>
<b>On the basis of all that, see if you are willing to commit to this plan for 
your life in a
serious, real way</b>. If not, so be it, but if yes, GREAT. <p>
<b>Imagine being retired, much older but still healthy and vigorous, and you're 
reflecting back on your life</b>. Imagine something concrete and specific, like 
sitting on the porch of a cabin
by a lake musing about your life. <p>
Now imagine that you - as that older, future you - are reflecting on what 
happened in your life when you started living by the admonitions/aspirations you 
just created. <p>
Looking backwards from that future point in time, really imagine how your life 
unfolded on the basis of the admonitions/aspirations you just created. <p>
Try to consider specific aspects of your life in this light, such as your 
career, or your love relationships, or your spiritual/personal development. <p>
Really help the fruits of this consideration sink into you. <h2>
Conclusion</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>What are you seeing and learning about the virtues and purposes and concrete 
actions that would be good for you to commit yourself to? About how you can help 
yourself stay the course with those commitments? </li>
				<li>And don&#8217;t forget: The inner skills are only worth something if you use them! 
				</li>
				</ol>
