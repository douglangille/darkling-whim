<h1>Mindful Presence</h1>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="../articles.htm">Guest articles</a> &gt; 
Mindful Presence</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p>
What Is Mindful Presence?<p>
This article is about developing the skill of mindful presence. <p>
Let&#8217;s unpack those two words, mindful presence. <p>
Mindfulness is simply a clear, non-judgmental awareness of your inner and outer
worlds. In particular, it&#8217;s an awareness of the flow of experience in your inner 
world 
&#8211; an alert observing of your thoughts, emotions, body sensations, desires, 
memories, 
images, personality dynamics, attitudes, etc.
<p>
When you are mindful of something, you are observing it, not caught up in it and 
not 
identified with it. The psychological term, &#8220;the observing ego&#8221; &#8211; considered to 
be 
essential for healthy functioning &#8211; refers to this capacity (i.e., mindfulness) 
to detach 
from the stream of consciousness and observe it. Other terms for this capacity
include bare witnessing and the Fair Witness. <p>
Mindfulness is an everyday psychological capacity, not some kind of lofty 
mystical 
state. To quote an unidentified meditation master: &quot;Even children, drunkards,
madmen, those who are old, or those who are illiterate, can develop 
mindfulness.&quot;<p>
Presence refers to the stability of mindfulness, which means the degree to which 
you 
are grounded in awareness itself. <p>
With practice, awareness becomes increasingly your home base, your refuge, 
rather 
than the contents of awareness. You abide more and more as the field of 
awareness 
upon which experiences arise, register, and pass away. <p>
The sense of awareness itself starts taking up more and more space in your daily
experience; you certainly still get caught up in and swept along by mental 
contents 
many times a day, but you find there is more of a feeling of background 
awareness 
even then, plus you return to the awareness position more quickly, and stay 
there 
longer.
<p>
As mindful presence increases, there is a growing sense of being as the 
container of 
your everyday life, which holds the doing and the having of daily activities. 
You are being being. Doing and having no longer contain little moments of being; 
instead,
being is increasingly the ongoing space through which ripples of doing and 
having 
come and go. <p>
This quality of abiding as awareness moves out into your life beyond time spent
meditating. Simply stretching your hand for a cup of coffee or tea becomes 
increasingly infused with a sense of full awareness of that act. So with other 
physical 
activities.
<p>
With people, you become more settled into being fully there with them, more 
peacefully relaxed in awareness of them and you and what&#8217;s happening, less 
identified with pleasant or unpleasant reactions that arise, less caught up in 
the past 
or future or sense of needing to make something happen. We can feel it 
immediately
when someone else is mindfully present with us; similarly, others can feel it 
when 
you are that way yourself. <h2>
What is the Neuropsychology of Mindful Presence?</h2>
<p>
When you are mindfully present, you are activating the most fundamental, central
circuits of the nervous system, namely core consciousness and the 
parasympathetic 
nervous system. It is interesting and really nice that the experience of these 
bedrock 
circuits is so pleasant and comfortable.
<p>
Core consciousness is supported by structures in the brain stem and limbic 
system; 
these are ancient, in an evolutionary sense, and are used by animals to survive 
by 
registering both external events &#8211; food, predators, etc. &#8211; and internal states 
(e.g., pain, 
thirst) <p>
The parasympathetic wing of the autonomic nervous system is responsible for the
fundamental maintenance of bodily functions, including breathing, heart beat,
digestion, rest, and sleep. Its complement is the sympathetic nervous system, 
which 
is responsible for both &#8220;go-get-it&#8221; responses to opportunities and &#8220;fight or 
flight&#8221; 
responses to stress. Even though that sympathetic wing gets a lot of attention 
in our 
go-go, consumer pleasure, aggressive, action movie, videogame culture, the parasympathetic system is more central: you can live without your sympathetic
nervous system, but if your parasympathetic nervous system were deactivated, you
would die quickly.
<p>
The parasympathetic nervous system was the topic of the first class in the Train 
Your 
Brain series, and for more information, go to the Wise Brain website and 
download 
the talk and article from that class. <h2>
Why Develop Mindful Presence?</h2>
<p>
Mindful presence feels good in its own right: relaxed, alert, and peaceful. Not
contending with anything. No struggle.
<p>
In addition to the inherent, experiential rewards of mindful presence, studies 
have 
shown that it lowers stress, makes discomfort and pain more bearable, reduces
depression, and increases self-knowledge and self-acceptance. <p>
To quote the father of American psychology, William James: 
<p class="quote">
&#8220;The faculty of
voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention, over and over again, is the 
very 
root of judgment, character, and will. No one is compos sui [master of himself] 
if he 
have it not. An education which should improve this faculty would be the 
education
par excellence. But it is easier to define this ideal than to give practical 
directions for 
bringing it about.&#8221;&nbsp; --
William James, Psychology: Briefer Course, p. 424 (Harper Torchbooks, 1961) 
<p>
At a deeper level, mindful presence is the counter to our habitual state of 
mind, 
which a Thai meditation master once summarized as, &#8220;Lost in thought.&#8221; <p>
To quote Jack Kornfield:
<p class="quote">
&#8220; . . . you [become] mindful of the constantly changing
conditions of sight, sound, taste, smell, physical perceptions, feelings, and 
thoughts. 
Through mindfulness practice, you [begin] to experience how conditioned the 
world 
is and how these conditions constantly change.
<p class="quote">
To free ourselves, we need to quiet the mind through some mindfulness in 
meditation. Then, instead of identifying with the changing conditions, we learn 
to 
release them and turn toward consciousness itself, to rest in the knowing. Ajahn
Chah called this pure awareness, &#8220;the original mind,&#8221; and resting in &#8220;the one 
who
knows.&#8221; <p class="quote">
The senses and the world are always changing conditions, but that which 
knows is unconditioned. With practice . . . we can be in the midst of an 
experience, 
being upset or angry or caught by some problem, and then step back from it and 
rest 
in pure awareness. . . We learn to trust pure awareness itself.&#8221; --
Jack Kornfield, Buddhadharma, Summer 2007, pp. 34-35 <p>
And in addition to the psychological, everyday benefits of mindful presence, it 
is 
also, in Buddhism, considered to be a direct path to enlightenment and the end 
of suffering:<p class="quote">
&quot;This is the one-way path for the purification of beings, for the surmounting of
sorrow and lamentations, for the passing away of pain and dejection, for the 
attainment of the true way, for the realization of Nibbana - namely, the four
establishments of mindfulness.
<p class="quote">
&quot;What are the four? A person dwells contemplating the body in the body, ardent,
clearly comprehending, and mindful, having subdued longing and dejection in 
regard to the world. He or she dwells contemplating feelings in feelings, 
ardent, 
clearly comprehending, mindful, having subdued longing and dejection in regard 
to 
the world. He or she dwells contemplating mind in mind, ardent, clearly 
comprehending, mindful, having subdued longing and dejection in regard to the
world. He or she dwells contemplating phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly
comprehending, mindful, having subdued longing and dejection in regard to the
world.&quot; --
[In the Buddha's Words., p. 281]
<p>
This isn&#8217;t the place to get into detail about that quote, though I invite you to 
let the 
feeling of it carry you along. And for more information, you can go the article 
on our 
website about the Eightfold Path and read the section on Right Mindfulness. <p>
But in passing, it is worth noting that &quot;contemplating body in the body&quot; (or 
feelings 
in feelings, mind in mind, phenomena in phenomena) means being simply aware of
immediate, experiential phenomena as they are without conceptualization or <p>
commentary. Just the sensations of the rising breath in the belly. Just the 
subtle 
feeling of a sound being mildly unpleasant. Just the sense of consciousness 
being 
contracted or spacious. Just a single thought emerging and then disappearing. 
Just 
this moment. Just this. <p>
There&#8217;s a pithy summary of this simplicity of pure experiencing in the advice 
the 
Buddha gave to a man named Bahiya: <p class="quote">
&#8220;Bahiya, you should train yourself in this way: With the seen, there will be 
just
the seen; with the heard, there will be just the heard; with the sensed 
(touched,
tasted, smelt) there will be just the sensed; with the cognized [thoughts, 
feelings, 
etc.], there will be just the cognized.&#8221; <p>
In sum, imagine being in a lovely and peaceful meadow, with a train full of 
thoughts 
and feelings and desires rolling by in the distance . . . Normally, as this 
train 
approaches we tend to become drawn in, and we hop on board and get carried away
. . . &#8220;lost in thought.&#8221; 
<p>
On the other hand, mindfulness allows you to see the train coming but have the
presence of mind . . . to stay in the meadow! And whenever you get swept along 
by 
the train, as soon as you notice that, whoosh, you return immediately to the 
peaceful 
meadow, to the refuge of mindfulness.<h2>
Concentration Tune Up </h2>
<p>
Steady mindfulness requires overcoming the natural &#8211; and evolutionarily adaptive 
&#8211; 
tendency of mind to scan endlessly and think of new things. <p>
So the basic capacity to steady the mind &#8211; called concentration, as a short-hand 
&#8211; is a 
condition for mindfulness. <p>
We covered concentration in the last TYB class, so check out the talk from that 
class
on the Wise Brain website &#8211; and the &#8220;Factors of Concentration&#8221; at the end of 
this 
article, below. You could also look at the Right Concentration section of the 
Eightfold 
Path article on the website. <p>
Right here, if you like, you can do a little tune-up of concentration skills as 
a <p>
foundation for the mindful presence exercises we will be presenting further on.
<h3>
Instructions </h3>
<p>
You could take 10 minutes or so to just concentrate on one thing. You can pick
whatever object you like, but we&#8217;ll will give instructions in terms of the 
sensations of 
the breath felt around the upper lip. If those are too subtle, you could also 
use the 
sensations in the belly.
<p>
For concentration, it&#8217;s generally best to pick a single, focused object of 
attention &#8211; 
such as the sensations of the breath in one area, rather than the feeling of 
breathing 
overall &#8211; and stick with that object rather than moving from object to object. 
<p>
So let&#8217;s get started: 
<ul>
	<li>Sit in a relaxed yet comfortable position. </li>
	<li>Eyes open or closed, whatever works for you. Eyes closed often helps people
	</li>
	<li>focus on the breath. </li>
	<li>If you feel sleepy you could open your eyes or stand up. </li>
	<li>Try to be aware of the sensations of each breath &#8211; inhalation and exhalation &#8211;
	</li>
	<li>from beginning to end. Train Your Brain 6 </li>
	<li>Filling Your Cupboard </li>
	<li>It&#8217;s OK to have your mind wander some. Just return your attention to the
	</li>
	<li>breath. Be kind to yourself as you do so. </li>
	<li>If you like, you could count each breath, and start over when you get to 10 or 
if </li>
	<li>you lose track. </li>
	<li>Try to be with each breath as a fresh, unique breath, an individual in its own
	</li>
	<li>right. </li>
	<li>Increase your attentiveness if you feel it starting to crumble or wander.
	</li>
	<li>Keep watching your quality of intention and focus. You are watching the
	</li>
	<li>watching to make sure the watcher is doing a good job. </li>
	<li>You&#8217;ll be getting increasingly absorbed in the sensations of the breath.
	</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
OK, let&#8217;s dive in. <p>
[However much time you like . . . . . . ] <p>
OK, how was that for you? <p>
What helped you stabilize attention, steady your mind? <h2>
Basic Mindfulness</h2>
	<p>
Next, we are going to shift to a standard form of mindfulness meditation, in 
which 
you keep maybe a third of your attention on your breath (or something else) that
helps stabilize and anchor your attention. With the rest of your attention, you 
are 
simply aware of whatever else streams through awareness. <p>
Remembering the metaphor of the meadow, you are not getting caught up in the 
&#8220;trains&#8221; of mental contents, but simply watching them go by. <p>
You may find it helpful to softly note some of those contents, including more 
global 
states of mind, such as &#8220;thinking,&#8221; &#8220;worry,&#8221; &#8220;itching,&#8221; &#8220;pressure,&#8221; &#8220;coughing,&#8221;
&#8220;peacefulness,&#8221; &#8220;quiet,&#8221; &#8220;restlessness,&#8221; &#8220;doubt,&#8221; &#8220;self,&#8221; etc. <p>
If your mind wanders, just bring it back to the breath. If it is wandering a 
lot, maybe 
take a minute to re-establish concentration on the breath &#8211; so it is your only 
focus for
that minute &#8211; and then resume the standard mindfulness meditation. <p>
You may find your mind growing very quiet or peaceful or happy. Then those 
states 
of mind are what is present in awareness, and you can be mindful of that. <p>
It is alright to have a gentle quality of investigation, of curiosity, but this 
is not the 
time to psychoanalyze yourself &#8211; you can get caught up in investigation just 
like any 
other mental content. <p>
It&#8217;s also alright to register insights into yourself individually or into the 
general 
nature of mind or existence. You can take a moment to digest the insight so it
becomes a part of you and available for reflection later, and then return to the 
formal 
mindfulness meditation. <h3>
Instructions </h3>
	<p>
So let&#8217;s begin. <p>
Find a comfortable posture. <p>
Find that stable anchor with the breath. Take a few breaths and be aware of 
their <p>
sensations. <p>
OK, let&#8217;s dive in. <p>
[However much time you like . . . . . . ] <p>
OK, how was that for you? <p>
Could you get a sense of spacious awareness, through which the contents of the
<p>
&#8220;stream of consciousness&#8221; flowed? <h2>
Open Space Mindfulness</h2>
	<p>
Now we are going to distill that mindfulness meditation down to its very 
essence:
abiding as awareness primarily, with little involvement with or even sense of 
the 
contents of awareness, almost indifferent to them. The focus is on the open 
space of 
awareness itself &#8211; which is the name often used in Tibetan Buddhism for this 
sort of 
meditation. <p>
By the way, profound forms of this meditation go very very far, and are 
sometimes 
associated with the viewpoint that the primordial essence of awareness is 
&#8220;Buddhanature,&#8221; &#8220;stainless and pure and unconditioned,&#8221; and perhaps even
mysteriously Transcendental. <p>
We are not aiming so high, here tonight, and instead pursuing the everyday skill 
of 
being aware of awareness itself, and being able at will to rest &#8211; for at least 
seconds at 
a time &#8211; in such a way that awareness is the bulk of what one is experiencing, 
rather 
than its contents. <p>
You&#8217;ll note I spoke of seconds at a time. A few seconds spent abiding primarily 
as 
awareness are great! In the beginning, it is normal for that sense to &#8220;crumble&#8221; 
and for 
the field of experience to become dominated, as it usually is, by various 
thoughts and 
feelings, desires and plans, etc. With practice, the duration of your abiding as
awareness will lengthen, but for tonight it&#8217;s just fine to go into and out of 
it. <p>
You&#8217;ll also note that I keep using the word &#8220;resting.&#8221; Abiding as awareness is 
rooted 
in a deeply rested feeling &#8211; which is of course the epitome of the experience of 
the 
parasympathetic nervous system, whose motto is &#8220;rest and digest.&#8221; (Even more 
fitting, perhaps, is the motto of the Turtle Club: &#8220;Start slow and taper off.&#8221;) 
<p>
In fact, a traditional instruction for open awareness meditation is to imagine 
how you 
would feel at the end of a long day of good work, and you come home and just sit
down and rest. That sense of abandoning yourself to resting deeply, with a 
related 
feeling that it is healthy to do so, is a doorway to abiding as awareness. <p>
Here&#8217;s a quote from a Tibetan Buddhist teacher, Yongey Mingyar Rinpoche
[Rinpoche is a title, like sensei]: 
	<p class="quote">
&#8220;If you truly want to discover a lasting 
sense of
peace and contentment, you need to learn to rest your mind. Only by resting the
mind can its innate qualities be revealed. The simplest way to clear water 
obscured 
by mud and other sediments is to allow the water to grow still. In the same way, 
if 
you allow the mind to come to rest, ignorance, attachment, aversion, and all 
other 
mental afflictions will gradually settle, and the compassion, clarity, and 
infinite 
expanse of your mind&#8217;s real nature will be revealed.&#8221; --
The Joy of Living, p. 125 <p>
Since you are taking your home in awareness itself, the contents of mind don&#8217;t 
matter 
much. This includes perceptions such as sights and sounds. That is why people 
are 
encouraged, as they become more practiced with this mode of meditation &#8211; 
actually, 
this mode of being &#8211; to do it with their eyes open. Since sight is such a 
central sense &#8211; 
literally about a third of the cerebral cortex is devoted to visual processing &#8211; 
if you 
can become relatively disengaged from what you see through being deeply invested
in awareness itself, then you&#8217;ve come a real way. You can experiment with this
yourself during the brief meditations we are about to do, and try them sometimes
with eyes open and other times with your eyes closed. <p>
A couple more tips, and then we&#8217;ll try it: 
	<ul>
		<li>Some people find that it helps to bring to mind the spacious or luminous
quality of awareness, though sometimes the effort to sense spaciousness or 
luminousness simply turns them into more contents of mind, when in fact you want
to disengage from contents. </li>
		<li>You may find that when you are resting in awareness, that thoughts and
feelings come and go almost out of sight, as it were. That&#8217;s fine. To quote 
Mingyar
Rinpoche again: </li>
		</ul>
		<p class="quote">
&#8220;The real point of meditation is to rest in bare awareness 
whether
anything occurs or not. Whatever comes up for you, just be open and present to 
it, 
and let it go. And if nothing occurs, or if thoughts and so on vanish before you 
can 
notice them, just rest in that natural clarity. 
How much simpler could the process of meditation be?&#8221; --
The Joy of Living, p. 131 
		<ul>
			<li>Don&#8217;t worry if it seems hard at first. Awareness is completely natural: you&#8217;re
aware right now, right? In open awareness meditation, you&#8217;re simply abandoning
involvement with everything except awareness itself. Since awareness is your 
natural 
home base, your natural resting state, Mother Nature is on your side as you 
settle 
more and more into simple awareness. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
But keep in mind that resting in awareness is a skill like any other, and 
therefore 
takes time to practice. Try not to be frustrated or angry with yourself if this 
doesn&#8217;t 
come easily for you. If you bump into difficulties, there will still be 
benefits, since 
you will be gaining a good deal of insight into the activities of mind that 
carry you 
away from simple awareness. <h3>
Instructions</h3>
			<p>
Let&#8217;s try this for one minute. <p>
To repeat, get a sense of resting deeply, not trying to do anything at all, with 
your 
body deeply relaxed &#8211; especially the trunk of it &#8211; and simply have most of who 
you 
are in the moment be just awareness. <p>
OK, here we go. <p>
[About a minute . . . . . . . <p>
OK, how was that? <p>
Let&#8217;s try it again, this time for three minutes.&nbsp; <p>
OK, here we go. <p>
[About three minutes . . . . . . . <p>
OK, how was that? <p>
And now let&#8217;s try it again for a few minutes, but this time, how about trying it

Try to be as mindful as you can in daily life, and see what that&#8217;s like. Try to 
take your 
sense of mindful presence from exercises like in this article, or from your 
meditations, and bring that out into the world. Enjoy! <hr><p>
