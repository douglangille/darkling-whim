<h1>Are Your Communication Strategies Really Engaging Employees?</h1>

Are Your Communication Strategies Really Engaging Employees?</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Marcia Xenitelis</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The frequency at which the word &quot;engagement&quot; appears in any discussion about 
employee communication has begun to make me wonder whether we clearly understand 
what the term means. More importantly, do we understand what it means to our 
clients, particularly CEOs, when they talk about engagement? We have engagement 
tools, but can we really say that these tools actually engage employees in the 
process of change? Or are employees merely engaged with the tool itself?<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>There is only one question that you need ask yourself to find out whether 
your employee communication strategies are going to engage employees, rather 
than simply inform. That question is: Can you establish whether the tools and 
methods you are using to communicate with employees are changing attitudes and 
behavior or providing information?<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Employee engagement is a shared understanding of the issues that affect the 
business, and that understanding leads to changes in employees' attitudes and 
behaviors. Unless employees truly understand the issues and make a meaningful 
connection between their jobs and those issues, their attitudes and behaviors 
will not change. To achieve engagement, three things have to happen: The 
business issue has to mean something to the employee personally, the employee 
has to understand the issue (and I mean truly understand it, not just read about 
why it is an issue), and most important, each employee must be made to feel a 
part of the change process.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>As communicators we have the opportunity to become creative in how we 
communicate and engage employees. The ultimate aim in employee communication has 
to be to create the &quot;Aha!&quot; moment. This is the moment when employees have the 
necessary information and can say, &quot;Now it makes sense,&quot; &quot;Now I understand, &quot; 
&quot;Now I can do something about it.&quot;<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Tools are important in this process but generally they just communicate 
information. What we need to strive for are creative communication methods to 
engage employees in the process of change.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>There are five steps for identifying what the &quot;Aha&quot; moment is and they 
include the following:<br>
<br>
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Focus group research. Ask employees about their thoughts on the 
	organization and its competitors.</li>
	<li>Identify the largest gap between what customers think and what employees 
	think customers think.</li>
	<li>What would create a paradigm shift in employee's thinking?</li>
	<li>Can you measure the impact of the change in thinking?</li>
	<li>How significant is it to achieving the business objectives?<br>
	<br>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>So let's look at an example that would be familiar to communicators: the 
annual report announcement. Typically an online annual report would be made 
available to employees via the intranet. Some employees read it, but most tend 
to scroll down to the last pages to check the annual salaries of the senior 
executive staff and then close the document.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Let's imagine that the results in this annual report are very poor and the 
CEO is determined that employees understand the issues surrounding the poor 
results and become fully engaged to help turn the company around. Here's how one 
organization accomplished this.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>The company held four brown bag lunch meetings over four weeks where 
employees could attend for free for one hour and hear from an outside 
professional about how to invest in the share market. Importantly, there was no 
obvious link between the meeting topic and the organization the employees worked 
for. At week three, they were analyzing annual reports and generally deciding 
whether they would invest in a particular company based on the information 
contained in the report. By the fourth week they were given another annual 
report and asked the same question, &quot;would you invest in this company?&quot; The 
answer was overwhelmingly no. And of course this last company was the one they 
all worked for, which brought them to the &quot;Aha!&quot; moment. Now the organization's 
employees understood and were engaged and ready to become involved in turning 
the company around through teamwork and new initiatives.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Here are some steps you can follow to ensure that you can come up with 
creative ways to communicate with employees and engage them in the process of 
change.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>To challenge beliefs that your employees have about your organization, you 
need to have facts. The marketing department is an excellent source of facts 
about the business, with research on brand image, customer satisfaction, 
customer and non- customer views on competitors and information about market 
segments. Each of these areas provide valuable information on opportunities to 
link employees with business issues that can be measured. For example, the 
organization should have facts about how customers feel about the service 
provided by the organization's call centre. Employees will also have an opinion 
about how the believe customers perceive their service. By taking the results of 
the customer feedback and presenting it to staff this often creates an &quot;Aha 
moment&quot; because customer feedback is typically better than what employees 
anticipate. Once you have shared this information, the objective is to then 
explore ways that employees can become engaged in further improving that 
customer feedback. Focus groups <br>
are another excellent way to find out what employees think about different 
aspects of these areas and how their beliefs can be challenged as you need to 
help them better understand the issues that affect the business.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Key sources of business data are customer experience data, business results 
by product or service stream, competitor customer feedback, and measures of the 
attributes of your brand. These are sources of data that you can use as a 
measure of improvement as a result of your employee engagement strategy.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>When selecting business outcomes as a measure for your employee communication 
strategy, you need to be quite certain that the strategy you implement can 
actually affect the business outcomes you have decided to focus on.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Finally, when it comes to any employee engagement strategy, whether it be 
total transformation of a business or improvement in one aspect, you can rarely 
go it alone. Partnering with other areas of your organization including 
marketing and human resources will ensure that the optimum outcome is achieved 
for your organization.</p>
