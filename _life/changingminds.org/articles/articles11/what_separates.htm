What separates the Great Sales Pros from &#8216;the rest&#8217;? Probably not what you first think&#8230;</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Luke McLeod</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you think of gentlemanly professions, I&#8217;m sure titles such as Doctor, 
Teacher &amp; Philanthropist come to mind. But I&#8217;d bet my right arm that Salesman 
didn&#8217;t arise. Why? Well this post isn&#8217;t about the perception most people have of 
sales people (if you want to read more on that topic I recommend you read the 
&#8220;<a href="sales_dirty.htm">Why is SALES such a dirty word?</a>&#8221; article). Today is all about what separates 
the Great Sales Professionals to &#8216;the rest&#8217; and it&#8217;s probably not what you&#8217;d 
first think. </p>
<p>Since I started my career in sales, some number of years ago, I was amazed at 
the massive gap between the top performing sales professionals and the others. 
It didn&#8217;t matter where I went there was always one or two star performers and 
then there was &#8216;the rest&#8217;. I found this quite peculiar and decided to look 
deeper into the reasons why this was the case. What I found wasn&#8217;t 
groundbreaking, however it wasn&#8217;t what I had first expected. Those that were 
consistently at the top weren&#8217;t necessarily the most experienced or skilled or 
even the most talented. What I discovered the difference was was the way they 
carried themselves. Their attitude. </p>
<p>I noticed that when I spoke with and hung around these &#8216;Top Shelf&#8217; performers 
I didn&#8217;t get the feeling at all that they were &#8216;sales people&#8217;, I got the feeling 
that were&#8230;well&#8230; gentleman. Men (&amp; women) who went about everything they did in a 
great, respectful and integral way. </p>
<p class="quote"><i>&quot;They were always more interested in what those around them had to say and 
continually went deeper with their conversations, asking questions that made who 
ever they were talking with feel valued and respected.&quot; </i> </p>
<p>Whereas when I talked with &#8216;the rest&#8217; they always seemed rushed, short and 
vague. </p>
<p>Another subtle characteristic I noticed in these &#8216;gentleman&#8217; was their quiet 
sense of modest confidence. They always seemed in control of what they were 
saying and new exactly where to take the conversation next. After many 
observations of these conversations I worked out that they almost always 
followed a particular process/formula. I like to call it the Gentleman&#8217;s Selling 
Formula and it would go something like this: </p>
<p class="quote">Current Situation (CS) &gt; Ideal Future Situation (IFS) &gt; Gaps between CS &amp; IFS 
(GCI)&gt; Suggest Solution (SS) </p>
<p class="quote">i.e. CS + IFS &#8211; GCI + SS = WIN </p>
<p>These gentlemen would start with finding out as much as possible about what 
was happening &#8216;now&#8217; in their prospects world. By doing this it showed that they 
where genuinely interested in their prospects business. Then they would have 
their prospect paint them a picture of how they wanted their business to be, 
getting them excited about their Ideal Future Situation. Then ask them where 
they think the Gaps are in getting them from where they are now to where they 
want to be and if those Gaps are holes that their services/products can fill 
then it is just a matter of saying &#8220;Hey, great news!! Those gaps your talking 
about, we&#8217;ve got some great options that will fill them in and have you on that 
path to achieving that IFS we talked about&#8230;&#8221;. </p>
<p>Whereas &#8216;the rest&#8217; would pretty much follow the complete opposite to that 
formula, something like this: SS + GCI &#8211; IFS &#8211; CS = LOSS. They would first talk 
about how great their services/products were (Suggested Solution) and when that 
would get them no where they would usually say &#8220;Ok then, why don&#8217;t you tell me 
your problems are then&#8221; (Gaps) which would make the prospect feel uncomfortable 
and unsure. Then, if they are allowed, they would resort to &#8220;Just tell me what 
you want and I&#8217;ll do it&#8221; (IFS) and lastly after the prospect has walked out the 
office unimpressed and frustrated, they&#8217;re left there scratching their head 
wondering what the hell just happened (the Current Situation). </p>
<p>The last difference worth mentioning between the &#8216;Top Gentleman Sellers&#8217; and 
&#8216;the rest&#8217; was their dress style. You mightn&#8217;t think this is a big deal, but 
trust me most people DO judge a book by its cover. Unlike what I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve 
heard before and what is preached in every sales book since 1950 where you 
should dress in an impeccable suit and tie every time you walk out the door, 
these &#8216;gentlemen&#8217; sellers would dress more so for the situation, not for 
themselves. They would take notice or research how the person dressed with whom 
they were meeting with and if they knew the person was quite casual in their 
dress sense, then they too would dress quite casual (maybe just slightly better) 
alternatively if they knew that the person usually dons a full suit, tie and 
cuffs everywhere they go then they too would do so. It wasn&#8217;t so much that they 
wanted to look good, it was more the fact that they wanted the person they were 
meeting with to feel comfortable. </p>
<p>So in summary here&#8217;s the toolbox you&#8217;ll need to become a top performing 
&#8216;gentleman&#8217; seller: </p>
<ol>
	<li>Ask and Listen. I know this is simple, but just try an make more of a 
conscious effort to do so. Don&#8217;t just take &#8216;surface&#8217; answers, dig deeper. The 
big nuggets of gold are always deeper.</li>
	<li>Modest Confidence. Confidence comes from planning. Before you meet with a 
prospect or client plan out how you want the conversation to travel and remember 
the Gentleman&#8217;s Selling Formula: CS + IFS &#8211; GCI + SS = WIN</li>
	<li>Dress for the situation not for yourself. Think about who you are meeting with 
and how they would want to see you.</li>
	</ol>
