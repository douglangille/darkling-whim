9 Sales Steps that Influence a Buying Decision</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The steps of a buying decision differ from the steps of a sale. The sales 
model has no way to influence the private decisions and buy-in issues that 
buyers must address before they can buy. </p>
<p>Buyers live in a &#8216;system&#8217; that maintains their Identified Problem (or &#8216;pain&#8217;) 
over time, creating workarounds that become part of the system and, well, 
comfortable. Indeed, if the buyer really needed to make a change, they would 
have done so already. It&#8217;s only when a group of dedicated, internal change 
agents are willing to push the river, that a purchase is even considered. </p>
<p>Before buyers can buy, there must be buy-in to the proposed change, a plan 
that minimizes disruption, and a way to foster agreement between the people, 
policies and relationships that touch a new solution. A buying decision is far 
more complex than just fixing a problem. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve developed Buying Facilitation? &#8211; a decision navigation model that is an 
add-on to sales and helps buyers bring together the right people and issues - to 
enable agreement and ensure change procedures are in place to make a purchase. 
Here are a few Buying Facilitation? skills to use with sales: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>9 STEPS </h2>
<h3>1. Help the gatekeeper discover who your best point of contact would be. 
</h3>
<p>Don&#8217;t try to &#8216;get through&#8217; the gatekeeper. She knows the best person to 
connect you with. And don&#8217;t attempt to &#8216;go to the top.&#8217; The top person usually 
delegates to the appropriate people. Ask for the CEO&#8217;s assistant, and she&#8217;ll get 
you to the right people. Question: who is in control of the conversation &#8211; you? 
or the Gatekeeper? </p>
<h3>2. Use Facilitative Questions to get into rapport and have buyers begin to 
examine how/if/why they would consider changing their status quo. </h3>
<p>Until or unless prospects determine to make a change and get all appropriate 
folks on board to buy-in to change and ensure there is minimal disruption, it 
doesn&#8217;t matter whether </p>
<p>you can see their need, your solution is perfect, they think they need 
you/your solution, they love your solution, price, personality, etc. IT&#8217;S NOT 
ABOUT YOU. Do you need to be working out more? It&#8217;s not about the gym. </p>
<p>Here is a Facilitative Question I use to start conversations: How would you 
know if it were time to add new sales skills to the ones you&#8217;re already offering 
your sales folks? This question helps them think about necessary steps and new 
choices they must consider. </p>
<p>Remember: discussing solutions and needs assessment are irrelevant at this 
early stage. Facilitative Questions help the BUYER see the whole picture of what 
is going on strategically and tactically. Until or unless they know how to 
manage their system first, they will take no action. This is where buyers go 
when you&#8217;re sitting and waiting. </p>
<h3>3. Lead prospects/buyers through the systems issues they must consider in order 
to determine how any proposed change will disrupt their status quo. </h3>
<p>Facilitative Questions and Presumptive Summaries are used to help buyers look 
at their status quo with an unbiased eye. No matter what their &#8216;need&#8217; or 
&#8216;problem&#8217; if they don&#8217;t think they can change in a way that maintains systems 
congruence, they will do nothing. Remember: the buyer&#8217;s 
environment/culture/system has lived with the Identified Problem until now, and 
can continue to do so. If they had known how to resolve it differently, they 
would have. </p>
<h3>4. Facilitate prospect&#8217;s discovery of what sorts of strategic issues they must 
manage to get folks on board with potential change. </h3>
<p>There are 3 levels of decisions necessary: systems, strategic, and tactical. 
Addressing them in this order is optimal although it&#8217;s usually an iterative 
process. </p>
<h3>5. Lead prospects/buyers through tactical issues they must manage before they 
can choose a solution. </h3>
<p>Once they determine that </p>
<ol>
	<li>their system would be willing to shift to add something/change/resolve 
something, </li>
	<li>their rules, relationships, people, are willing to change, </li>
	<li>they know 
how to shift congruently to minimize disruption, </li>
</ol>
<p>they will then be willing to 
bring in a new solution. Until or unless their status quo is reconfigured in a 
way that the insiders are willing to support, they will do nothing: the risk to 
their functioning is too high. Hence the longer-than-necessary sales cycle. </p>
<p>Buyers must do this with you or without you &#8211; so it might as well be with 
you. </p>
<h3>6. Help the prospect choose the members of the Buying Decision Team. </h3>
<p>Help buyers recognize the right people to include. Usually they don&#8217;t know 
who it will be until way down the road, much like you don&#8217;t know all the trials 
you&#8217;ll face before you start a move. </p>
<h3>7. Discuss how your solution fits with the internal issues that they must 
manage. </h3>
<p>This step is about melding your solution with the entire range of issues they 
have to manage internally, including the people, policies, and relationships.
</p>
<h3>8. Discuss/present your solution and show the prospect/buyer how it would fit 
with their need/problem. </h3>
<p>Once they do all of the above and get appropriate buy-in to manage change, 
they will know how and when to buy, and you can discuss needs/solutions 
according to their buy-in issues. </p>
<h3>9. Follow up to see if there is anything you can do to help the prospect/buyer 
decide to purchase. </h3>
<p>This is part of a good sales job, of course. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>SALES TACTICS THAT ARE NO LONGER NECESSARY </h2>
<h3>Make an appointment to get in front of the prospect </h3>
<p>This is a hold-over from another era. Until buyers put together their 
decision team and figure out how to change without disruption, your bright shiny 
face and the efficacy of your solution is irrelevant. You can do all of the 
above without meeting a client. And then, when you get there, the entire Buying 
Decision Team will be there and you wouldn&#8217;t have wasted any time/visits. </p>
<h3>Manage objections and differentiate yourself from the competition. </h3>
<p>The sales model creates objections because it pushes data/solution info 
against a &#8216;closed system.&#8217; When you hear an objection, it&#8217;s merely the system 
defending itself against change and nothing whatsoever about your solution. Once 
you teach the system how to manage buy-in without disruption, there are no 
objections. </p>
<p>80% of your prospects will buy within 2 years &#8211; but not from you. The time it 
takes them to manage the buying decision to ensure there will be no disruption 
is the length of the sales cycle. You can either sit and wait for them to do it, 
or you can learn Buying Facilitation? and become the GPS system to help them 
navigate. Would you rather sell? or help someone buy? </p>
