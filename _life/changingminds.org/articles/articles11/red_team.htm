The Red Team: A Simple But Effective Method to Improve Mission Planning</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: James D Murphy</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The May 1, 2011 mission to find Osama Bin Laden has become one of the most 
celebrated military mission planning successes in recent memory due to the 
utilization of a little-known and seldom-used practice called the Red Team. </p>
<p>The mission was a daring raid executed by the courageous members of the U.S. 
Navy SEAL DEVGRU, also known as SEAL Team Six, especially when considering the 
potentially disastrous political and diplomatic consequences that would have 
occurred had the mission failed. In spite of the dangers, the odds, and the loss 
of one of the two Blackhawk helicopters that delivered the SEALs to the target, 
the mission to get Bin Laden was an extraordinary mission planning success that 
continues to inspire awe. The Bin Laden mission was executed by some of the 
finest warriors that history has ever known. However, aside from skill in the 
profession of arms, it was the overall tactical planning process that went into 
the mission that provides an important lesson for planners in all fields - in 
military, business, or in everyday life. </p>
<h2>The Overconfidence Bias </h2>
<p>We fall in love with the plans we make. Mission planning is much like giving 
birth to a child. When the plan is complete, whether developed by an individual 
or a collaborative team, the planners can step back and congratulate themselves 
on the genius of the plan that they have created -- such overconfidence is one 
of many cognitive biases we humans fall prey to. </p>
<p>This is why the practice of utilizing a Red Team is necessary. A Red Team is 
a simple means to overcome the overconfidence bias and the theory of 
&quot;groupthink,&quot; the need for groups to seek conformity and unanimity in planning 
and decision making. The mission planning effort that went into the Bin Laden 
mission was the detailed product of many different planners, but that alone was 
not enough to ensure success. The tactical planning process had to be subjected 
to a Red Team. </p>
<h2>The Role of the Red Team </h2>
<p>For the Bin Laden mission, military planners invited an outside group of 
experts who were previously unaware of the plan and had not taken part in the 
mission planning process to comprise what we call a Red Team. A Red Team 
examines a plan and offers frank criticism of the plan without bias. The Red 
Team's purpose is to expose flaws or weaknesses in the tactical planning process 
- to test the plan with dispassionate reason and respectfully offer detailed 
criticism. However, the planners must accept the criticism humbly, without 
commenting or defending the plan. It is vital that the planners involved are 
able to accept and incorporate this criticism, or the practice of utilizing a 
Red Team will be rendered moot. </p>
<p>Historical Examples of Mission Planning Using Red Teams </p>
<p>The Red Team is not a new concept. In 1962, faced with the threat of Soviet 
nuclear missiles in Cuba, President John F. Kennedy utilized a form of the Red 
Team to great success. He had suffered a terrible and embarrassing debacle in 
the botched Bay of Pigs Invasion and Kennedy was not going to allow such an 
error in mission planning to happen again. He began by dividing his Executive 
Committee in half and tasked each of the two groups to argue for one of two 
primary options to deal with the threat. One group argued for a naval blockade 
and the other for an air strike. Kennedy then had the groups switch positions 
and critique the other group's proposal. The last step in Kennedy's tactical 
planning process was to ask his brother, Robert Kennedy, and one of his close 
counsels, Ted Sorenson, to act as a Red Team on each group's proposal. The 
result was one of the most masterfully played moves during the Cold War - a 
naval blockade that forced Soviet withdrawal of nuclear missiles from Cuba. </p>
<p>The Red Team has been utilized with great success in the U.S. military. 
During the Gulf War mission planning effort, planners employed this practice, 
asking Red Team members to defeat a proposed plan. Planners then took the 
weaknesses exposed by the Red Team and improved the tactical planning process, 
making plans tighter and nearly foolproof. The result was a successful war 
fought on foreign soil to expel invaders in just five weeks - a mission 
accomplished with minimal loss of life and destruction of property. Like the Bin 
Laden mission, the Gulf War met with success through the use of a tactical 
planning process that included Red Teams. </p>
<h2>Eliminate the Fear of Personal Attacks When Using a Red Team </h2>
<p>One might think that it takes courage to employ a Red Team. It is hard to 
expose your &quot;baby&quot; to such criticism, as we naturally view critiques as a 
personal attack. However, when performed correctly, a Red Team need not invoke 
fear of personal attack. The secret to successfully incorporating this practice 
into the mission planning process is to diffuse resistance to personal criticism 
before the Red Team critique takes place. Individuals must incorporate the idea 
that &quot;it is not 'me' that is being assaulted by critics, it is 'us.'&quot; </p>
<p>To further ameliorate the sense of offense and fear that the Red Team may 
create, this part of the tactical planning process should take a simple, 
disciplined and respectful structure. Invite the Red Team to sit down while 
someone from the mission planning team briefs the plan to the room. After the 
plan has been detailed, the Red Team should then have an opportunity to ask 
clarifying questions. After all questions have been asked, the Red Team should 
offer criticisms of the mission planning process in a round-robin fashion until 
all concerns have been voiced. </p>
<p>Offering and accepting criticism is much easier when it is communicated 
correctly. All members of the Red Team should begin their critical remarks with 
a statement such as, &quot;Have you considered...&quot; Furthermore, all responses to Red 
Team criticisms should be grateful, beginning with statements such as, &quot;Thank 
you for your input.&quot; There should not be discussion or defense. The mission 
planning team will have a natural tendency to want to argue with the Red Team 
about their tactical planning process and will have to avoid the urge to defend 
the plan and learn to respond with gratitude. </p>
<p>Because the Red Team has no prior knowledge of the tactical planning process 
and also lacks knowledge of the considerations that were part of the mission 
planning effort, beginning each comment and criticism with the aforementioned 
&quot;Have you considered...&quot; statement is vital. This relieves the mission planning 
team of the need to respond and also relieves the Red Team from concern that a 
comment or criticism will not be valid. After pointing out the flaws and 
weaknesses in the tactical planning process, the Red Team should depart and the 
mission planning team should begin incorporating the newfound criticism to 
better the plan as a whole. </p>
<p>The Red Team utilized during the Bin Laden mission provided invaluable input 
as a critical component of the mission planning process. This practice can 
improve any plan, in any context and in any company. The best part is that 
utilizing the practice does not take much time, as a Red Team requires a minimum 
of only three or four members to discuss the tactical planning process. The 
meeting is also short, at approximately 30 - 60 minutes - and the results can 
make a world of difference. </p>
