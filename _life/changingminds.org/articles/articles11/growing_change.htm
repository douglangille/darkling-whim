Growing with Change</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Jim Clemmer</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span lang="EN-CA">Change happens. And while we can't control much of the 
world changing around us, we can control how we respond. We can choose to 
anticipate and embrace changes, or resist them. Resisting change is like trying 
to push water upstream. Generally we're quick to point to others who resist 
change. It's much harder to recognize or admit to our own change resistance.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-CA">Some people call change &quot;progress&quot; and celebrate the 
improvements that it brings. Others curse those same changes and wish for the 
good old days. Same changes, different responses. The choice is ours: We can be 
leaders, or we can be followers.</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN-CA">Embrace Change</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-CA">To embrace change, we need to concentrate on five areas.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-CA"><b>1. Focus on a vision. </b>Our vision or imagination guides 
everything we do. Helen Keller once said, &quot;Nothing is more tragic than someone 
who has sight, but no vision.&quot; We can't leave the incredible magnetic power of 
vision unharnessed. Our thoughts often pull us toward the reasons why we can't 
succeed, rather than the many reasons we can. To increase our effectiveness, we 
need to consciously attract into our lives what we truly want. We need to ensure 
the picture of our future is what we prefer, not the dark images of our fears, 
doubts, and insecurities. Personal, team, or organizational improvement starts 
with &quot;imagineering.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-CA">We find what we focus upon. Whether I think my world is 
full of richness and opportunity or garbage and despair &#8212; I am right. It's 
exactly like that because that's my point of focus. Our vision is led by a set 
of core values. Without a strong set of core values, passion is weak and 
commitment is soft. We're more likely to lead ourselves from the outside in, 
rather than the inside out. Core values provide a context for continuous growth 
and development that takes us toward our dreams. Our core values project forward 
to become our vision. How we see the world is what we project from ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-CA"><b>2. Choose your outlook. </b>We reach another milestone in our 
growth when we accept responsibility for our emotions. We choose to lose our 
temper. We choose to become jealous. We choose to harbor hatred. It's much 
easier to give in to the Victimitis Virus. It's less painful to believe that 
anger, jealousy, or bitterness are somebody else's fault or beyond our control. 
But that makes us prisoners of our destructive emotions. We hold grudges, let 
resentments build, and become cynical. We stress ourselves out. We stew in our 
own deadly juices.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-CA">Holding on to destructive emotions is slow suicide. 
Studies show that stress from negative emotions presents a more dangerous risk 
factor for cancer and heart disease than smoking cigarettes or high cholesterol 
foods. We must take responsibility for our actions in response to circumstances 
for which we are not responsible. The only thing we can control is ourselves, so 
when we choose our thoughts, we are choosing our future.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-CA"><b>3. Seek authenticity. </b>To create something we must 
be something. For example, becoming a parent is easy; being one is tough. We 
can't teach our kids self-discipline unless we are self-disciplined. We can't 
help build strong teams unless we are strong team players ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-CA">This timeless principle applies to every facet of our 
lives. We can't help develop a close community if we're not a good neighbor. We 
can't enjoy a happy marriage if we're not a loving partner. We won't have a 
supportive network of friends or colleagues until we're a supportive friend or 
collaborative colleague. David Whyte writes, &quot;All things change when we do.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-CA">The big (and often painful) question is: What do I need to 
change about me to help change them? Instead of just wishing for a change of 
circumstance, I may need a change of character. Good intentions are useless if 
they stop there. One big difference between most people and authentic leaders, 
is action. Real leaders make it happen.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-CA"><b>4. Commit ourselves with discipline. </b>A key difference 
between real leaders and those who struggle to get by, is self-discipline. As 
Confucius wrote, &quot;The nature of people is always the same; it is their habits 
that separate them.&quot; Successful people have formed the habits of doing those 
things that most people don't want to do.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-CA">Good and bad habits are tiny, daily choices that 
accumulate. Like a child that grows a little each day, our tiny choices 
accumulate without much notice. By the time we realize we have either a good or 
a bad habit, the habit has us.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-CA">Most of our daily choices are made automatically without 
even thinking about them. To change our habits, we first need to be aware of 
them. Then we need to work backward from the habit to the daily practices that 
form it. To change the habit, we need to change those practices.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-CA">Still, if discipline is a key to success, the fact is that 
most people would rather pick the lock. Less successful people can't pass up 
instant gratification in favor of some prospective benefit. It's much easier to 
live for the moment and let tomorrow take care of itself. But it takes 
discipline to forego the immediately pleasurable, for an investment in the 
future.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-CA">Discipline means having the vision to see the long-term 
picture and keep things in balance. A Chinese proverb teaches: &quot;If you are 
patient in one moment of anger, you will escape a hundred days of sorrow.&quot; We 
all want more patience &#8212; and we want it now! Most of us would like to be 
delivered from temptation, but we'd like it to stay in touch. Discipline is what 
keeps us going when the excitement of first beginning a task is long past.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-CA"><b>5. Continually grow and develop. </b>Most people see others as 
they are; a leader sees them as they could be. Leaders see beyond the current 
problems and limitations to help others see their own possibilities. It's a key 
part of their own growth and development.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-CA">We continue to grow when we help others grow and develop. 
The cycle of growth and development has two parts, and the first is our own 
growth and development, since we can't develop others if our own growth is 
stunted. These two parts depend upon and support each other. We develop 
ourselves while we're developing others. By developing others, we develop 
ourselves. It's a growth cycle that spirals forever upward.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-CA">Another part of the growth process is seeking to be more 
effective. As the pace of change quickens, it's easier to fall into the trap of 
confusing busyness with effectiveness. Like the wood-cutter who's too busy 
chopping to stop and sharpen his ax, we get caught up in a frantic pace that may 
be taking us to the wrong destination. Reflecting on our progress is as rare as 
a proud man asking for directions. But to be more effective, we need to step 
back, take time out, and assess our direction. It will help us grow and keep up 
with change.</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN-CA">Making Choices</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-CA">Change forces choices. If we're on the grow, we'll embrace 
many changes and find the positive in them. It's all in where we choose to put 
our focus. Even change that hits us in the side of the head as a major crisis 
can be full of growth opportunities &#8212; if we choose to look for them.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-CA">Many people who have weathered a serious crisis, look back 
years later and point to that event as a significant turning point. Most would 
rather not go through that pain again, but it was a key part of their growth.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-CA">Crisis can be a danger that weakens or destroys us. Or 
crisis can be a growth opportunity. The choice is ours. Whichever we choose, 
we're right about that crisis. We make it our reality.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-CA">The point is, change is life. Successfully dealing with 
change means choosing to grow and develop continuously. Failing to grow is 
failing to live.</span></p>
