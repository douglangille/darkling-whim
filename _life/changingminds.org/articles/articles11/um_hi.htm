Um Hi</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Doug Martin</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Um Hi. My name is Doug &#8230; and I&#8217;m &#8230; an Optimist&#8221;. &#8220;Hi Doug&#8221;, the group says 
in unison. </p>
<p>Deep down, I always knew the day would come. An optimist intervention. You 
cannot be so out of step with the world and expect no one to notice. My optimism 
started early, somewhere around my 4th birthday, so you could say I&#8217;ve been a 
lifer of sorts. I&#8217;m not blaming my parents for always encouraging me, 
challenging me to do my best, letting me explore and learn. They didn&#8217;t know 
better, it was a different time. </p>
<p>If you nip &#8220;Early Optimism&#8221; in the bud, like so many caring parents are able 
to do, well then, your kids have a great chance at conformity. I vaguely 
remember the other parents calling to their children, as we ran around like 
mini-maniacs on someone&#8217;s beaten down front lawn playing tag, hide and go seek 
or some other form of potentially destructive behavior to &#8220;Simmer Down&#8221; or &#8220;OK 
Jerry, let&#8217;s take a time out&#8221;. One by one, the other kids got picked off and had 
their enthusiasm neutered. </p>
<p>It was for the best actually. Because as kids move from being regular kids to 
being school kids, diminished enthusiasm fits perfectly into the system&#8217;s plan. 
It takes some 12 or so years of pretty intense effort to breed out the banshee 
in us, but clearly it can be done. And for the most part, applying negative 
consequences to excitable behavior, or open expression of thought and action, 
eventually nets the systems desired result, docile little robots. </p>
<p>Of course this can&#8217;t be done completely alone and during the invariable 
parent/teacher meetings where it will be suggested that added at-home attention 
will be needed to help curb such spinning out of control situations as running 
through the playground, or squeals of delight in reaction to an announced field 
trip. It&#8217;s a team effort after all. My folks, bless their hearts, simply didn&#8217;t 
have the discipline to stifle me completely. Sure we had little chats about 
disrupting others and not getting them involved in my excitement, maybe stop 
organizing running races, that sort of thing. But they just didn&#8217;t have the 
skills to beat out my optimistic habit. </p>
<p>In truth, I liked how it felt. Sure there was the crash at the end of the 
day, when I&#8217;d fall exhausted into my bed and dream about doing it all again 
tomorrow. But I honestly, didn&#8217;t see the damage I was doing to myself. As I got 
older, I began figuring out that my optimism didn&#8217;t impress the good folks at 
the schools I was attending. And naturally, by my mid-teens, I knew I had to 
conceal it, for the good of eventually getting out of the system. I had to play 
ball, and play ball I did. For the most part, I appeared to be like most 
everyone else. But in truth, I had become a closet optimist. There, I said it.
</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t easy concealing it either. Man, I tell you, once the optimism bug 
is in; it is really hard to hide. I found myself sneaking off to parks or the 
base of tree trunks and just letting my brain envelop ideas, schemes, concepts, 
and other dreams of great achievement. Playing out each idea in my mind, 
unconfined to their meaning. Unorganized random thoughts of adventures in 
business, travel or change. </p>
<p>Although I can admit it now, I even got part-time jobs. That was a little 
brazen actually; someone might notice that, so I got three and sometimes four 
jobs, just so people wouldn&#8217;t see me too dedicated to one. If they saw me at one 
of my jobs, they&#8217;d just think it wasn&#8217;t too much and leave me alone. </p>
<p>As I look back, I see my dad particularly, was an enabler. He simply didn&#8217;t 
have the strength to say no to me when I asked for a rare ride to work, or some 
advice about what to do with the cash I was making. Not once did he raise his 
hands and say, &#8220;Stop this insanity&#8221; as I sat with him in my early 20&#8217;s jabbering 
on about some great new business idea I had. Not once. He&#8217;d just sit there, 
smiling, asking me logical questions and then always end with some nutty saying 
like &#8220;If anyone can do it, you can Doug. You can do anything&#8221;. He was a crazy 
dad, but I loved him anyway. </p>
<p>Once you become an adult, of course, you go unchecked. You are free to dream 
and believe and pursue any ridiculous idea that crosses your mind. I quickly 
became oblivious to just how bad the world was around me. Living in my little 
fog of optimism. And naturally, happiness loves company, and so over the years, 
you ferret out other optimists. You get together and form little groups, like 
the Chamber of Commerce. You sneak out and meet each other of for coffees in the 
morning and share ideas. Oh yeah, you do that. All the while, looking over your 
shoulder. You know they are there, watching &#8230; waiting for just the right time to 
swoop in with pessimism. To set you straight, shake some reality into you. </p>
<p>Over time, you simply stop caring what they think and do what you do anyway. 
But they are always watching you. They watch you get all those undeserved 
promotions, they watch you move into different neighborhoods, they watch you 
drive better cars and they watch with utter distain, at your complete lack of 
parenting skills while you encourage the cycle to continue by letting your kids 
express their inner optimist. </p>
<p>It took fifty-five years, but concerned friends finally were able to bring 
clarity to my otherwise optimistic world. I&#8217;m embarrassed to say, I had no idea 
how bad the economy was, how corrupt the political system, how opportunity had 
vanished. And you can imagine how stunned I was to learn that all these things 
and many many more, have apparently been plaguing my life for years and years. I 
just didn&#8217;t know. Or didn&#8217;t care, I guess. </p>
<p>So as I looked into the eyes of my new group, so filled with concern as I 
took my first steps toward understanding or even embracing pessimism, a rush of 
my life as an optimist washed through my mind, all the highs and of course, all 
the highs. I realized, I couldn&#8217;t be cured. There is no solution for me. I&#8217;m too 
deep into it. I wrecked my kids with selfish doses of encouragement, so deeply 
ingrained they will never surface from the abyss of optimism, and I am probably 
guilty of sucking a few others in, along my winding and sorted path. </p>
<p>So as their harmonic &#8220;Hi Doug&#8221; still reverberated in the air, I spoke softly 
and humbly &#8220;I&#8217;m an optimist, my dad was an optimist, my kids are optimists, most 
people I cherish in my life are optimists. Let me be. Find others to enlighten 
about the crazy state of reality. I need to be with my people.&#8221; </p>
<p>We may be few, we may be delirious, and we may be kidding ourselves. But I 
wouldn&#8217;t want it any other way. </p>
<p>If you are secretly an optimist and know others, send them this story. <br>
