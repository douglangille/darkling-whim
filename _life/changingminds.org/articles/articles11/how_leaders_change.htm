How do Leaders create change that really works?</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Jim Rickard</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span LANG="EN"><font SIZE="2">
<p class="quote"><i>&quot;Progress is impossible without change; and those who cannot 
change their minds cannot change anything.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; -- </i>George Bernard Shaw (1856-1950)</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it most of us hate change! We like it when we are comfortably 
ensconced within our safe domains and are content to maintain the status quo. 
This is the challenge that any leader faces who needs to create change within an 
organization; in order for it to survive and to thrive in today&#8217;s business 
environment. A quick internet search or reading the Wall Street Journal will 
give a listing of once vibrant businesses that were household names and have now 
been thrown onto the bone pile of dead or dying companies. Why did that happen? 
They failed to react to current market conditions quickly enough to capitalize 
on growth and market share and took a short term view of returns versus the long 
term view. Their leadership was either unconcerned about change, blind to the 
change in the market conditions or wrongly decided that their product was 
unassailable. </p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s, visionary leader Steve Jobs (1955-2011) was able to create change in 
his business environment that has transformed the way we work, think, problem 
solve and communicate in the world. The business culture of constantly learning 
and trying new things that Jobs created will help to carry new Apple inventions 
and innovations into the foreseeable future. Steve Jobs was and is universally 
recognized for his brilliance in successfully creating change within his 
organization and the world during his time. There was another giant in the world 
of change, not as well known to the general public, whose ideas and theories are 
still impacting the business world by the name of Kurt Lewin (1890-1947). </p>
<p>Kurt Lewin was born in a small village in Prussia that is now part of Poland 
and was one of four children. He served in the German army in WWI and was 
wounded in action; Lewin received his PhD in psychology while he was still 
serving in the military. His contributions in change theory, action research and 
action learning helped him to become known as the &quot;father of organizational 
development&quot;. 1 Organizational development (OD) is a method of changing the 
culture within a business by focusing on ways to adapt and solve problems 
through encouraging openness in communication, fair treatment and respect for 
worker autonomy (Daft 2007). In order for this to be successful senior 
management must endorse the change action and support and enforce it at every 
level within the organization. </p>
<p>Lewin&#8217;s theory of change (unfreeze-change-refreeze) 2 is a three step model 
that helps consultants/leaders to implement culture changes within an 
organization. The idea is simple enough and whether we realize it or not we have 
all used it at some point. Think of trying to water a particular spot in your 
yard with a faulty water sprinkler, it does not water where you want it to, so 
you have to make a correction (unfreeze) then change the direction it faces 
(change), then secure it to water in the direction you want it to go (refreeze). 
This is the same idea involved in implementing change within an organization 
except now instead of an inanimate water sprinkler you are dealing with people 
with real thoughts, feelings and emotions. Depending upon the way they have 
learned of the approaching change (surprised or well informed) they may react 
with resistance or with anticipation. </p>
<p class="quote"><i>&quot;Successful change can only happen when employees are willing to devote the 
time and energy needed to reach new goals, as well as endure possible stress and 
hardship&quot; </i>3 (Daft 2007).</p>
<p>When people are properly informed of change and most importantly when they 
learn, &quot;how does this change affect me&quot;? they are less likely to be resistant to 
the change if they have a full understanding of the change. They can then see 
the benefits for themselves, as well as for the organization. By being properly 
prepared for change and coming to accept the change, employees are in a position 
to actually commit to the change themselves on a personal level. At this point 
the change becomes a permanent part of the organizational culture and the change 
cycle can begin again if, and when, needed. </p>
<p>Perhaps you have heard the old saying &quot;a clean broom sweeps clean&quot;. Some 
leaders operate under this principle and institute radical changes within an 
organization when they first arrive in a company; changing everything from top 
to bottom and sometimes this is necessary. These types of radical change will 
perhaps involve major restructuring of an organization by a corporate-turnaround 
specialist. Stephen F. Cooper is such a person who has been brought in to 
restructure differing companies like Enron, Laidlaw (Greyhound bus) and Krispy 
Kreme to name a few 4. Leaders sometimes operate under the principle of 
incremental change or the use of small changes over time. Toyota and Google are 
two companies that operate under continuous incremental change and they are 
constantly learning from their employees who manufacture and engineer their 
products 5. </p>
<p>Professor Richard Daft, of Vanderbilt University states that there are five 
elements involved in successful change and that if any of the elements are 
missing then the change will not be successful: 1) ideas, 2) need, 3) adoption, 
4) implementation, 5) resources. </p>
<p>Without good ideas continually being generated from within an organization or 
company it will not survive in today&#8217;s highly competitive market. Unless there 
is a need for change within an organization then even good ideas will not be 
considered if there is no sense of urgency. Adoption takes place when the 
decision makers agree there is an urgent need to move ahead with the idea. 
Implementation follows adoption when the organization actually uses a new idea, 
technique or behavior. Without resources no idea will be able to make it through 
the selection process in any organization. (Daft 2007) Good change requires time 
and resources and does not happen in a vacuum. Change leaders are able to 
articulate a vision and create a sense of urgency and trust within an 
organization for proactive change before a crisis looms; with the change then 
being driven by reaction to market forces. </p>
<p>A wise man I know was fond of saying, &quot;Things like this don&#8217;t just happen&quot; 
and he was right. Wise planning, earning the trust of stakeholders and 
thoughtful considerations by leaders go into making sure that an organization is 
able to implement successful change within its system. Good planning and open 
lines of communication will help to increase the commitment of employees at the 
grass roots level who will help to ensure that actual change takes place. 
Leaders are unable to create change by themselves; without the commitment of 
employees who will actually implement the change within an organization, the 
process is unlikely to be successful. If you want to be a leader who can help to 
create change you first have to start with trust, integrity and open 
communication. </p>
