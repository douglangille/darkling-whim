<h1>The Benefit of Safety Debriefing &#8211; Developing a Culture of Learning through Lessons Learned</h1>

The Benefit of Safety Debriefing &#8211; Developing a Culture of Learning through Lessons Learned</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: James D. Murphy</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations must possess both formal and informal learning structures to 
adapt and thrive, and safety debriefing skills learned from a qualified 
consulting firm is just such a structure that is a necessity in any rapidly 
changing environment. Anyone who has not recognized the need for continuous 
learning in modern business has missed out on one of the most significant 
lessons learned in recent decades. The forces of rapid global change can render 
limited professional skill sets obsolete almost overnight. Moreover, 
organizations that fail to continuously revise their assumptions about their 
operating environment (i.e. market) or learn about trends via outside consulting 
will soon face obsolescence or irrelevance. <br>
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the full spectrum of benefits derived from proper safety 
debriefing is not widely understood. The most obvious benefit of debriefing is 
its basic product, the lesson learned. But, this is only one of many benefits. 
Proper debriefing training with a consulting firm provides a powerful and 
essential structure for maintaining the capacity to learn and accelerate 
experience. </p>
<p>What are the benefits of proper debriefing learned from a consulting firm? 
They are numerous and fall into two main categories. First, there are the 
lessons learned &#8211; the discreet, tangible products that emerge directly from the 
debrief process. Then there are the leadership, cultural, and intangible 
benefits that arise from the consistent practice of debriefing. </p>
<h2>Tangible Benefits of Debriefing </h2>
<p>First, safety debriefing formally concludes a task or project. Today, one 
often hears the phrase &quot;closing the loop&quot;. Although it's obvious and simple, one 
should not underestimate the significance of seeking closure on a task or 
project. When you work with a consulting firm specializing in debriefing, you'll 
learn it is a satisfying and productive means of &quot;closing the loop&quot;. It allows 
us to confront what has or has not been accomplished and move on. And, when 
safety debriefing is performed regularly, it keeps the organization focused on 
the present and the future rather than the past. </p>
<p>Second, a rigorous debriefing process seeks root causes in order to construct 
&quot;lessons learned&quot;. It is not enough to simply ask why something succeeded or 
failed. Often there are deeply imbedded and difficult to recognize forces at 
work. Simply looking for the obvious causes (the &quot;how's&quot;) do not uncover the 
real forces (the &quot;why's&quot;). Proper debriefing training with a consulting firm 
will teach you that those harmful root causes can fester and grow to infect the 
organization if left unaddressed. Correspondingly, beneficial root causes, those 
worthy of nurturing, may die from neglect if not identified. Safety debriefing 
provides an opportunity to sort through the ambiguities in our complex 
organizations and improve at the core organizational level. <br>
</p>
<p>Third, once root causes are identified, actionable and specific &quot;lessons 
learned&quot; are developed. A good consulting firm will tell you that lessons 
learned require action to be taken, and a single individual should be 
responsible for implementing them. A lesson learned may require changes or 
amendments to existing processes, procedures, standards, rules, or regulations. 
It may require the further development of a plan or program to address the root 
cause. Or, it may simply be a list of steps for others to utilize in future 
tasks and plans. Since lessons learned are written in an explicit manner, they 
can be stored and made available for others in the future. Or, they may be 
communicated to everyone within the organization via some appropriate medium.
</p>
<p>Finally, through the lesson learned, safety debriefing learned correctly from 
a consulting firm provides a rapid and simple approach to process improvement. 
Since debriefs occur frequently, seek root causes, and produce actionable 
lessons learned, those lessons can address process improvements without the 
unnecessary and slow tedium of methods like Six Sigma. </p>
<h2>Cultural Benefits of Debriefing </h2>
<p>The implementation of frequent and organization-wide debriefing is the first 
step to changing and improving the overall organizational culture. It is an 
exercise that, like rigorous physical exercise, improves our wellbeing in many 
ways. </p>
<p>Edgar Schein, perhaps the most respected scholar on organizational culture, 
states, &quot;culture is the result of a complex group learning process.&quot; It is 
difficult to overstate the role of safety debriefing as just such a &quot;group 
learning process&quot;. Debriefing is the sacred art of learning. It is the forum in 
which we absorb 'lessons learned' from ourselves and each other &#8211; for better or 
for worse. To take charge of that process, an experienced consulting firm can 
help you ritualize it, and develop it, and take control of your organizational 
culture. As Schein has warned, if leaders don't manage their cultures, their 
cultures will manage them. </p>
<p>The kind of culture that debriefing helps develop is one of learning, 
openness, and honesty. The thorough and candid nature of proper debriefing 
exposes the truth. Safety debriefing requires an honesty that can be 
ego-bruising. But, once one gets past that truth-telling hurdle, one finds that 
such honesty and openness gained as a part of lessons learned is contagious and 
spreads to daily behaviors. One of the primary goals of consulting firms 
specializing in debriefing is to limit people from talking behind each other's 
back and instead educate employees about how to actively seek out each other's 
advice and opinions. </p>
<p>Safety debriefing also aids leaders in establishing greater trust between 
themselves and their team. When a team thoroughly discusses each other's 
contribution to the execution of a task or project they come to know each other 
and understand each other's unique challenges and obstacles. Furthermore, they 
uncover the complexities that challenge them and learn how better to assist each 
other in managing those challenges. </p>
<p>Finally, safety debriefing skills gained from a consulting firm provide 
lessons learned for organization-wide improvements. Although debriefing begins 
at the very tactical or day-to-day operations level, the practice of debriefing 
should cascade upward in the organization. The root causes that are discovered 
at each level, even when those causes may be ambiguous, can be cross-referenced 
to identify recurring root causes. For an organization as a whole, the analysis 
of recurring root causes is the most powerful continuous improvement tool it can 
possess. Such analysis provides a capacity to identify or self-diagnose a host 
of organizational weaknesses. </p>
<p>As a learning tool, and in developing a culture of learning, safety 
debriefing is essential. We live in a world of rapid and often violent change 
that we have no real capacity to predict. Lessons learned today may save us 
tomorrow, but could become irrelevant next week. And while knowledge of the real 
world is perishable, ritualistic debriefing skills learned from a credible 
consulting firm can help you stay fresh and up to date. </p>
