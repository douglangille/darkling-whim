Strategic Planning and Effects-Based Thinking: Part 1</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: James D. Murphy</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: none; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; font-size: medium; ">
<p>As the name implies, effects-based thinking (EBT) is an approach to strategic 
planning and decision making where the effects of specific actions are assessed, 
not in a narrowly defined and time-limited way, but through a perspective that 
is sensitive to broad-ranging and lasting impacts. Effects-based thinking is the 
opposite of short-sightedness or myopia.</p>
<p>Sadly, we have the ability to think about effects, yet we often don't. In our 
fast-paced personal and work lives we tend to think more about today's issues 
rather than tomorrow's. Strategic planning objectives get pushed back further 
and further to accommodate those immediate concerns. Modern organizations tend 
to exacerbate our naturally myopic tendencies by planning in small executive 
teams and passing down narrowly defined objectives and goals with little 
connectedness to overall goals. Ironically, narrow strategic planning sparks our 
natural capacity for effects-based thinking. In the wake of some failed 
corporate plan, the water cooler conversations buzz with effects-based 
criticisms like, &quot;Didn't they realize that was going to happen?&quot; or &quot;I saw that 
coming a mile away.&quot;</p>
<p>To some extent we are all effects-based thinkers. If you ever said to 
yourself, &quot;I'm not going to stay up to watch the rest of this game because I 
won't get enough sleep and I have a busy day tomorrow.&quot; Or, if you decided to 
enroll in graduate school to get an MBA so that you would have better career 
options, then you are certainly thinking about effects. In this sense, 
effects-based thinking is a fundamental human trait in our strategic planning 
processes. We envision some future or some goal, or we analyze some set of 
choices or actions and we think forward through a chain of cause and effect to 
make decisions. Thinking about effects is part of our nature as humans.</p>
<p>However, few individuals or organizations utilize effects-based thinking 
systemically. Such an organized, process-oriented approach is what we mean by 
effects-based thinking. We partially define effects-based thinking as<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><i>strategic 
planning and decision-making directed to shape an organization's picture of the 
future</i>. This is only a partial definition because we must additionally 
consider what we know about complex systems - that they are inherently 
unpredictable and subject to rapid, even destructive change. Furthermore, 
actions can produce unpredictable effects and unintended consequences within 
complex systems - even with a comprehensive strategic planning initiative. In 
complexity, the cause and effect sequence will always have some degree of 
ambiguity. Unfortunately, we're stuck with the fact that no person or group of 
people has completely reliable predictive abilities about complex systems. We 
also know that within complex systems, root causes of effects can be obscure. 
So, even with the benefit of hindsight, we may not know precisely what forces 
are at work to yield any given effect. Therefore, we must be ever vigilant about 
what is happening around us. We must also continually assess cause and effect in 
our internal and external systems. Effects-based thinking is about more than 
just strategic planning by mentally projecting through a series of causes and 
effects. It is also about assessing the effectiveness and accuracy of our 
predictive planning. To truly think in an effects-based way requires us to think 
cyclically rather than linearly.</p>
<p>To be more accurate, effects-based thinking can be defined as<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><i>a 
continuum of strategic planning and assessing the effectiveness of actions 
directed to shape an organization's overall goals and objectives</i>. In other 
words it's &quot;how do we get what we want and how do we know we're making the right 
choices to get it&quot;. And that seems pretty simple and straightforward if it were 
not for this pesky problem within most organizations known as &quot;execution&quot;.</p>
<p>Organizations create plans that span the course of years. They call these 
plans &quot;strategies.&quot; But leaders in organizations struggle to coordinate or 
orchestrate the execution of these strategies and utilize effects-based 
thinking. One of the many reasons for this is that the strategic planning is 
often not well connected to the operational plans, or what military planners 
call &quot;tactical plans.&quot; The strategic plan often spans a period of years while 
the tactical plans may only span a period of days, weeks or a month. There is a 
missing strategic planning tier needed to bridge that gap - one that spans the 
multiple-month to multiple-year gap. Without effects-based thinking, the plans 
we carry out on a daily basis are hard to connect to the overall strategy that 
spans a year or more. In that case then, how do you measure your progress in 
support of the strategy? And, even more importantly in this rapidly changing 
complex world, how do we know our strategy is still a viable one? Complex 
phenomena obscure our ability to determine whether our chosen course is correct. 
So, what do we do? Do we just keep plugging along for months or even years until 
it becomes painfully obvious that our strategy is ineffective or needs 
adjustment, and<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><i>then</i><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>employ 
effects-based thinking?</p>
<p>In 2010, IBM produced a report about strategic planning called<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><i>Capitalizing 
on Complexity</i>. This report clearly outlined the challenges of operating in a 
highly complex world, what it called a &quot;global system of systems.&quot; In its 
conclusions, it made several recommendations, all of which agree with the 
fundamental assumptions inherent in Flawless Execution. But one in particular 
speaks directly to effects-based thinking. The report instructs the reader to: &quot;<i>Course 
correct as needed. Align a few clear metrics with objectives to identify success 
patterns, then regularly track results as part of a continual feedback loop. 
Modify actions based on what is learned<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></i>(1).&quot;</p>
<p>Effects-based thinking is about realizing that the strategic 
planning-executing continuum must be continuously revised to keep pace with 
change. It can only do this by continually assessing the effects of actions 
taken and the uncontrollable changes taking place in the market or external 
environment.</p>
<p>To understand how to implement effects-based thinking into our planning 
requires a deeper understanding of effects and how they propagate throughout 
complex systems. We also need processes to help us think more clearly in terms 
of effects. To that end, a subsequent series of articles will explore 
effects-based thinking and how it impacts strategic planning. Through that 
series we will explore a three-tiered model of effects-based thinking. We will 
also explore line-of-sight alignment, a concept that connects everyone in the 
organization to their immediate objectives and the long-range organizational 
strategic goals - all through a dedication to effects-based thinking.</p>
