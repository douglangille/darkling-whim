In praise of Socrates, mediocrity, and stability with a nod to where Plato was coming from</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Toby Jensen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Middle Choice </h3>
<p>Socrates claimed that everything in the universe is in one of three states. 
It is either in a state of growth, a state of stability, or a state of decay. 
Plato, his student, striving to improve this theory, stated that there are only 
two states: growth or decay. Nothing is ever stable. It is either growing or it 
is dying. <p>
</p>
<p>It is simple to claim there is only growth or death. People like simplicity. 
This statement also gets us off the fence. It scares us into taking action. And 
now it is time to face that fear and destroy it. It is time to take full 
responsibility and lead a more peaceful fulfilling life of work, of working 
together. <h3>
The paradox of our need for stability and variety</h3>
<p>
I once met an elderly couple who took me aside to share with me an easier way to 
live my life. It is difficult to remember where I met them. Possibly I was doing 
my laundry on a Saturday morning at the laundry mat. All I really remember was 
the light that seemed to somehow radiate from her body while at the same time 
there was a strange flat look in her eyes. We arranged to meet later to talk as 
they wanted to get to know me more after some brief chit chat. <p>
Later when I met again with the couple they offered me a ride. As they were 
elderly, I agreed to go. I was a bit nervous going with strangers in their van 
but everything turned out all right. I immediately remembered the flat look in 
her eyes, her deadly serious tone of voice, and the light that radiated from her 
body and soul. All I can remember is how flat her look was, the depth in her 
black eyes, and the light from her body and soul that radiated goodness, light, 
and satisfaction. I knew I was in trouble. I feared for what was about to happen 
and I had no idea what it was. I had only just met her and definitely hadn&#8217;t had 
time to insult her as I seemed to do with most people during that time of my 
life. All I knew was that I was going to need to defend something with my life 
and I had no idea what that was. I was confused and, well, my confusion was soon 
answered.<p>
Immediately after I was seated in their van the wife turned to me and asked my 
why I worked so hard to get into heaven. Of course it was a loaded leading 
question and I picked up on that right away. But I didn&#8217;t know where she was 
going. I managed to mumble out some rote answers concerning growth but mostly I 
was confused and taken back as to what she wanted. And then she said it. She 
stated that she was saved. She had accepted Christ and was saved and that was 
all she needed to do. She declared with a certainty and conviction that she 
didn&#8217;t need to do anything more than accept Christ as her Savior and she would 
go to heaven. And that was all she needed to do in this life.<p>
As I began to recover, my immediate thought was to expound upon my shock. I 
wanted to jump right in and express passionately and powerfully my &#8216;correct&#8217; 
truths about the advantages and need for growth. I asked some basic growth 
related questions (that are not relevant to the discourse here now) because I 
knew in that moment whom I had met. I had met a stable, good, and healthy 
couple. She had given up growth and not fallen. And I was frightened. Here she 
was the physical embodiment of having spent her lifetime without growing and 
still radiated goodness and a resemblance of joy. Man IS that he might have joy 
&#8211; I think now. NOT man grows that he might have joy. All we have to do is try 
our best and we will have satisfaction. Achievement is NOT related to 
satisfaction.<p>
Instead of continuing down a path of interrogation, I looked into her eyes. I 
was astounded and amazed. I still saw from her radiance that she was a good and 
delightful individual. In her eyes I still saw a blankness &#8211; a strange 
emptiness. I began to look for evil and found none. Anyone who knows me knows 
that when I want to be thorough I am second to none in my search. I find what I 
am looking for and I found no evil. I was scared and shaken. I trembled and my 
voice broke as I spoke. I did not know what to do as I scrambled for the elusive 
cohesive thoughts of still wanting to convince this dear couple of the &#8216;error&#8217; 
of their ways. But I knew there was no evil within this woman or her sound 
husband. She nodded her head at my perplexity &#8211; my complexity &#8211; and spoke. <p>
The woman spoke of her desire to lighten my load. She spoke of her life in 
raising her children and the satisfaction of seeing them go out into the world. 
She spoke of knowing she had done her work. She spoke of having accepted Christ 
and needing no more. She spoke knowing that she didn&#8217;t have to work anymore. She 
spoke of rest and of relief. And I knew who I was sitting in the presence of. I 
knew who she was. I knew what she had done with her life and it scared me. Then 
I proceeded to resolve my fear. It was not my right to fear for her. I did not 
even have the right to feel fear in her presence. I knew it was wrong and 
disrespectful. I knew I needed to stop and stop quickly or it may be used 
against me. This was a good woman and she deserved to be treated as such. I 
calmed myself and then watched something incredible happen.<p>
I saw this woman react to my stop. She knew that she had shaken me. She had 
thought that she was going to shake me from my growth. She wanted to lessen my 
load and increase my light as she obviously had an abundance of light. What she 
no longer had was the potential for a greater light. She had given that up and 
forgotten about it. It was this potential for always greater light that &#8216;saved&#8217; 
me. How ironic is that? The very thing that she was purporting to have no more 
need of is exactly what was given to me in that moment to move me forward. In 
acknowledging and respecting what she was I was only then given the right to 
move on. <p>
And so I saw this delightful woman react to my stop. I saw into her. I saw her 
emotional reaction. I saw her turn to be shaken. I saw just the beginning of 
doubt creep into her soul and thought. I saw her begin to shake. And then came 
one of the most astounding things I ever witnessed. I saw her stop. I saw her 
stop as I just stopped. I saw her use my stop that I had just done in the prior 
moment. And seeing her use it I saw her grow &#8211; for only an instant. She had been 
watching deeply into me to see my reaction to be ready to push home her point. 
Only now she used what I had done to stop herself. I continued to watch her. I 
thought I had freed her. I thought that this was it. I thought that she had 
changed. For I saw her grow. And for a moment I rejoiced. <p>
Then this woman ceased her growth. The same growth I had just witnessed spring 
forth into life within her. I watched her cease and desist. I watched her 
lifetime of staying where she was at come into full force and crush what she had 
just done. And she settled down. She came back into her own and was satisfied. I 
watched even the memory of what she had just done disappear. I watched the 
discomfort float away. I watched the pain seep back down. I watched the 
difficulty of moral decisions drift into oblivion. And I still saw her 
satisfied. I saw her goodness and I could not deny it. I was amazed at what I 
had just witnessed. I knew who I had met. <h3>
Is maintenance growth? </h3>
<p>
And I became uncomfortable. And I owned it. I reveled in it. I rejoiced. It was 
all I could do and it was enough. I hope that I did it without offending this 
wonderful couple too much while I waited for the ride to end. I was extended the 
pleasant offer of rest and satisfaction as a true reality and I rejected it. And 
I felt a little confused &#8211; only a little - in my joy. I had now achieved 
satisfaction in my growth and fullness of joy. For this is what it truly means 
to have a fullness of joy. <p>
To this day I still use that confusion to drive me on. I keep it close and I 
stay aware. When I forget &#8211; no worries &#8211; it comes raging back in full force and 
drives me to my knees faster than lightning striking the full oak tree into 
smithereens. And I remember. I remember the pain &#8211; the slow limited excruciating 
pain while I am on my knees. Then I remember the endless joy. The unlimited joy. 
The unlimited growth. The potential. And I live. I live in fullness, in delight, 
in wonder. And I can stand up. I can take a stand. </p>
<p>I hope I continue to remember and live from there. </p>
<h3>What separates growth from decay? Is there a buffer zone - no matter how 
small?</h3>
<p>
Thorough enjoyment, living full, achieving dreams and shouting from the rooftops 
are what await those who grow. To those who do what it takes to get the 
greatness that awaits within this life of opportunities. So grow. Grow well, 
grow in wealth, health, and all forms of success. It is the better path. It is 
the fulfillment of who we truly are and what we have in potential. But don&#8217;t put 
down stability. For it is only from stability that we can grow. If there is a 
top and a bottom there is middle. Respect it. Respect the incredible amount of 
work it takes to just maintain. Now we can distinguish that incredible amount of 
work required to only keep our place in line from the extra work of growth. 
Growth that &#8211; AT FIRST &#8211; is uncomfortable. We can achieve the self-sustaining 
work of growth to achieve lasting growth. To be able to create even life itself 
that will one day stand on its own within its own and for its own life and 
support. <p>
Without the middle there is no leisure, there is no rest, there is no sleep. The 
ability to pause before we react is the middle ground. That is what makes up 
stability. Pondering. Mediation. Sleep at night brings rest, recuperation. The 
time to perform maintenance. There is no fall. When I listen I also rest. 
Without the middle there is also no listening, no meditation, no receiving of 
inspiration, no planning, and no thought. Of course there is development during 
these times of rest but first there must be repair. Growth is halted somewhat 
during these times of repair before the extension and strength develop. Is there 
a fall? Yes &#8211; a little. It is the step back. The step back that one must take in 
order to evaluate a healthy direction and BE ABLE TO go forward again. SOMETIMES 
in order to go forward we have to take a step back. Use this fall. And use it 
well. It is how we are designed and what we are designed for. There is no longer 
any need to fear settling. There is no longer any need to trick ourselves into 
growth. That is all that Plato wanted to do for us. Fence sitting has its place. 
We understand it now. We can use it now. We know what it offers us and we know 
how it tempts us. And we can freely leave it now, if we so choose.<ul>
	<li>There is only right and wrong.</li>
	<li>There is only hot and cold.</li>
	<li>There is only love or hate.</li>
	<li>There is only black and white. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
Plato went in a certain direction to improve on what Socrates had stated. There 
is always a better way. There is always a correction. Whatever anybody says 
somebody else will come along and say it better. That is the nature of growth.
<p>
Socrates said there is black, white, and shades of gray. Plato said there is 
only black and white. In continuing in the same direction that Plato started 
there is an interesting choice. He eliminated stability. The next step would be 
to eliminate decay. There is only growth. There is only life. We are eternal (at 
least our soul is). We have immortality. We have eternal life. We are forever. 
Within this context is all that is good and wonderful. It is full of hope, 
delight, wonder, and perfection.<p>
Of course, the Plato&#8217;s state of life could be eliminated and all that is left is 
the state of decay. Some choose this state. It doesn&#8217;t seem to be much fun, 
maybe interesting, but certainly not fun. But it is a choice.<p>
Going in the opposite direction of Plato back to Socrates&#8217; perception of three 
states we can add two more states of existence to the already three states of 
Socrates. To the three states of growth, stability, and decay is added a fourth 
state called an interesting state. Interesting is engaging or exciting and 
holding the attention or curiosity. Another state that we can add is fun. Fun is 
something that provides mirth or amusement &#8211; place of enjoyment or playfulness. 
From these five states there are an infinite combination of sub-states. Rather 
than go into the endless details of wonderful combinations you could simply say 
&#8211; grow, live, be eternal, immortality for all, we are forever. Within this 
context is all that is good and wonderful. It is full of hope, delight, wonder, 
and perfection.<p>
And now the circle is closed. Going in either direction of Socrates or Plato you 
come full circle to appreciate all the different choices and ways of living life 
offers. You can choose any part of the circle you want to live in. You can live 
it however you want. This is the essence of String Theory (the advancement of 
quantum mechanics). It is this simple. Choosing your perspective (or reality) to 
live in life. <p>
Plato could have said there is black, white, shades of gray, color, and many 
other spectrums of light not even visible to the human eye. Whatever you can 
conceive and believe can become a reality. So if you choose to live in a world 
that is do or die &#8211; you get to. If you choose to live in a world of only 
stability and happiness &#8211; you get to. Or you can choose to live in a world of 
growth, stability, death, and everything more we can conceive and receive. All 
you have to do is find the doorway and enter in.<p>
</p>
<p>We can achieve perfection. We all know the difficult realities of actually 
achieving perfection within this lifetime. The difficulties and realistic 
possibilities that to live in achieving perfection seems to be a bit unrealistic 
for us in this life time. And not that we don&#8217;t keep heading towards it! Well, 
there is a way to achieve perfection within this lifetime. A realistic way. An 
achievable way. It is quick and clean. We can achieve it almost immediately. But 
that discussion is for another time; a time in which you will not have to take 
my word for it but only recognize the ring of truth in my words if it is there. 
All that needs to be said now is the direction has been hinted at in this 
paragraph.<p>
Of course you have the right to choose your own beliefs. And I will not refute 
nor discourage that. I will argue what I believe and sometimes even with passion 
but I do not want to be accused of taking your choice away. Literally we know 
from string theory that we can choose our own beliefs to come into reality. But 
that discussion is also for another time. Choose, and choose well for only our 
time is limited. </p>
