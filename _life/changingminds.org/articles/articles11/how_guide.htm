The How-To Sales Guide. How to Learn How to Sell.</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Jon Gilge</i></p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<p>So you have a job in sales.<p>
Now what!<p>
You have to learn how to sell, that&#8217;s what, but how exactly do you go about 
doing that?<p>
Let me share with you how to learn how to sell so you can insure that you will 
be successful in the profession of selling. Essentially, this article will share 
with you exactly how to organize and implement the process of learning how sell 
by starting with the resources and processes that you need to put into place.<p>
Let&#8217;s get started.<p>
&nbsp;<h2>
How-To Sales Guide: Before You Learn How to Sell</h2>
<p>
First things first&#8211;<p>
You start the process of being successful in sales by understanding this:<p>
Sales success has very little to do with natural talent, and everything to do 
with practicing a set of skills known to produce sales success.<p>
Talent is largely a myth as it relates to success. In sports, in business, in 
life, and specifically in sales, it is not the most talented person that has the 
greatest success, but the person who applies the most effort to perfecting the 
skills that lead to success.<p>
This is great news, because it means that effort will make you great, and effort 
is a choice that is completely up to you. If you want to learn how to sell 
successfully there is nothing beyond your control that is needed to do so. The 
greatest salespeople that I know, every one of them, have worked harder than 
their peers on the skills of selling, and it is this characteristic alone that 
has created their success.<p>
So you have no disadvantages, and every advantage if you are willing to choose 
to make the effort.<h2>
<p>
How-To Sales Guide: Who to Learn How to Sell From</h2>
<p>
Every sales organization has top performers, and most of them have poor 
performers. Both of them are your allies.<p>
Learn how to sell by utilizing both effectively.<h3>
The Top Performers</h3>
<p>
You&#8217;ll want to learn how to sell from the best, but the top performers in any 
organization are not always easily willing to share their secrets with the new 
sales representative. This is understandable. In their career they have probably 
seen hundreds of new salespeople come and go, and are justifiably reluctant to 
spend their time with someone who may not be around next year or even next 
month.<p>
You need to convince them that you are worth the effort because you are 
committed to doing whatever it takes to succeed<p>
How to you do this?<p>
It&#8217;s not too hard. You tell them.<p>
&#8220;I am serious about being successful and I want to learn from the best. I 
promise not to waste your time, get in your way, or not put in the time to 
master what you teach me. Give me the time and won&#8217;t regret it.&#8221;<p>
A little flattery, a bit of appeal to the ego that most great salespeople have, 
and you should have yourself a teacher. Great salespeople all had teachers, and 
at some level are looking for someone to pass that knowledge onto. Convince them 
that years from now you will be their legacy in the profession of selling and 
they will gladly teach you how to sell.<p>
Now, follow through on your promises, take excellent notes, practice what they 
teach you, and never forget to thank them for their assistance.<h3>
The Poor Performers</h3>
<p>
Don&#8217;t forget the poor performers. You can also learn how to sell from these 
people by learning what not to do. These salespeople are not where they are for 
lack of talent (you&#8217;ll remember that talent is a myth), but because they have 
not put in the effort to learn the skills that would make them successful. By 
observing what they do you will understand what doesn&#8217;t work, and most often 
reinforce the idea that the difference between this group and the high 
performers is that the former has put in little if any effort into learning how 
to sell correctly.<h2>
<p>
How-To Sales Guide: How to Use Resources to Learn How to Sell</h2>
<p>
Hopefully your company teaches you how to sell, but how do you use that 
education to learn how to sell.<p>
There is a big difference between being taught how to sell, and learning how to 
sell. Anyone can sit in the class, nod their head, ask a few questions and take 
a few notes, and convince themselves that for having done so that they&#8217;ve got 
it.<p>
You haven&#8217;t.<p>
Learning is an active process&#8211; a very active process.<p>
Hearing information will likely result in a retention rate of around 15%. This 
is far from what is needed to actually apply the information to a sales 
situation.<p>
Here&#8217;s how you really learn.<p>
Take great notes. Don&#8217;t repeat the information on the printed materials you were 
given but rather supplement it.<p>
Review the information each night. Each day will present new information that 
builds on what you&#8217;ve learned the day before. There won&#8217;t be much time to go 
back and review if you&#8217;ve fallen behind.<p>
Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse. Since you will be speaking to prospects, practice 
by speaking. Learning is largely context based, meaning that if you practice by 
studying notes you will become proficient at recalling written information&#8211; 
hardly effective in selling. But if you practice by speaking the information you 
will be prepared to deliver the message to your prospects.<p>
Organize a study session. This sounds like you are back in school but it really 
works. The only thing better than practicing the presentation of your sales 
information out loud is doing it in front of people that can offer feedback and 
give you the additional context of presenting to a real person.<h2>
<p>
How-To Sales Guide: Learn How to Sell by Living Sales</h2>
<p>
To complete the process of leaning how to learn to sell, you need to learn to be 
a salesperson. By this I&#8217;m not referring to what you do, but who you are. You 
need to learn to be a salesman by involving yourself deeply in the life of a 
salesperson. Here are some ways to do that:<p>
Read sales books. There is some great information about the profession of 
selling from people who were great salespeople. Learn from them and apply it to 
what you are selling.<p>
Associate with other salespeople. You will rise to the level of your peers more 
often then not, and by associating with successful salespeople you will give 
yourself a pattern to emulate.<p>
Be an active member of the sales community. There are several great online 
resources and forums where professional sales practices are discussed in great 
detail (<a href="http://salesgravy.com">salesgravy.com</a>, 
<a href="http://salespractice.com">salespractice.com</a>, 
<a href="https://changingminds.org">changingminds.org</a>). Join great 
salespeople there to learn how to sell, and teach other where you can.<p>
That&#8217;s it. Not complicated but is does involve some effort like most worthwhile 
things do.<p>
