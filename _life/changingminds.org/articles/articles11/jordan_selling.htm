What Jordan Can Teach You About Selling</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: </i>Jon Gilge, The Sales GIANT</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>On the basketball court Michael Jordan was a winner. While he didn&#8217;t win 
every game nor make every shot, he played each game and took each shot as a 
winner- it was part of who he made himself to be as a competitor. </p>
<p>Was he the best ever? If he wasn&#8217;t then there is a very short list of names 
above him, and a very long list of people below him of comparable talent and 
ability who never made out of those talents what Jordan did. What was it about 
Jordan that made him special? What was it beyond the speed and agility, the 
touch and power, that others have had in equal measure but that never took them 
as high as Michael. For clues to the causes of his greatness we have to look 
beyond the physical prowess to the mental discipline and strength that took a 
physical ability and turned it into a dominate and often unstoppable force in 
the game he played. We have many candidates as to just what particular aspects 
of the mental game were most important to his success; his singular focus on 
winning, his motivation to be the best, his drive to perfect his game, his ego, 
and many others. </p>
<p>From the lessons learned from Jordan&#8217;s mastery of the mental game of winning 
we can find paths to the same level of success in professional selling. The key 
to doing so is in finding parallels with the mental game of winning in sales and 
learning to to apply them with the same intensity that he applied them to the 
game of basketball. </p>
<p>In this article I want to take a look at just one of those aspects, the focus 
on winning, and show you how you can apply it to your sales career so that you 
can be the legend to your profession that he was to his. </p>
<p>As salespeople we encounter wins and losses every day. It is a conditioned 
human tendency to focus on the losses, and through the repetition of doing so we 
can unnecessarily bias our performance toward failure. It all comes down to a 
matter of expectation. The subconscious human mind can&#8217;t tell the difference 
between things that happen and things that are vividly imagined. Each time you 
have a bad experience selling, and each time you recall the experience, you 
create an impression on your subconscious. The sum total of the experiences and 
your recollection of those experiences creates an expectation of another 
negative event. When you expect a negative outcome, most likely you will be 
right because your mind will find a way to fulfill what you have told it to 
expect. </p>
<p>This function of the mind can also work to your benefit. If you reinforce 
positive expectations by focusing on the positive results, you can bias you mind 
toward successful outcomes. As with negative conditioning, the sum total of your 
positive experiences plus your positive recollections of those experiences 
creates an expectation of positive outcomes. As such, the negatives and 
positives are weighed against each other with the scales tilting in the 
direction of your most pervasive thoughts. Since experiences are far less 
frequent than their recollection, the mental game of creating the expectation of 
positive outcomes is far more important than what was actually experienced. </p>
<p>An example: You have two sales calls, the first goes very well and you make a 
small sale that will probably lead to repeat business in the future. The second 
goes very differently. The prospect is difficult, not wanting to give you more 
than a few minutes of his time, pushes you for price, and tells you he doesn&#8217;t 
want to hear how your product is better because they are all the same. You leave 
upset for having wasted your time with this prospect. On the way home you go 
over the second meeting several times in you head, thinking about what you could 
have said to that jerk. At home you tell your wife about it, then replay it 
again in your mind a few times as you watch tv. You go to sleep thinking about 
it, and wake up with it still on your mind. At the office you turn in your sales 
paperwork from the first call, and tell your manager the entire story of the 
second. You then get your appointments for the day and leave the office hoping 
that you are not meeting with another jerk. </p>
<p>If you look back over the example above you will see that the good event made 
one impression on the mind, when it happened, while the bad experience made 10 
impressions, once when it happened and 10 more times through its vivid 
recollection. Your mind is now biased toward failure 10 to 1 and this is just 
from one day. It is imperative to our sales success that we turn the tables on 
this bias, and for a lesson on that we come back to Michael Jordan and his 
singular focus on winning. </p>
<p>Before every game, Michael Jordan had a ritual. You probably have seen the 
images of him before a game, deep in thought with headphones on ears. This is a 
common sight so far, by no means exclusive to Jordan, but there is a difference. 
While most players are listening to music, getting ready to play a game, Jordan 
is getting ready to win. What is playing on his headphones is not music, but 
rather a two hour audio recording of the play by play calls of him winning games 
by taking the last shot. Jordan may have missed more game winning shots than he 
made, but he made them more often than anyone else, and the ones he made he made 
over and over in his mind so that when he walked out onto the floor his mind was 
so biased in favor of a positive outcome that more often that not he won. How 
often do you think Jordan reinforced the ones he missed by going over and over 
them in his mind? I don&#8217;t have an answer from the source, but his results tell 
me that it couldn&#8217;t have been often. </p>
<p>As sales professional, how can we develop a pre-sales call ritual that will 
instill in us that same expectation of success? Following are a few suggestions:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Carry with you copies of the sales contracts from your best and most 
	difficult sales, the ones where you were so good and ended up making a sale 
	you don&#8217;t think anyone else could have made. If you are new to selling, any 
	contract will do because they represent success. Before each sales call take 
	a few minutes to look over the contracts and remember your successes. You 
	can also use them after appointments that didn&#8217;t go well to counteract the 
	tendency to dwell on the negative.</li>
	<li>Before each sales call, take a moment to imagine the successful 
	conclusion of the meeting. Picture you and the customer shaking hands while 
	he thanks you for your skill and professionalism that helped him get a 
	product that will eally help him.</li>
	<li>Refuse to spend time trading stories of negative experiences with your 
	fellow sales representative. Tell only positive stories and when others want 
	to talk of failures politely ask them to tell you about a recent success 
	instead. The power of our expectations is too important to give it over to 
	the control of those negative people we are around every day.</li>
	<li>For sales managers, use a technique that I often employed when managing 
	a sales team: Respond to nonconstructive negative talk by quaking like a 
	duck. Very quickly the office talk will turn positive because no one wants 
	to provoke the duck call which will bring the entire office to a stop to see 
	who is being negative. Your team will pick up on it and start using it as 
	well, helping to reinforce the message with a quack to remind a team member 
	to stop talking failure. </li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, if you focus on successes you will bias yourself toward more 
successes in the future. Positive expectations must be established and 
maintained by constant effort to shield yourself against the slippery slope of 
failure which ruins so many salespeople. </p>
