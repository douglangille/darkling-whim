First Contact: what to do, why, and how to get better results</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
</p>
<p><p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Depending on the selling approach you&#8217;re using, you are closing between .6% &#8211; 
7% , regardless of size of solution or industry. </p>
<p>These numbers are far lower than they need to be: so long as your primary 
focus is on making a sale and you focus on needs assessment and solution choice 
(factors which are the buyer&#8217;s final considerations), and ignore the change 
management issues buyers must handle before they choose a solution, you are 
delaying a close by a factor of 8. </p>
<p>By using a different focus and changing your &#8216;first contact&#8217; criteria, you 
can enter your prospect&#8217;s world and get onto the Buying Decision Team much 
earlier. And close more/quicker. But it requires a new skill to add to your 
sales model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>WHAT ISN&#8217;T WORKING WITH CURRENT APPROACHES </h3>
<p>Here are some numbers my clients have given me over 20+ years: </p>
<p>When using a non-marketing-automation selling model (any form of needs-based 
consultative selling), and your first contact is to make an appointment as your 
first outcome, you close 2% from first call (with no idea who might be a 
prospect, you must start counting your &#8216;close rates&#8217; from this first call &#8211; not 
from your appointment). It might show up as 15% if you track from first 
appointment. </p>
<p>When you go through lead scoring and lead nurturing, and then attempt to make 
an appointment, you are closing much less than 1%. And when counting from first 
appointment, the close rate shows up as 17% &#8212; real, only if the names ignored by 
lead scoring had no probability. </p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, any time you begin your sale with an attempt to get an 
appointment, you are being rejected by approximately 90 &#8211; 97% of perfectly good 
prospects. </p>
<p class="quote"><i>At least 50% of the people you are calling are viable prospects. Easily half 
of these can close. Are you closing at least 25% of all of your raw leads? These 
folks are going to buy something similar to your solution within 2 years &#8211; but 
not from you. If you employ a change management model from the first call rather 
than attempt to get an appointment, you will close more, help put together &#8211; and 
become part of - the Buying Decision Team on your first call, and making you 
invaluable immediately. </i> </p>
<p>Note: until or unless the entire Buying Decision Team is on board, buyers 
will not have the full fact pattern to understand what a solution must include, 
regardless of what their need or &#8216;pain&#8217; looks like to us. And generally, buyers 
do not know all of the Team members until they are close to the end, thereby 
delaying a purchase. </p>
<p class="quote"><i>When you Qualify a lead via marketing automation, and use some sort of 
subjective lead scoring, you are omitting perfectly good leads that fall out of 
the marketing automation or lead scoring process. You are losing many of the 
leads that will eventually purchase your solution (probably from someone else) 
within the next two years.</i><p>
If you first connect using a qualification process that includes change 
management criteria, you can turn around a lead from &#8216;potential interest&#8217; to 
&#8216;qualified prospect&#8217; within 10 minutes, and reduce the sales cycle by 50% 
regardless of the size of the solution. <p>
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
HAVING A NEED DOES NOT MAKE SOMEONE A BUYER </h3>
<p>When you attempt to Qualify using need, purchasing capability, or timing, or 
use a Trusted Advisor approach, you are omitting all of those pe0ple who </p>
<ol>
	<li>don&#8217;t know know exactly what they need yet and are not quite ready for 
solution data, </li>
	<li>have not managed the off-line change and are not ready to buy &#8211; but are indeed 
buyers and know they have a need, </li>
	<li>are doing their due diligence, but have assigned others to do on-line research 
for them and don&#8217;t seem to be relevant leads, </li>
	<li>have not the full solution criteria because they are still getting their Buying 
Decision Team members on board. </li>
	</ol>
	<p>
Once you Qualify using a change management focus &#8211; how will they go about 
becoming excellent, address what has stopped them until now, what will they need 
to do to ready themselves for some sort of change, how they can meld a new 
solution with the old workaround - you can actually create buyers very quickly. 
Remember that until or unless buyers are able to avoid disrupting their status 
quo, they will not buy. And the sales model is not capable of helping them walk 
through this, leaving them to show up as Not Qualified.<p>
</p>
<p>The last thing buyers need is solution information, and they need very little 
of this on the first contact. Until or unless they get feedback on all who touch 
the solution, and then know how to move forward with change and solution 
adoption in a way that will create few ripples in their system, prospects cannot 
buy &#8211; separate from their need. </p>
<p>Personally, you may not care about the private, back-end buying journey. But 
by collapsing the buyer&#8217;s journey between first thought and purchase, by helping 
them get ALL Buying Decision Team members on board early to define the solution 
and change processes, and get the right policies in place quickly, you can find 
more prospects, close a lot more sales (400-800% higher close rate over sales 
alone) and waste a lot less time &#8211; not to mention forecast more efficiently.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>THE BUYING FACILITATION METHOD? CHANGES THE NUMBERS </h3>
<p>With a cold call and a good list, using the Buying Facilitation Method?, my 
clients close 35% from first call &#8211; often without an appointment, and always at 
least 50% quicker. </p>
<p>Buying Facilitation&#8482; facilitates the behind-the-scenes change management 
issues necessary prior to a purchase, puts you onto the Buying Decision Team 
immediately (first call) , and teaches the buyer how to recognize and manage 
their internal systems issues up front. The model works in any situation in 
which back-end decisions get made: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Periodic upsell for new solutions </li>
		<li>Client recovery to re-engage with lapsed customer relationships </li>
		<li>Prospecting, telepromoting/telemarketing, and follow up from marketing 
automation </li>
		<li>Managing negotiations </li>
		<li>Pipeline reviews/management </li>
		<li>Qualifying &#8211; for proposal management, sales, marketing, pre-lead scoring 
		</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
I can&#8217;t teach you Buying Facilitation&#8482; in a blog. But here are two questions to 
start your calls with:<p class="quote">
<i>How are you currently adding new capability to your X? </i> <p class="quote">
<i>At what point would you and your decision team be seeking to add something new 
to what you&#8217;re already doing successfully?</i><p>
Let&#8217;s add Buying Facilitation&#8482; to every sales process &#8211; as a front end to 
marketing automation, or a new skill for sales folks - and close in half the 
time, manage our pipeline in a timely way, find the right buyers immediately and 
get rid of the time wasters immediately. And start the process from the very 
first contact. </p>
