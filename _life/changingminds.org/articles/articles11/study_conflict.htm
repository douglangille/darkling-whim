Why I Study Seemingly Impossible Conflicts</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Peter T. Coleman </i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our ability to address seemingly intractable conflicts may very well 
determine our capacity to survive as a species. Intractable conflicts are 
defined as disputes that are highly destructive, enduring, and particularly 
resistant to attempts to resolve them. Currently, about 40% of intrastate armed 
conflicts have persisted for 10 years or more, with 25% of the wars being waged 
lasting for more than 25 years. Although we are seeing more peace negotiations 
than military victories these days, 25% of them relapse into violence within 5 
years. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I became interested in studying enduring conflicts initially through my 
experiences working as a counselor with violent urban youth in psychiatric 
hospitals, and then through my work as a community mediator for the New York 
State Criminal Courts and as an instructor in a course on preventative diplomacy 
at the United Nations. As a doctoral student, I first began to conduct research 
in this area focusing on &quot;ripeness&quot; (a readiness to negotiate). This often 
entails a radical shift in intentions, attitudes, and behaviors (from 
destructive to constructive), and is extremely difficult to achieve due to long 
histories of animosity, suspicion, fear, and atrocities committed by many of the 
parties involved. The literature suggested that in prolonged conflicts, ripeness 
typically occurs as a result of the intense pain, suffering, and sense of dread 
that accompanies a violent stalemate between the conflicting parties. However in 
many intractable conflicts (particularly conflicts over &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;justice&quot;), 
such suffering has the paradoxical effect of further entrenching the parties in 
the conflict. <br>
<br>
</p>
<p>In response to this paradox, I began work on a more comprehensive model for 
conceptualizing the shift toward constructive interactions in intractable 
conflicts; initially developing a theoretical model that offered alternative 
avenues to fostering ripeness through the application of basic Lewinian 
principles of motivation and change. This model stressed the importance of 
addressing obstacles or constraints to peaceful encounters, such as a lack of 
trust, interpersonal contact, and safe channels for communication. Removing such 
constraints can increase ripeness without the rise in intensity of conflict 
associated with increases in pain and suffering. <br>
<br>
</p>
<p>However, as my understanding of various intractable conflicts deepened (such 
as those regarding abortion or race relations in communities and the conflicts 
in Cyprus and the Middle East), so did my awareness of their complex and dynamic 
natures. In other words, I began to recognize that studying conflict at a single 
point in time, or focusing on a single aspect (e.g. obstacles), was ultimately 
problematic because it failed to capture the fact that conflict, particularly 
intractable conflict, is multifaceted; involving multiple experiences and 
encounters between many different parties over a variety of issues under diverse 
conditions which change in time. <br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Thus, I embarked on a new approach to this work. It built on four basic 
premises regarding contemporary conflict: 1) our world is becoming increasingly 
more complex, ecologically, politically, economically, and socially, 2) human 
systems are ever-changing and the pace of change is rising, 3) such complexity 
and dynamism place extraordinary demands on our capacities to accurately 
comprehend enduring conflicts, and 4) this often leads to oversimplification of 
problems and an over-reliance on our primary frames of understanding, which are 
useful but limited. For instance, if we reflect on many of the ethnopolitical 
conflicts in the post Cold War world, we see a complex pattern of interlacing 
schisms emerging&#8211; based on ethnicity, religion, economic well-being, population 
density, environmental degradation, collapsed states, globalized markets, and 
geopolitical shifts. Equally intricate patterns of discord can be found in many 
of the protracted conflicts in our institutional, group, and personal lives. 
Despite these trends, much of the research on intractability is either 
fine-grained and piecemeal (focusing on independent cause and effect 
relationships), or case studies of specific situations viewed through a 
particular disciplinary lens. Similarly, our interventions, often informed by 
such research, have limited or even unintended negative effects. <br>
<br>
</p>
<p>With funding from the James S. McDonnell Foundation and the Community 
Foundation of Boulder, I began to convene a multidisciplinary team of experts 
which developed a new theoretical model that connects prior research on 
psychosocial coherence and complexity with basic differences in the underlying 
dynamics of intractable versus more manageable social conflict (Coleman, 
Vallacher, Nowak, &amp; Bui-Wrzosinska, 2007; Nowak, Vallacher, Bui-Wrzosinska, &amp; 
Coleman, 2006; Vallacher, Coleman, Nowak, &amp; Bui-Wrzosinska, 2010b; Vallacher, 
Coleman, Nowak, &amp; Bui-Wrzosinska, 2010a). The model employs concepts and methods 
from dynamical social psychology- in particular the idea of attractors (patterns 
in data that resist change) - and portrays intractable conflicts as those which 
have lost the complexity and openness inherent to more constructive social 
dynamics.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><hr>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>To date this project has resulted in over 40 publications and 45 conference 
presentations by our team, publication of a new trade book (The Five Percent), a 
proposal of a new scholarly book (The Gravity of Conflict), a special issue of 
Peace and Conflict: The Journal of Peace Psychology showcasing dynamical-systems 
theory applications to conflict research, development and publication of an 
on-line computer visualization tool for working with intractability (Nowak, Bui-Wrzosinska, 
Coleman, Vallacher, Borkovsky &amp; Jochemczyk, 2010) and, with TC's Ed Lab, the 
creation of several short introductory videos on intractable attractors (<a href="http://fivepercentbook.com">http://fivepercentbook.com</a>). 
We are also currently developing an executive education module in this area, 
which will be completed in Spring, 2012.<br>

			<td>ONE IN EVERY TWENTY DIFFICULT CONFLICTS ends up not in a calm 
			reconciliation or tolerable standoff but as an acute lasting 
			antagonism. Such conflicts -- the five percent -- can be found among 
			the diplomatic and political clashes we read about every day in the 
			newspaper but also, and in a no less damaging and dangerous form, in 
			our private and personal lives, within families, in work-places, and 
			among neighbors. These self-perpetuating conflicts resist mediation, 
			defy conventional wisdom, and drag on and on, worsening over time. 
			Once we get pulled in, it is nearly impossible to escape. The five 
			percent rules us.
			<p>So what can we do when we find ourselves ensnared? According to 
			Dr. Peter T. Coleman, to contend with this destructive species of 
			conflict we must understand the invisible dynamics at work. Coleman 
			has extensively researched the essence of conflict in his 
			&quot;Intractable Conflict Lab,&quot; the first research facility devoted to 
			the study of polarizing conversations and seemingly unresolveable 
			disagreements. Informed by lessons drawn from practical expereince, 
			advances in complexity theory, and the psychological and social 
			currents that drive conflicts both international and domestic, 
			Coleman offers innovative new strategies for dealing with disputes 
			of all types, ranging from abortion debates to the enmity between 
			Israelis and Palestinians. </p>
			<p>A timely, paradigm-shifting look at conflict, The Five Percent is 
			an invaluable guide to preventing even the most fractious 
			negotiations from foundering. </td>
