The cheapest cure for feeble Mindedness: a dose of Madness</p>

<h2>
Losing your marbles?</h2>
<p>
Ever feel like your losing your marbles? Things can be fine one day and then all 
of a sudden you find yourself feeling unable to cope with what the universe 
throws at you. The little frustrations that have been slowly niggling away in 
the back of your mind are thrown forward by the smallest of triggers and you 
suddenly feel helpless and full of unwanted negativity.<p>
Maybe you&#8217;re broke and sick of seeing others swinging mounds of shopping bags 
over their shoulders, staggering forward in their laboutins. You feel so enraged 
that you want to trip them over, spilling their bags so that they can feel an 
ounce of the humiliation you feel when you get on the bus and realize you can't 
afford the fare... Off to work by foot in your holey Primark numbers. Again.<p>
He's just left you, you want him back, and he doesn't care. You see him looking 
happy with another; you want to cause serious damage and destruction. How are 
you going to exercise the control required to keep you out of the nut house or 
worse... Jail? Other happy couples make you feel so inadequate that leaving the 
house just doesn't seem like an option.<p>
You are being constantly disappointed by others. Parents, friends, work 
colleagues... All they do is let you down, just when you really need it. Ugh! 
You know that you have been a reliable shoulder to cry on, so why can't you 
expect the same in return? <h2>
Can somebody help me? It's me Miss A...</h2>
<p>
You have no specific ailment. You are not grieving. You are not suffering from a 
recognized mental illness. You just feel crap and sad and want to feel better. 
It has been established that you are feeling low and those around you are 
completely useless, so where do you turn?<p>
<b>Therapy?</b> You manage to pull yourself out of bed to go and see your local GP. 
First off doc needs to establish if you are depressed and manic enough to have 
the right to help. But even then, if you do pass the test and are lucky enough 
to get a place on the NHS waiting list. By the time you get to see anyone you 
may well have grown a beard and fingernails so long that you have wrapped 
yourself in a self-made cocoon, which they will cut you out of on the way to the 
white room. <p>
<b>Drugs? </b>We all know that these don't work. Masking the pain, just covers up the 
root. Walking on a cloud of haze may make you feel slightly better. However, you 
are still alert enough to recognize the patronizing looks of others as they gaze 
into your glazed eyes. Take to many and either your organs could fail or you may 
find yourself taking a walk off a very high building...<h2>
Question: What is the cure Answer: A dose of madness!</h2>
<p>
The best cure that I know for the above is a dose of madness. This is the 
cheapest, least invasive type of remedy for a case of the blues.<p>
So, how do you cure yourself with madness? Here are some of my best, personally 
approved special remedies:<p>
<b>Music</b>: The sound of music can be a huge helping hand. Music comes pretty much 
for free and covers a wide spectrum of heartache and emotions. Finding the right 
song is easy. If you think about it right now, there are probably at least a 
couple of songs which come to mind that are an exact match to how you are 
feeling right now. Listen to the song (only once) you don't need to dwell on it. 
You just want to think that how you are feeling right now is not exclusive to 
you and others have been through it and moved on. The next step, is finding 
where you want to be next, how you want to be feeling. Pick a list of upbeat 
songs that scream positivity and optimism and sing and dance in time. Throwing 
yourself around to these fantastic lyrics will give you huge amounts of 
adrenalin and will serve as a motivator if you start to feel yourself sinking.<p>
<b>Screaming</b>: Do you ever feel a huge surge of rage and all you want to do is 
scream? The only thing stopping you is yourself. Forget about feeling silly or 
mad. Screaming is a fabulous therapeutic act and should be made the most of. 
Screaming is free and is available at almost any given time. (Note: even though 
it is a useful tool, you must think before you scream, you don't want to alert 
the neighbors or terrify people. Choose a suitable screaming place at a 
convenient hour)<p>
<b>Write it down and rip it up</b>: Get a piece of paper and a pen and write down what 
is making you feel mad. Put down anything you can think of, no matter how 
trivial. After all it is only you who will see this list so you can be as honest 
and ridiculous as you feel. Here is an example:<p>
I am angry because:<ul>
	<li>He doesn't want me, but he wants her.</li>
	<li>She is ugly and stupid and I love him.</li>
	<li>I told him I loved him and he dumped me, and now he loves her.</li>
	<li>I hate my legs. </li>
	<li>I don't want to feel sad it makes me so mad.</li>
	<li>I hate the stupid bartender that never recognizes me but always says hi to my 
friends.</li>
	<li>I see her 3 times a week and always drink half a lager but she looks straight 
through me.</li>
	<li>He said we were on a break and now he is with her.</li>
	<li>I feel so ugly, I hate my legs</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
Now you have the list, it is time to read it aloud. Read it out over and over 
until your voice has reached a high enough pitch of anger and madness. And when 
you feel that you have reached a rage climax... RIP IT UP! While you rip it up 
scream, shout and move. Jump around and shout that you are not going to feel 
like this anymore, you don't care, forget all of you, and just do whatever feels 
right. And once you have finished chuck it all away and breathe. </p>
<p>Dance! Scream! Rip it up! </p>
<h2>Feeling Better?</h2>
<p>Following this advice, you will hopefully be more optimistic and feel less 
weight on your shoulders. Moving, dancing, screaming, and shouting, writing down 
your words and listening to the words of others are all great ways of releasing 
energy and having a good old laugh at the state you have put yourself in. <p>
Wishing you luck, love and laughter... Miss A The cheapest cure for feeble Mindedness: a dose of Madness<p>
