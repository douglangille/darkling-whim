Effects-Based Thinking: Part II</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: James D. Murphy</i></p>
<p><br>
In 'Effects-Based Thinking - Part I', the definition of effects-based thinking, 
or EBT, was established as an approach to strategic planning which contributes 
to long-lasting organizational impacts. Expanding on this concept, let's look at 
what the differences between strategic planning with EBT and simply tracking 
progress with metrics are. </p>
<p>Many organizations utilize scoreboards or dashboards to track progress toward 
goals. Such methods have values that can be measured in a continuous manner to 
track performance. But such tools are just that - measures of performance toward 
discreet objectives, but not necessarily a component of effects-based thinking. 
These objectives do not always have a clear connection to the organization's 
overarching goals or vision that one gets with EBT. For example, making a 
certain amount of revenue or delivering a particular earnings per share by the 
end of the year are great measurements. How are we going to know whether the 
actions we are taking today and tomorrow are having the right effects upon those 
measurements? How can we utilize effects-based thinking to know that we aren't 
just getting lucky? Furthermore, how do we even know that those measurements are 
the right measurements? And how do we know that the sum of the individual 
actions taken to affect these measurements, which often form the basis of 
incentive systems, are not interfering with each other or ultimately damaging 
the organization? This is where effects-based thinking or EBT comes into play.
</p>
<p>Every organization is a complex system that is typically composed of smaller 
complex systems that are interdependent. Interdependencies between complex 
systems are unpredictable and can create unintended effects or consequences. So, 
the lesson to learn is that scoreboards and dashboards alone are not necessarily 
good indicators of progress toward achieving organizational goals. </p>
<p>So, how do we manage organizations in uncertainty? We do it by first 
developing an understanding of effects-based thinking (EBT) throughout an 
organization. Do the people at the lowest levels of the organization have an 
understanding of the organization's overarching goals in order to make the right 
decisions? Do they have the freedom to exercise judgment? Do they have access to 
the information they need to make those judgments? What about the middle 
managers - do they have the necessary understanding of goals and freedom of 
action to use effects-based thinking in the organization's best interest? 
Furthermore, whether they make the right or the wrong decision, are they 
learning from it and transferring that learning horizontally and vertically 
throughout your organization with EBT? Lastly, are the organization's senior 
leaders learning from what the junior leaders are learning in order to adjust 
the organization's course and strategic direction? To do all these things and 
remain agile in order to adapt to the precarious changes in complex environments 
requires effects-based thinking. </p>
<p>Everything exists within a system and every component of the system has the 
ability to affect everything else, as these components are interdependent. 
Central to EBT is this notion that effects transmit through systems in three 
orders: kinetic, second order, and third order. </p>
<h2>Impacts and Kinetic Effects in EBT </h2>
<p>Think about actions in EBT as &quot;impacts.&quot; Impacts are the actions taken or an 
event that has occurred that causes the rippling effects that cascade throughout 
the larger system. These impacts are &quot;kinetic&quot; effects. Kinetic effects in 
effects-based thinking are measureable and immediate. Typically, then, kinetic 
effects are localized. The effect remains within or close to the originating 
system or transmits merely to the neighboring systems. Kinetic effects have a 
tendency to be a small step toward some larger objective. </p>
<h2>Second Order Effects in EBT </h2>
<p>Second order effects connect the very actionable, controllable, and 
immediately measurable kinetic effects to the long-term organizational goals 
that affect the much larger market or global system. Within effects-based 
thinking, second order effects are those that have a significant impact on the 
primary systems that comprise the overall system. That is, they correspond to an 
organization's individual strategic objectives. Because second order effects 
have a much longer range than kinetic effects in EBT, they typically only 
manifest themselves over a period of months or even years, and present a 
challenge to measurement. </p>
<p>At the level of second order effects, complexity sets in and it isn't always 
clear what might be affecting the success or failure of strategic objectives. 
Measurements may or may not be relevant to those objectives so paramount in 
effects-based thinking. So, the effects that we want at the second order of EBT 
must first be described as desired effects in a simple, clear manner before we 
attach measurements to them. We must also always hold the desired effect as 
primary over the measurements and continually ask ourselves whether the 
measurements are indeed a reflection of progress toward the desired effect. If 
we can't make that connection, then what is the compelling reason to keep doing 
what we are doing? Are our actions in effects-based thinking achieving our 
desired effect? </p>
<p>So, EBT's second order effects are the culmination of a few or many kinetic 
effects. They most likely align with an organization's strategic goals. 
Therefore, scoreboards and dashboards of a few carefully selected metrics can be 
excellent tools for assessing success. But there is another, higher order of 
effects that can't be ignored - third order effects. </p>
<h2>Third Order Effects in EBT </h2>
<p>In EBT, third order effects describe an organization's future picture. A 
future picture is similar to the popular notion of a company's vision. But 
specific to effects-based thinking, a future picture is a high-resolution 
description of some future state of the organization. It is the set of 
long-range goals that the strategy seeks to attain. When we speak of 'ripple 
effects' we are often thinking in terms of third order effects. The set of 
effects, expected and unexpected, that ultimately arise as a function of 
activity over a long period of time - on the order of several years - is the 
domain of third order effects. The future picture is the set of effects we want 
to bring into existence with EBT. Other third order effects, whether created by 
entities outside the organization or by the unforeseeable consequences of 
actions taken within the organization, are what we must guard against. </p>
<p>These three levels of effects in effects-based thinking - kinetic, second 
order, and third order - provide a structure for thinking in terms of planning, 
executing, and assessing an organization's activity within complex environments. 
Effects-based thinking helps guide organizations through such complexity and 
adapt to its constant changes and challenges with greater caution. But, perhaps 
even more importantly, EBT provides everyone in that organization with a simple 
structure to guide and align their actions towards long-range success. </p>
<p>When we bear in mind our ultimate goals when planning and executing toward 
immediate or short-range results, we utilize effects-based thinking to align our 
actions more effectively toward those ultimate goals. With EBT, we're also able 
to better construct, align, and adapt our measurements to ensure we aren't 
measuring the wrong things or, worse, driving the wrong behaviors. </p>
