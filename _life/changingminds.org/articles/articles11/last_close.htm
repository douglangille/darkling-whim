The Last, Last, Last Chance To Close The Sale</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: </i>Jon Gilge</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>How do you close the sale when the prospect won&#8217;t tell you why they won&#8217;t 
buy? </p>
<p>Perhaps you have been in this situation before. </p>
<p>Perhaps you&#8217;ve been in it hundreds of times. Most of us have. Now let&#8217;s take 
a look at how to get out of it and back on track to close the sale. </p>
<p>Unless the customer responds to the buying question with an immediate yes, 
the reality is that if you can&#8217;t get to the reason they aren&#8217;t buying, you can&#8217;t 
close the sale. Where the prospect doesn&#8217;t say yes, if there is not an expressed 
reason for not going ahead with the purchase what is there to resolve in order 
to move the process forward toward the close of the sale? </p>
<p>Nothing. It&#8217;s like climbing a ladder only to discover half way up that there 
are no more rungs. It&#8217;s frustrating because everything indicates that they want 
to buy, and nothing they say helps you understand why they won&#8217;t. </p>
<p>While we know that the reason is most often related to money, suggesting that 
is about the money is the quickest way to insure that the prospect insists that 
it isn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s a natural part of a prospects resistance to buying despite it 
being in their best interest to do so. </p>
<p>A professional salesperson knows how to help a prospect through this 
hesitance and close the sale. Here&#8217;s how. </p>
<p>First we need to understand that prospects often don&#8217;t know when it is really 
about the money for them, and that sometimes it really isn&#8217;t. Either they have 
not been able to clarify in their mind that they really want to buy and money is 
the only obstacle, or they have clarified that the decision is about the money 
but they don&#8217;t want to tell you that. </p>
<p>We need to give them an easy way to realize that it is about the money, and 
if that doesn&#8217;t work, create a way to get them to come back to you when it is.
</p>
<p>Start by taking the pressure off. By now you probably have made numerous 
attempts to uncover an objection so you could close the sale, with each 
subsequent attempt bringing the prospect closer to the point where they will end 
the conversation. The prospect has told you that they like everything, but they 
just need to look around and do some research. Break the pressure by starting to 
pack up your materials. This signals to the prospect that you are finished 
trying to discover why they won&#8217;t buy, and allows them to lower their defenses. 
As you do, say something like this: </p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Prospect, I appreciate the time you spent with me today exploring if my 
product is right for you. I think at this point I have a good understanding of 
where you are in your decision making process. You like the product, the 
company, and the terms that we can offer you, but you just need to be sure that 
you don&#8217;t like another product just a much. Am I correct?&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Great. I&#8217;m sure that over the next several days you are going to give this 
decision some very careful consideration.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;I will.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;At some point, Mr. Prospect, this decision will come down to money. After 
you look around and do your research, you will come to a conclusion about what 
our product is worth to you. When you get to that point, I just ask you to do 
yourself and me one favor in exchange for the time and effort I have put into 
showing you how our product can help you. When it comes down to price, I just 
ask that you give me a call before you come to your decision, to give me one 
last chance to work with my company to meet your expectations on price. Can I 
get your commitment on that?&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;I can do that.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I would do that for you right now, but it&#8217;s not about the money 
yet.&#8221; </p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s take a look at what you&#8217;ve accomplished and what you hope happens 
next. </p>
<p>At the very least, you&#8217;ve decreased the likelihood that the prospect will 
make a decision to buy from someone else without first giving you a call to see 
if you can increase your value by lowering price or offering better terms. As 
you probably already know, it is usually the last sales person to be in front of 
the prospect that gets to close the sale. By interrupting the decision to buy 
from someone else who&#8217;s value may seem to be higher you can get to the prospect 
last with an opportunity to best the other offers. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s what you have accomplished. Now lets look at what you hope will happen 
in those situations where it really is about the price, but the prospect just 
hasn&#8217;t clarified the decision that far. Your last statement is designed to use 
curiosity to bring the discussion back around to price and get you back on a 
track that can lead you to a sale. </p>
<p>&#8220;Well what is it that you could do on price?&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done all I can. You have my best price. But what my company might be 
willing to do beyond that would depend on what you need us to do. If you will 
share with me what you value the product at I will see what I can do to meet 
your expectation.&#8221; </p>
<p>With their response you are back into the sales conversation. What they have 
essentially done it resolved the decision to price. From there you can make the 
phone call to get approval to meet their price. Either you can or you can&#8217;t, or 
you can counteroffer. By naming a price they are starting a negotiation and 
would probably agree to buy at a price somewhere in the middle of your offer and 
theirs. </p>
<p>Remember, before you call for an approval on their offer, get a commitment:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Before I make the call, I need your commitment that if my company is willing 
to meet your valuation of the product you are willing to go ahead with the order 
today.&#8221; </p>
<p>Then make the call, negotiate the final price, and close the sale.<br>
