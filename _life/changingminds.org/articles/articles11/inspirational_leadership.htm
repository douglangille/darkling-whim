The Secrets Of Inspirational Leadership</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Jonathan Farrington</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An inspired and motivated workforce is essential for any business that hopes 
to stay ahead of the competition. But just how do you motivate people? What kind 
of leadership do people respond to? And how can you improve the quality of 
leadership in your business? </p>
<h2>The Inspiration Gap </h2>
<p>In a survey of more than one and a half thousand managers, people were asked 
what they would most like to see in their leaders. The most popular answer, 
mentioned by 55% of people, was &#8216;inspiration&#8217;. </p>
<p>When asked if they would describe their current leader as &#8216;inspiring&#8217;, only 
11% said &#8216;yes&#8217;. The two attributes that people actually mentioned most often, 
when describing their leaders, were &#8216;knowledgeable&#8217; and &#8216;ambitious&#8217;. As well as 
this thirst for inspiring leadership, there&#8217;s also evidence to support the idea 
that companies with inspiring leaders perform better. </p>
<p>The Sunday Times publishes an annual survey of the &#8216;Best Companies to Work 
For&#8217;, which is compiled from the opinions of the companies&#8217; own employees. One 
interesting fact is that those &#8216;Best Companies&#8217;, that are publicly quoted 
consistently, outperform the FTSE All-Share Index. Five-year compound returns 
show a 5.7% negative return for FTSE All-Share companies against a 13.6% gain 
for the &#8216;Best Companies&#8217;. Over three years, the returns were -11.3% and 6.7% 
respectively while, in the last twelve months, they were 23.1% and 44%. </p>
<p>The &#8216;Best Companies to Work For&#8217; have also performed impressively on staff 
turnover, sickness rates, absenteeism, and the ability to recruit good quality 
people. </p>
<p>The stereotype of the inspirational leader as someone extrovert and 
charismatic is the exception, rather than the rule. Looking at best practice 
across business, though some inspirational leaders certainly do fit this mould, 
a large number do not. Many are quiet, almost introverted. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following are 
some of the most commonly observed characteristics of inspiring leaders: </p>
<h2>Strong Strategic Focus </h2>
<p>They are very good at ensuring that the business only does those things where 
it has the resources to do a good job and where it can add real value. </p>
<h2>Lateral Thinkers </h2>
<p>They are particularly adept at drawing on experiences, outside their own 
sectors, and taking a much broader view than the norm. They look at things very 
laterally and encourage their people to do the same. </p>
<h2>Vision and Communication </h2>
<p>An inspirational leader has a very strong, customer-focused vision of where 
the business should be going. Importantly, they are also able to communicate 
their vision so that their people feel they own it and know where they fit into 
it. The best leaders are great communicators who prefer plain speaking to 
jargon. </p>
<h2>Principled </h2>
<p>They are deeply committed, courageous, demanding of themselves and their 
people and confident - albeit often in a quiet and under-stated way. What 
singles them out is an exceptionally strong set of values built on honesty, 
openness and true respect for their people. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What makes an inspiring leader? </p>
<h2>Reflective </h2>
<p>What distinguishes them is genuine humility and not being afraid to show 
vulnerability on occasions. This comes from regular periods of reflection and an 
unquenchable thirst for learning. </p>
<h2>Risk Takers </h2>
<p>They have a marked tendency to &#8216;bend the rules&#8217;, take calculated risks and, 
on occasions, be guided by their gut-feelings. They also tolerate this in other 
people, recognizing that a certain amount of flexibility is essential to adapt 
to circumstances and make real strides forward. </p>
<h2>Accessible </h2>
<p>They make time to get out and speak to people. This informal and personal 
contact is a very powerful motivator. Equally, when they are at their own desk, 
they aren&#8217;t cosseted behind a wall of PAs. </p>
<h2>Value Attitude </h2>
<p>They value skills and training very highly, but they also focus heavily on 
attitude, believing that, without the right attitude and motivation, nothing 
will be achieved. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier, we looked at the qualities of inspiring leaders. The question is, 
why do these traits produce results? </p>
<p>Pay is only one component of job satisfaction. Other factors, like respect 
and prestige, can be tremendously important in making staff feel good about 
their jobs. The reason that inspiring leadership produces results is that it 
contributes directly to fulfilling many of people&#8217;s emotional needs. </p>
<p>The following are some of the ways that best practice in leadership 
contributes to improved job satisfaction, motivation and productivity. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why people respond to leaders </p>
<h2>Being Listened To: </h2>
<p>A business, where only senior managers are allowed to &#8216;have ideas&#8217;, rarely 
achieves great staff satisfaction. Inspirational leaders ask for, and respect, 
what their people tell them about how to do things better - and they provide the 
resources to ensure that the solutions are delivered. </p>
<h2>Being Involved: </h2>
<p>Inspirational leaders involve their people in changes for them to be a 
success. They give their people the freedom and support to get on with the job. 
When you walk around these companies, there is electricity in the air &#8211; you can 
feel the energy and buzz. </p>
<h2>Having Fun: </h2>
<p>In successful companies, people work hard but enjoy themselves in the 
process. Fun is a great indicator that an organisation is innovative and is also 
a key innovation driver. At the &#8216;100 Best Companies to Work For&#8217; you see a lot 
of fun at work. </p>
<h2>Being Trusted: </h2>
<p>It&#8217;s no coincidence that, when you ask people what it is like to work in an 
organisation run by an inspirational leader, they talk about openness, honesty, 
respect and trust. These firms can boast highly committed staff that has a great 
sense of responsibility to their work. </p>
<h2>Being Appreciated: </h2>
<p>Recognition is an absolutely crucial element of inspiration, and few things 
are more powerful, or simple, than a genuine &#8216;thank you&#8217;. Inspirational leaders 
know that it&#8217;s vital that people feel appreciated and valued, so they show their 
appreciation through extensive celebration of success &#8211; both formally and 
informally. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Summary </h2>
<p>The best leaders promote a culture where their people value themselves, each 
other, the company and the customers. Everyone understands how their work makes 
a difference. This helps to build a commitment to higher standards where 
everybody is always looking to do things better.</p>
