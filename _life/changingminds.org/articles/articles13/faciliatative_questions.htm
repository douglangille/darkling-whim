Facilitative Questions: Questions That Facilitate Change With Integrity</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As professionals a big part of our jobs is to influence change. We assume we 
know the appropriate means to get where we want to be. Certainly we think we 
know the right questions to get the data we think we need. </p>
<p>But sometimes we miss the unconscious drivers, and the incomplete data we 
collect as a result skews our outcomes. Or we unwittingly cause resistance even 
when our solutions are important and well-conceived. </p>
<h2>WHAT ARE QUESTIONS AND WHAT DO THEY DO? </h2>
<p>I&#8217;m aware that there is a lot of hype recently about &#8216;asking the right 
questions&#8217;. But the questions we use aren&#8217;t achieving what we want them to 
achieve. Here&#8217;s why: </p>
<ol>
	<li>Questions generally extract information, usually for the benefit of the 
questioner or to enhance the questioner&#8217;s outcome. </li>
	<li>Conventional, or information-based, questions are biased: biased by the 
questioner who seeks a response; biased by the responder who either has a ready 
answer, makes up an answer, declines to answer, or some combination of all. 
	</li>
	<li>The question itself potentially restricts the responder&#8217;s thinking and 
eliminates viable responses, often overlooking important issues. </li>
</ol>
<p>
Information-based questions are the standard, but they unnecessarily bias 
outcomes, activities, and data accuracy. What if it were possible to formulate a 
question that would: </p>
<ul>
	<li>influence change, </li>
	<li>promote efficient implementations, buy-in, and sales cycles, </li>
	<li>avoid resistance and bias, </li>
	<li>maintain personal integrity, </li>
	<li>avoid the problems we face when unconscious issues rear their ugly heads? 
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
Questions can be a vehicle for true leadership, change and discovery. But not 
the ones we are accustomed to. </p>
<h2>INFLUENCING CHOICE </h2>
<p>Since I&#8217;ve been a teenager I&#8217;ve studied the brain for ways to impact our own 
unconscious choices, difficult to influence because of the elusive nature of the 
unconscious. I was particularly curious if it were possible for an outsider to 
help us make good decisions that would maintain our integrity by helping uncover 
and reweight our unconscious criteria. </p>
<p>In 1988 I read Roger Schank&#8217;s The Creative Attitude. The book discusses how 
the unconscious biases all decisions. I was most interested in his ideas about 
how our brains store data in memory indices. The idea that inspired me to action 
remains with me: the only way to get to these hidden bits of memory is through 
questions. Hhmmm. I found that interesting. Was it possible to use questions to 
unlock everything in the indices &#8211; including the unconscious drivers, the 
beliefs, the values, the emotions? How could they be used without causing 
resistance, given the biased nature of questions? </p>
<p>I began experimenting with new forms of questions that would uncover 
unconscious drivers and make it possible to consider change from the inside out. 
I finally came up with a model that enables an outsider to facilitate 
unconscious choices. </p>
<p>[I&#8217;m going to walk you through an overview of how I came up with the solution 
I&#8217;ve been teaching in corporations for 25 years. It&#8217;s a bit different than 
you&#8217;re used to, so hang with me. And I&#8217;m always available to discuss it. At the 
end of the article I&#8217;ve linked to ways you can learn more. For this article, I&#8217;m 
introducing the concepts.] </p>
<p>I recognized two main factors that offer the foundation to thinking of 
questions and decision making differently: information and systems. </p>
<p><b>Information</b>: Our current skills usually employ information as the arbiter of 
change: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Sellers gather and pitch information; </li>
	<li>coaches, consultants, facilitators and leaders use &#8216;rational&#8217; ideas 
(information) as the bedrock of requesting change; </li>
	<li>decision analysts gather, weight, and analyze information to compare choices.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
But information-gathering avoids engaging core beliefs; without addressing the 
gooey, human stuff that is such a vital part of the status quo, success is 
elusive. </p>
<p><b>Systems</b>: To understand the difficulty of influencing unconscious choice &#8211; 
necessary for success in any sort of change (buying, change management, decision 
facilitation, etc.) &#8211; we must recognize it as a systems problem: since change 
involves some sort of insult to our internal and unconscious system/status quo, 
any change must include buy-in of everything within the system that will touch 
the final solution or the system will resist. It&#8217;s the principle of homeostasis 
&#8211; systems maintain equilibrium, and change without buy-in puts the system out of 
balance. We are all familiar with the repercussions of what happens when 
unconscious issues rear their ugly heads during implementations or group 
decisions. </p>
<h2>FACILITATIVE QUESTIONS </h2>
<p>Eventually I developed a new type of question: Facilitative Questions clarify 
and capture the appropriate, most relevant decision criteria (sometimes 
unconscious) from a responder&#8217;s memory indices and make their appropriate 
systemic drivers conscious. These questions enable people to illuminate their 
own criterial issues necessary to include in new choices for systems congruency.
</p>
<p>Facilitative Questions: </p>
<ul>
	<li>open new choices and unlock the means to fix whatever issues stand between 
the responder and his own excellence; </li>
	<li>construct new decisions to act based on unconscious belief/values-based 
criteria; </li>
	<li>are non-manipulative; </li>
	<li>offer change agents a new skill to engage the right people, address the right 
problem, and manage change without resistance; </li>
	<li>eschew information exchange for systems intervention; </li>
	<li>eliminate resistance by eliciting commitment and buy-in at the very beginning of 
any project or initiative or buy cycle; </li>
	<li>enable responders (facilitated by sellers, change agents, negotiators, or 
coaches) to simultaneously uncover the unconscious core of the problem and 
create the necessary change. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Here&#8217;s a simple example of the differences between conventional questions and 
Facilitative Questions: </p>
<p><b>Information-based question</b> (conventional question used by a questioner to 
extract information or gather data for the questioner&#8217;s purposes): </p>
<p class="quote"><i>Why do you 
wear your hair like that?</i> </p>
<p>This is a biased question which extracts historic data 
from the responder&#8217;s memory according to the needs of the questioner, and may 
cause her to defend past decisions as the query might bump against underlying 
beliefs. The responder might have no idea of the reasons behind the question but 
certainly already knows the answer from a previous decision made. The question 
might feel invasive and her response will be commensurately biased. </p>
<p><b>Facilitative Question</b> (sequential navigational question used by a facilitator 
to help responders discover unconscious belief-based criteria): </p>
<p class="quote"><i>How would you 
know if it were time to reconsider your hairstyle?</i> </p>
<p>This question neutrally brings 
together several indices that might make the responder curious without 
resistant, offers him the curiosity to examine choices and change possibilities, 
and compares current choices with past and future choices &#8211; all without 
manipulation, bias, or data gathering, and with no potential threat to the 
current system. The questioner as the facilitator becomes the change 
agent/servant leader. </p>
<p>In the example above, the question How would you know if it were time to 
reconsider your hairstyle the words &#8216;how&#8217; &#8216;know&#8217; &#8216;if&#8217; &#8216;time&#8217; &#8216;reconsider&#8217; are 
all carefully placed and chosen to be resistance-avoidant, and directed to prior 
decisions while considering change and obligations. And most important, it 
doesn&#8217;t attack current or previous choices. </p>
<h2>THE COMPLETE MODEL </h2>
<p>Using Facilitative Questions, and incorporating my historic knowledge of 
systems, I then developed a decision facilitation model (called Buying 
Facilitation? as its initial use was in sales) that offers the ability to help 
others sequentially traverse their unconscious indices and design creative 
answers that weren&#8217;t originally obvious. Used and formulated most effectively, 
Facilitative Questions follow a specific sequence that makes change comfortable 
and resistance-free. </p>
<p>Think of Buying Facilitation? as a GPS system that knows the (systems) 
coordinates and can navigate people to their exact destination without needing 
to know the type of function the car is headed. A type of systems thinking model 
that initially ignores the information we are so accustomed to. So a 
facilitator, seller, or coach would first be neutral navigators that unwrap the 
unconscious and achieves buy-in, then uses conventional questions to gather and 
introduce specific data points. </p>
<p>The skills necessary for Buying Facilitation? include those people don&#8217;t 
normally possess or deliberately use together (As a person with a form of 
Asperger syndrome, my brain does this naturally.): </p>
<p><b>Listening for systems</b>: we naturally listen for content and information. To 
formulate Facilitative Questions, it&#8217;s necessary to listen neutrally for the 
underlying metamessages where the unconscious lie and eschewing content. Later 
in conversations, listening for content is imperative. </p>
<p><b>Presumptive summaries</b>: people often don&#8217;t consciously recognize the import of 
what they are saying. By offering a type of summary statement that delineates 
the underlying meaning behind the words &#8211; what is meant vs what is said - the 
responder gets help unwrapping unconscious drivers. </p>
<p><b>Decision sequencing</b>: there are 3 stages to all decisions. Asking Facilitative 
Questions in the order of the stages enables people to face change without 
resistance and include the criteria necessary for congruency. </p>
<p>My clients have achieved great success with the model: buyers buy in half the 
time as they immediately enlist the proper Buying Decision Teams and uncover 
their personal buy-in criteria; teams go through change implementations with 
collaboration and creativity and avoid resistance; leaders get buy-in and 
participation for initiatives easily; facilitators find the core of issues 
quickly. It&#8217;s a servant leader model: people are self-motivated to find their 
own best answers, and become willing to make congruent changes in a very short 
time. Change with integrity: no external coercion, persuasion or advocacy. </p>
<h2>FACILITATING CHANGE </h2>
<p>The big idea here is the switch from seeking or pushing specific data to 
being a neutral navigator to lead a responder through her own values and systems 
structure toward a potential willingness to change while maintaining systems 
congruence. The differences are important: </p>
<ul>
	<li>from seeking and pushing content to facilitating the person&#8217;s own discovery 
of beliefs, values, identity issues and systemic drivers; </li>
	<li>from manipulation to servant leadership and neutral navigator; </li>
	<li>from pushing into a closed system to being accepted into a foreign system as a 
change agent; </li>
	<li>from bias and resistance to participation and creativity;</li>
	<li>from directing change 
and creating resistance to discovery, buy-in and participation. </li>
</ul>
<p>
To use Facilitative Questions and Buying Facilitation? requires a different sort 
of thinking and a different level of control. It requires that your outcome be 
to truly serve the other, to help her initiate and manage change from within &#8211; 
not with any content or directive from you, but true buy-in from her. Obviously 
your intent will shift as will your success: your sales, initiatives, 
implementations, and projects will be easier, shorter, and less costly. </p>
<p>What would you need to know or believe differently to be willing to add a new 
questioning technique to your already superb questioning skills? How would you 
know that adding a new skill set would be worth the time/effort/cost to make you 
&#8211; and your clients - even more successful? </p>
