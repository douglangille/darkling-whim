Accomplishing &quot;Just One Thing&quot; Gives You Permission to Relax</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Jeff Beals</i></p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>I have a lot of favorite words, and among them are &quot;three-day weekend.&quot; <br>
</p>
<p>Like most Americans, I'm looking forward to the upcoming Labor Day holiday. 
After all, who doesn't enjoy an extended weekend at the ceremonial close of 
summer? Picnics, vacations, camping/hiking, sporting events or just taking it 
easy at home - whatever you have planned for the three-day weekend, I hope you 
enjoy it. <br>
</p>
<p>But as much as I like a nice break, I must confess that holidays can 
sometimes make me a bit restless. Sleeping in, gluttonous indulging and 
taking-it-easy can eventually be too much. I like to accomplish at least a 
little something even during my time off. But what can you do when your clients, 
prospects and co-workers are preoccupied with fun and relaxation? <br>
</p>
<p>If you're a restless professional who wants to check a couple low-stress 
items off your list this weekend, consider the following:<br>
</p>
<h2>Update Your Social Media<br>
</h2>
<p>Whether you are a business person looking for clients or a professional 
seeking a new opportunity, you need to be visible. The quickest, easiest and 
cheapest way to do that is to maximize your social media profiles, especially 
LinkedIn. More and more buyers are finding their vendors through LinkedIn. More 
and more employers use LinkedIn for their recruiting. <br>
</p>
<p>If you tinker with your LinkedIn profile, pay particular attention to a few 
key areas:<br>
</p>
<p>Do you have a headshot photo of yourself on your profile? I'm amazed how many 
users do not. People are drawn to the faces of other people. If we don't see 
your face on your profile, we may be less apt to trust the information you 
provide or we may assume that you don't take your LinkedIn profile very 
seriously.<br>
</p>
<p>Make sure your summary statement is fully developed and explains what you do 
in detail using highly expressive words. <br>
</p>
<p>As long as they wouldn't have a problem with it, include the names of some of 
your best clients.<br>
</p>
<p>On LinkedIn's &quot;Skills &amp; Expertise&quot; section, choose words (you can have up to 
50) that describe your abilities. Don't be modest here. The more key words in 
your profile, the better it will perform for you.<br>
</p>
<p>Go out and deliberately &quot;endorse&quot; your connections for their skills and 
expertise. In turn, many of those people will feel compelled to endorse you 
back. <br>
</p>
<p>Testimonials give you credibility. Contract your happiest clients or your 
biggest supporters at work and ask them to write testimonials for you. It also 
helps to do this for others. Not only does it spread goodwill, but your name 
will get extra exposure by appearing on their LinkedIn profiles. <br>
</p>
<p>Of course, many professionals derive great benefit from other forms of social 
media as well. Therefore, you might want to take time to create and/or update 
your profiles on Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, and the list goes on...<br>
</p>
<h2>Reading Time<br>
</h2>
<p>A disturbingly large number of professionals completely give up on reading 
books the day they leave college. Many don't even read articles that would keep 
them up-to-date with their profession. While this is problematic, I do 
understand it. Time-starved professionals can feel guilty taking time to read. 
Plus, after years of being forced to read in school, some people have simply had 
enough. <br>
</p>
<p>Despite any negative connotations reading may conjure in your mind, you would 
be well served to peek at a trade publication or read a book that will motivate 
you and update your knowledge. Holiday downtime is a great time for reading. 
It's easier to learn and comprehend when you're not under any pressure. <br>
</p>
<h2>Organization<br>
</h2>
<p>A long weekend is a good time to clean up your life. You may want to go 
through your paper and electronic piles and prune what you no longer need. Is 
there something you have been keeping on the backburner too long? If so, you 
could figure out how to move it up when you return to the office.<br>
</p>
<p>If you work in sales or business-development, you might want to go through 
your list of prospects and find some who have cooled off or drifted away from 
you. Ask yourself if it makes sense to reconnect with these people. If so, plan 
to contact them middle of next week. <br>
</p>
<h2>Lunch or Coffee<br>
</h2>
<p>Scan your contact list and see if there is an important person you have 
neglected for awhile. That person could be a client, prospective client, 
industry leader, community leader or someone who could help you advance in your 
career. Invite that person to have coffee or lunch with you in the next couple 
of weeks. You never know what could come from the conversation. <br>
</p>
<h2>Goal Check<br>
</h2>
<p>Here's one final thing to consider for this otherwise relaxing weekend: a 
goal check. The year is now two-thirds complete. A quick check of your 2013 
goals can give you focus for the final third of this fast-moving year. Whether 
you are on, behind or ahead of schedule, think what you need to do over the next 
four months to make sure 2013 is a big success for you. <br>
</p>
<h2>A Closing Disclaimer<br>
</h2>
<p>I will confess some hesitation about writing this article, because I don't 
want anyone to get the wrong idea. <br>
</p>
<p>Many people are under incredible stress these days. There is so much pressure 
to perform at the office, and frankly, many of my readers already work too hard. 
I'm not advocating that you ruin your holiday weekend. <br>
</p>
<p>I just wanted to write some advice for people like me - people who love time 
off but feel uneasy if they're not accomplishing anything. If that describes 
you, consider some advice from one of my friends. He's a good guy and a 
hard-working entrepreneur. He has kids at home who require his time and 
attention each evening and on weekends. His rule is, &quot;I just have to do one 
thing.&quot; Each evening/weekend day, he forces himself to do one thing related to 
his work. It can be something minor and quick, but as soon as that one thing is 
done, he gives himself permission to have fun with his family. <br>
</p>
<p>Maybe that approach might work for you too. </p>
