<h1>Data, Technology and the Psychology of Social Behaviors: How Obama 
&#8216;socialized&#8217; politics</h1>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="../articles.htm">Guest articles</a> &gt; Data, Technology and the Psychology of Social Behaviors: How Obama 
&#8216;socialized&#8217; politics</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Lisa Peyton</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHY was Obama&#8217;s campaign SO effective? I recently ran across two quotes that 
answer that question and have much broader implications for the future of 
digital media. The first was from Pamela Rutledge, in her article &#8216;How Obama Won 
the Social Media Battle in the 2012 Presidential campaign&#8217;. She summed it up 
this way, &#8220;An effective social media campaign is based on the psychology of 
social behaviors NOT the current technology&#8221; (Rutledge, p. 2013). Mybo.com was 
able to take advantage of new technologies surrounding online social networks in 
order to enable Obama supporters to connect and build social relationships. The 
second quote was from the Handbook of mobile communication studies, chapter 17 
by Howard Rheingold. He eloquently puts it this way: </p>
<p>Communication technologies and literacies possess a power that has, on many 
occasions, proven mightier than physical weaponry &#8212; the potential to amplify, 
leverage, transform, and shift political power by enabling people to persuade 
and inform the thoughts and beliefs of others. </p>
<p>Obama recruited a variety of tools that allowed his supporters to easily find 
and inform undecided voters.</p><h2>
Recruiting Advocates </h2>
<p>one of the most powerful tools was the &#8216;Neighbor to Neighbor&#8217; campaign. The 
Obama team effectively launched &#8216;Neighbor to Neighbor&#8217; canvassing that enabled 
supporters to easily find and connect with undecided voters via walk and call 
lists. These lists were organized under a personalized Mybo.com dashboard that 
walked the user through the entire process. Not only was the campaign taking 
advantage of the free labor of volunteers to carry out this work, it also 
carried the power of &#8216;word of mouth&#8217; or 3rd party validation. In other words, 
Obama wasn&#8217;t pushing his own message; it was coming from his supporters. By 
allowing volunteers to connect with undecided voters or neighbors with whom they 
ALREADY had a relationship, a positive outcome was much more likely. Research 
has demonstrated what has been dubbed the &#8216;foot-in-the-door&#8217; phenomenon which 
indicates that social influence occurs when interpersonal relationships are 
present (Joinson, A., chap. 18, 2007). </p>
<p>Mybo.com was also able to capitalize on social influence by hosting over 
20,000 online groups. These groups brought together self-identified supporters 
that also had other criteria in common like geographic location, profession, 
hobbies and interests. By allowing supporters to participate in online 
communities via an identifiable profile, they were more likely to succumb to 
group norms and comply with campaign demands (Joinson, A., chap. 18, 2007).</p>
<h2>
Behavioral Targeting Trumps Traditional Ad Buys </h2>
<p>During the 2012 election social technologies had come of age and the Obama&#8217;s 
campaign manager described the campaign as &#8220;the most data-driven campaign ever&#8221; 
(Rutenberg, J, 2013). Success was also driven by advanced methods of targeting 
undecided voters using data from social sources and finding the BEST vehicle to 
deliver the campaign message. In a fascinating NY Times article, Rutenberg dives 
into the dirty details around how the Obama tech team was able to provide such 
accurate and efficient targeting. The article describes campaign staffers 
sifting through self-described supporters Facebook pages in search of friends 
who might be on the campaign&#8217;s list of most persuadable voters. They would then 
try to determine how close the connection was and recruit the supporter to 
contact their Facebook friend. These same means were leveraged to provide 
micro-targeting techniques for huge TV ad buys, saving the campaign millions of 
dollars by spending less but reaching a more qualified audience.</p><h2>
Unfair Advantage? </h2>
<p>This data-driven campaigning does raise the question: Does having access to 
the data give an unfair advantage? Established political parties and incumbants 
have ALWAYS had an advantage in our system. I campaigned for Jerry Brown for 
President back in the early 90&#8242;s and the established democratic pick &#8211; Clinton &#8211; 
used every trick in the book to thwart our efforts. The two party system in the 
US has always granted HUGE advantages to those two parties &#8211; like easily getting 
on the ballot. </p>
<p>I would posit that technology is now shifting the paradigm of those 
advantages a bit. Perhaps not opening up the floodgates for 3rd parties but 
allowing for the more fringe elements of the major parties to organize and be 
heard. Clearly Obama outpaced both Romney and McCain when it came to using 
technology. The long-established offline benefits of being an established 
candidate such as large corporate donors, paid (local) campaign staffers and 
national ad campaigns were trumped by a more bottom-up approach that was enabled 
by social media. </p>
<p>In the end, Obama won out by understanding the underlying psychological 
social needs that are met by social network sites and leveraging them to help 
spread the word. He also recruited a team of data analysts that were able to use 
the data afforded by social platforms to micro-target undecided and persuadable 
voters. Facebook allowed the campaign access to huge amounts of data, presumably 
for the &#8216;good&#8217; cause of informing voters, etc. This does make one ask how such 
tactics could be used for far more nefarious purposes by groups that aren&#8217;t as 
malevolent. Several of Obama&#8217;s tech team have been hired by private firms 
post-election, most notably Caesar&#8217;s Palace in Las Vegas. Any bets on whether or 
not Facebook will allow THEM access to information about who has &#8216;liked&#8217; the 
gamblers anonymous page? ;-) </p>
