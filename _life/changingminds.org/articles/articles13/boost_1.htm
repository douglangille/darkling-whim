Boost Your Personal Effectiveness &#8211; Part 1</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Deb Calvert</i></p>
<p><br>
I&#8217;m not talking in this post about intelligence, imagination, experience, past 
achievement, hard work, wealth, popularity or good luck. Those are all nice to 
have. But none of them &#8211; not even all of them &#8211; ensures that you will be 
effective in what you set out to do. Effectiveness is a wholly separate topic, 
one that doesn&#8217;t get much attention. That&#8217;s why we over-rely on all those other 
attributes as we strive to become more effective. When we fail or if we don&#8217;t 
feel endowed with those qualities, we give up. </p>
<p>But learning to be effective isn&#8217;t all that difficult. Like anything, it 
requires awareness, effort and time to form some new habits. Since this is a big 
topic, one that I feel is pretty important, we&#8217;ll break it down into two blog 
posts. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what it means to be effective. Simply put, personal effectiveness is 
the ability to get things done. Effectiveness is not efficiency &#8211; it&#8217;s about 
doing things well rather than doing things fast. Effectiveness is what raises 
your personal levels of performance, achievement and satisfaction. Effectiveness 
is a skill, not a personality trait. Therefore, it can be learned. </p>
<p>To be more effective, you must master certain habits and behaviors. There are 
10 key habits to start with. In this post, we&#8217;ll cover the first five. To 
maximize your personal effectiveness, you will want to work on all 10 over time. 
But working on just one in the short-term will increase your effectiveness 
incrementally. Pick one habit that you feel comfortable working on and start 
there. </p>
<h2>Be wise in evaluating the choices you make </h2>
<p>A decision is a judgment. It&#8217;s a choice between alternatives. Most choices 
are not about absolutes like right vs. wrong. Usually, there are just different 
courses of action to consider. </p>
<p>Starting with opinions instead of starting with facts gives you a chance to 
gauge how much emotion you are dealing with. If you ask for others&#8217; initial 
feelings about a matter, you&#8217;ll liberate members of your team (family, social 
circle) to say what they are thinking rather than feeling that the facts you&#8217;ve 
outlined are a predetermined course of action. </p>
<p>As you listen to opinions, sort through what is relevant to the choice you 
must make. Filter carefully so you don&#8217;t get caught up in emotions, rhetoric, or 
group think. Ask questions to be sure a choice is needed &#8211; maybe two solutions 
could co-exist or perhaps everyone could make their own choices in this matter. 
Making minor adjustments is easier than making wholesale changes&#8230; so consider 
the simple first. </p>
<p>Once you have made your choice, communicate it clearly and be firm about 
seeing it through. Never be &#8220;wishy-washy&#8221; because that will damage your 
credibility. But that doesn&#8217;t mean being rigid. If new information emerges or 
the situation changes, it will be time for a new decision. If you do change 
course, acknowledge that you were fully committed to the first choice and that 
you were wrong. Explain what new information has caused you to shift. </p>
<h2>Be credible in the way you speak and act </h2>
<p>Explain your decisions in a logical manner. Use facts, not emotions, as the 
basis for your decision. Even if you are making people-based decisions and must 
take into account the impact on people, weight the logical implications, too. Be 
comfortable enough with your own decision to take and answer questions about it.
</p>
<p>Avoid words like maybe, sort of, I think, I wonder&#8230; Speak decisively to 
inspire confidence. </p>
<p>Don&#8217;t dilute the effectiveness of your decisions by trying to please all the 
people all the time. Know that you will not be able to accomplish this and 
handle it correctly if you are trying to appease everyone with your decision.
</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t ignore the risks. Understand them and face them right away. Acknowledge 
them openly so others can see how you&#8217;ve looked at the whole situation. </p>
<p>Less is more &#8211; keep your messages simple and straightforward. Don&#8217;t hide 
information, but don&#8217;t feel like you have to go into great detail unless others 
ask. </p>
<h2>Show foresight </h2>
<p>Being effective and credible puts you in a position where others will seek 
your ideas and input. You can build on your effectiveness by becoming adept in 
predicting likely outcomes and troubleshooting to avoid likely problems. </p>
<p>Don&#8217;t ignore problems or dissension that bubbles up around you. Instead, when 
everything seems to be going well, have the foresight to ask about potential 
threats and to continually look for new and better ways to do things. Being 
complacent may mean that you&#8217;ll get blindsided when it&#8217;s too late to adjust. </p>
<p>Showing foresight doesn&#8217;t require a crystal ball. It does require staying 
engaged with others, asking questions and listening to their input. Value and 
seek others&#8217; opinions as often as possible. </p>
<h2>Deal with problems confidently </h2>
<p>There will be problems in your life and in your workplace. Falling apart 
isn&#8217;t an effective way of dealing with those problems. </p>
<p>To deal more effectively with the problems you encounter, try this. Label 
your problems and deal with them in a </p>
<p>dispassionate manner. Focus first on solutions and later, privately, on 
emotions. Simply taking control will make you more effective. Here are five ways 
you can compartmentalize problems and deal with them: </p>
<ol>
	<li><b>Factual Problems</b> have an answer that is right or wrong. A little 
	research can usually get these problems resolved very quickly. Don&#8217;t stew 
	and brew about these. They aren&#8217;t worth the time. </li>
	<li><b>Operational Problems</b> pertain to systems, work practices, 
	processes or technology. Problems here, especially recurring ones, can run 
	really deep. It may take a long time to analyze this type of problem and 
	correct each layer. Don&#8217;t tackle these big problems alone. Involve the 
	people who are closest to the work and trust them with a fix. </li>
	<li><b>Tactical Problems</b> are the ones that may get in the way of 
	attaining your goals. These are the nuisance problems, the little fires you 
	put out in your day-to-day work. They steal your time and take your focus 
	away from what really matters. The best way to handle these problems is 
	proactively. You must anticipate these problems and solve them early on. 
	Don&#8217;t let these problems become your excuse for procrastinating on what&#8217;s 
	truly important. </li>
	<li><b>Strategic Problems</b> are related to the organization&#8217;s broadest 
	goals. You put the business or family at risk if you do not provide quick, 
	complete and adequate solutions. To avoid these problems, work on the habit 
	above called &#8220;Show Foresight&#8221; so you troubleshoot and anticipate problems.
	</li>
	<li><b>People Problems</b> are the hardest to deal with because we don&#8217;t 
	want to get involved in anything messy. In business, the majority of 
	problems that front-line managers deal with are people-related. This 
	includes decisions related to hiring, firing, moving, restructuring, 
	promoting, motivating, coaching, etc. Every one of these decisions has an 
	impact on a person and often on an entire team. Stalling on solutions to 
	people problems causes far more problems than directly dealing with them as 
	they arise. </li>
</ol>
<p>Many leaders lose their followers because they do not demonstrate confidence 
in solving problems. The confidence comes from being able to gauge the urgency 
and respond appropriately and from understanding the need to stabilize a 
situation before diagnosing it. </p>
<h2>Handle your mistakes honorably </h2>
<p>In order to be effective, you must be willing to make a mistake. </p>
<p>Sometimes, you have to act before you&#8217;re certain of the outcome. Some people 
avoid taking any action at all because they&#8217;re afraid of what will happen if 
they fail or make a mistake. Ultimately, they&#8217;re afraid of what people will say 
or think about us. It&#8217;s impossible to be effective if you simply stay in one 
place. </p>
<p>What we forget, especially in the glaring spotlight that a mistake feels like 
is that everyone makes mistakes and that it&#8217;s okay to make mistakes. Mistakes 
are an opportunity to learn. You will grow and become more effective if you 
occasionally make mistakes. </p>
<p>When you make a mistake, what matters most is how you handle it. Don&#8217;t blame 
others. Don&#8217;t deny that a mistake has been made. Don&#8217;t be defensive. Be 
accountable for it and describe what you&#8217;ve learned and will do differently the 
next time. People admire this response and will respect you when you own your 
own mistakes.</p>
