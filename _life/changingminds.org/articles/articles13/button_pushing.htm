Button Pushing!</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Carol Davis</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The question: What is it about BUTTONS that makes us all quiver in fear! Are 
buttons strictly defined as &#8216;words&#8217; we say or can they also be non-verbal as in 
kinetic or other various forms of communication? Just to make sure we are all on 
the same page, here are a few of the examples I am referring to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>As in response to something said; &#8220;Whatever&#8221;</li>
	<li>As in response to something, anything: &#8220;rolling of the eyes&#8221;</li>
	<li>As in response to &#8216;Whatever&#8217;: Outrage!</li>
</ul>
<p>
So, it seems regardless of who pushes your buttons and the type of button, 
words, looks, etc., if you have a button pushed, you are more than capable of 
attempting to return the favor. So what is it that causes us to suffer this at 
least if not more, than once a month? I know some who have this happen every 
time they go to work, come home from work and then there are others that will 
tell you, just looking at my teenager pushes both of our buttons.</p><p>
There are so many academic theories out there, but there is one underlying 
agreement; reaction to having your &#8216;button&#8217; pushed is an &#8216;AUTO-DEFENSE 
RESPONSE&#8217;. </p><p>
That means you do not even have to think about it. There are buttons you 
probably haven&#8217;t even discovered, but once you do you will never forget and 
defend it to the best of your ability for as long as you need to. Controlling 
how we feel and react to this &#8216;Auto-Defense Response&#8217; takes work, time and lots 
of effort.</p><p>
Cascading Adult-Child theory incorporates this defense response but goes one 
step further. The cause! Not historically, but here and now in the present. The 
theory concludes that the mere act of &#8216;reacting&#8217; as we do when buttons are 
pushed, takes place when our mental and intellectual status is either in the 
Child state or causes the Adult state to go into a Child state. How is this 
concluded? Any and all fears or phobias take place in the child state. Because a 
&#8216;button&#8217; or &#8216;buttons&#8217; are defensive to begin with, they are classified as Child 
state. </p><p>
Nearly all defense mechanisms take place when we are like &#8216;child&#8217; in our psyche. 
It is how we view and react to the oncoming issue that causes us to either lift 
ourselves from Child to Adult or remain in the Child state until something comes 
along to assist us back into the Adult state.</p><p>
Now that we have appropriately identified how our brains classify &#8216;Button&#8217; 
pushing, what is the trick to ensuring you survive the onslaught? THERE ARE NO 
EASY OUTS! This is really worth repeating, &#8216;there are no easy outs.&#8217; Exercising 
the ability to &#8216;Cascade back and forth from Adult to Child to Adult&#8217; takes work! 
The first word in the last sentence described the procedure to a tee. It takes 
exercise and patience. </p><p>
Journaling is by far the best resource you have, and a beginning. Journaling is 
the process of documenting from a historical POV (Point Of View) exactly what 
happened, when it happened, why it happened, how it happened. In addition, 
clearly identifying the &#8216;Button&#8217; or &#8216;Buttons&#8217; causing the feeling and/or 
reaction will help IQQ (Identify, Qualify and Quantify) this issue. At first you 
might be best off having the ability to record notes so that the moment is 
captured, or carry something to immediately make a few notes. This is considered 
<u><b>Phase 1</b></u> of this push to control your reactions. The process looks like this:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A push of your Button/Buttons takes place (you finish the sentence or 
conversation)</li>
	<li>You identify that a button has been pushed (This is done by recognizing that 
you reacted in some fashion and form)</li>
	<li>You identify when in the period of time it happened (How long into the 
conversation, what time of day, in real time or a dream, etc.)</li>
	<li>You identify what you were doing when it happened (What activity were you in 
or had just completed such as playing tennis, working at my desk, etc.)</li>
	<li>You do your best to identify why it happened (Was this as a result of 
something said, done or just in passing, etc.?)</li>
	<li>You identify who pushed your &#8216;button&#8217;/&#8217;buttons&#8217; (Knowing who caused this 
reaction is very important!)</li>
	<li>You identify where you were when this happened (What was your location when 
this happened; at work, playing in the park, sleeping, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>
You identify how many times this happened in relation to this single incident 
(This would be similar to counting how many times someone said something in one 
paragraph. You can identify this because you probably would say something like; 
ok, that&#8217;s enough, stop already, say that one more time and I&#8217;ll&#8230;)</p><p>
Do your best to capture the above as soon as possible after it happens? KEEP 
DOCUMENTING! Do not worry about trying to analyze or review. Give yourself 
anywhere from one to 3 weeks, journaling this specific situation as many times 
and as much as possible. Some people find it difficult to keep a separate 
journal, it is ok to do this in &#8216;diary&#8217; form, but that can cause extra work in 
the long run.</p><p>
After you have waited the 1 to 3 weeks, it is time to start your analysis. You 
are trying to establish a pattern of information. Sometimes it turns out the 
pushing is from a co-worker/supervisor and at other times, it might just be your 
&#8216;best friend.&#8217; Regardless of who or what caused your &#8216;button(s) to be pushed&#8217; 
much information about how to help yourself can be gleamed. Do not worry about 
resolving your reaction at this point, we are only trying to identify the source 
and root reaction.</p><p>
To this point we know there:</p><p>
&#8226; Is/are button/s that exist</p><p>
&#8226; Who/what pushed the button(s)</p><p>
&#8226; What the button(s) were</p><p>
The where and number of times can be useful information if you need to analyze 
for future. In the meantime, it is now time to try and figure out the WHY. By 
this we mean, why this is a &#8216;button or buttons&#8217; situation. Unless you are an 
observer, absolutely not involved with either side (the pusher or the receiver) 
the why will not come right away! Instead, the why will work its way up thru 
your subconscious into your conscious little by little, until one day it sort of 
smacks you in the face as in &#8220;epiphany&#8221; and we are not talking months, years or 
lifetime. This process works rapidly, usually within several days to a couple of 
weeks once you start the journaling process! That means, even if you are only 
into your 3rd week of journaling, the process has already started! Your 
subconscious has already began to exercise and little by little, the exercise 
strengthens the ability to bring issues to the surface.</p><p>
Now the <u><b>Phase 2</b></u> begins. The phase where you might become uncomfortable. This is 
where you have inklings of what the root cause of reacting to a button/buttons 
might be. Continuation of exercise is vital and just because a couple of weeks 
journaling has taken place, does not mean you should stop. You need to continue 
exercising that part of the brain, otherwise you will have regression taking 
place (that is like beginning an exercise program, losing 10 pounds and saying 
to yourself, great now I can eat whatever I want). Your brain will start to 
identify the root cause and you should be including your feelings in your 
journal/diary all the while. Each week that passes by, you should go back and 
re-read that week. This reinforces the mental ability to work with this issue. 
It is here that at some point when the &#8220;epiphany&#8221; can start to work its magic 
and allow you to start building your &#8216;wall of resistance&#8217; to those buttons.</p><p>
<u><b>Phase 3</b></u> is the final phase of this process. In this phase we can both understand 
internally what the buttons are and why we react when they are pushed. Now we 
can work towards not reacting in our Child state. Once the cause of our 
discomfort is established, and again with the exercise &#8216;thing&#8217;, we can exercise 
our ability to remind ourselves; the root cause of my discomfort associated with 
this button/buttons, is in the past, it cannot and will not affect me in the 
future. I am empowered to allow it to pass by me without a thought or worry. No 
you do not have to memorize the above! You need to put it into your own words 
and commit to writing it, BY YOUR HAND, not on the computer! Time and Time 
again, writing in your own hand has proven to be a VERY, VERY IMPORTANT tool the 
brain uses to remember and work! </p><p>
There can be no guarantees this will work. It is a successful tool. BUT not all 
associations can be as easily corrected. If you find after DILLIGENT work has 
been put forth, and you are COMPLETELY HONEST with yourself that you have 
followed the above, your specific button is still being pushed, you will need 
external assistance moving from the Child state! </p><p>
DO NOT GIVE UP ON YOURSELF! You deserve to not have buttons! You deserve to be 
reaction free, if you so choose! The last word on this;</p><p class="quote">
&quot;remember buttons are a mere reflection of unresolved issues still lingering 
within our brains. They deserve&#8230;, we deserve to set them free and in doing so, 
we are set free!&quot;</p><p>
