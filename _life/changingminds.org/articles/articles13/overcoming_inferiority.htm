Overcoming Inferiority Complex</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Saif Farooqi</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each and every person has certain needs and desires, which he/she would like 
to fulfil. Many a times some of these needs become difficult to accomplish due 
to a number of reasons. This develops a sense of helplessness and makes the 
person feel powerless to a certain degree. When this happens, the individual is 
very likely to feel inferior.</p><p>
This feeling of inferiority occurs in everybody, some time or the other. It is 
quite normal and natural to have this feeling. There is nothing wrong in it. 
There are times when an individual may be able to overcome the feeling of 
inferiority, but it may also be resurfaced once certain new needs develop.</p><p>
According to Alfred Adler, the feeling of inferiority develops due to the innate 
human tendency of striving for superiority. Each and every individual strives 
for superiority. This tendency is so overwhelming that as soon as there is some 
obstruction that comes in between the person and his/her needs then he/she 
begins to feel inferior.</p><p>
It is a blessing in disguise to feel inferior because in a way it can help to 
move forward in life. The striving for superiority makes sure that the person 
puts in all his/her effort and work harder to fulfill his/her needs and overcome 
the sense of helplessness and powerlessness. Thus, the striving for superiority 
causes inferiority as well as helps in overcoming it.</p><p>
It is alright if there is some control over the feeling of inferiority and it 
occurs within a certain limit. The problem arises when it becomes too pervasive. 
When the feeling of inferiority occurs too often and becomes persistent, then it 
may lead the person to develop into inferiority complex.</p><p>
Inferiority complex makes an individual feel worthless and instills within 
him/her a sense of hopelessness. The person begins to feel that he/she lacks 
certain qualities and is inferior to others with respect to those qualities. Due 
to an inferiority complex, the normal feelings of incompetence get exaggerated, 
which makes the individual feel that it is impossible to achieve goals and/or 
have certain abilities.</p><p>
For instance, an average or below average student might try hard to score well 
in his/her examination. Due to his/her continuous failure in doing that he/she 
might feel inferior to others and think that it is impossible to compete with 
his/her peers, which in turn makes him/her feel worthless.</p><p>
Inferiority complex may not necessarily develop in the context of specific tasks 
or goals. It may develop for more general or abstract things also. For example, 
a person might feel that he/she is not very good looking compared to others and 
this might become the cause for inferiority complex for that person.</p><p>
Likewise, if a person is unable to make friends then that person might feel that 
nobody likes him/her and that he/she lacks the qualities of having good friends. 
Also, if a person, compared to others, is confused about his/her goals in life 
then he/she might begin to feel insecure and think that he/she is good for 
nothing. This continuous feeling can cause an inferiority complex.</p><p>
Inferiority complex can become a menace for the individual and can lead to many 
other problems. The person might develop a feeling of inadequacy. He/she might 
also have disappointment, dissatisfaction, depression, fearfulness, shyness, 
worrisome, self-pity, insecurity, loneliness, withdrawal, etc.</p><p>
If inferiority complex becomes too overwhelming and lasts for a longer period of 
time, there is a possibility that it may engulf the person in such a strong way 
that it gets fabricated into superiority complex. Superiority complex is nothing 
but an exaggerated form of inferiority complex. When a person develops too much 
of inferiority complex, then it turns into superiority complex.</p><p>
In superiority complex, the individual feels that a good way to overcome 
inferiority is to make others feel inferior and thus become superior. For this, 
the person might become arrogant and aggressive in his/her mannerisms. He/she 
might try to show off and indulge into too much of self-praise and bragging. The 
person might also try to bully others to gain a sense of satisfaction.</p><p>
The person does all this in an effort to regain his/her lost self-worth. He/she 
tries to seek the attention of others and pretends to be something that he/she 
actually is not. The individual tries to convince and prove himself/herself as 
well as others that he/she is not inferior. He/she also tries to think of 
himself/herself as someone who is highly valuable and probably the best.</p><p>
Such a person might seem to be very confident from the outside. He/she might 
appear to hold a very high opinion of himself/herself. But, this may not be the 
case in actuality. The person is just trying to hide his/her shortcomings and 
tries to overcome his/her excessive feelings of inferiority.</p><p>
This attitude is perceived as obnoxious and rude by others. By getting into such 
behaviour, the person might also be making a fool out of him/her. Others begin 
to extremely dislike him/her and try to stay away. This further exacerbates the 
feeling of worthlessness within that person. It may also lead to more and more 
aggressive behaviour or even chronic loneliness and depression.</p><p>
The best way to overcome inferiority complex, according to Adler, is 
compensation. If a person feels that he/she lacks in a certain ability, then 
that person can try to develop strength in some other ability. The individual 
can enhance such skills that make him/her feel good about himself/herself and 
develop self-confidence. In this way, the person feels that it does not matter 
if he/she lacks in a particular ability because he/she is very good in some 
other ability.</p><p>
For instance, a person who feels that he/she is not good in studies can become 
good in sports. A person who feels that he/she is not good looking can become 
very good in studies and other intellectual endeavours. A person who feels that 
he/she does not have a good speaking ability can develop good skills in writing 
or painting. In this way an individual can compensate his/her lack of ability by 
developing and enhancing some other ability.</p><p>
Another way to overcome inferiority complex is to have a high level of 
self-awareness. A high level of self-awareness will enable the person to know 
himself/herself in a much better way. Due to this an individual can recognize 
his/her strengths and weaknesses and work accordingly. If the person realizes 
his/her strengths and true abilities, then there is no way that the person could 
develop an inferiority complex.</p><p>
Many people become too much sensitive about what other people feel or think 
about them. They begin to worry a lot about how others see them. This is 
completely unnecessary and a waste of time. Rather than worrying about what 
others are thinking, it is much better to focus on what we want to do.</p><p>
An individual knows himself/herself better. If a person goes according to others 
then there is a possibility that the person might get into things in which 
he/she lacks proper ability. This may cause constant failures and eventually 
lead to inferiority complex.</p><p>
Comparing oneself to others also does no good to the person. If a person is good 
in something that does not mean that another individual also has to be good in 
that. The individual might have his/her own strengths and should focus on that. 
Trying to ape others can be misguiding and lead to insecurity, which may further 
develop into inferiority complex.</p><p>
The feeling of inferiority can be a good thing for an individual until and 
unless it is not exaggerated. Inferiority complex is obviously something that 
can cause a lot of troubles to a person.</p><p>
The longer inferiority complex stays the worse it gets. Therefore, a person 
should do his/her best to overcome it once he/she develops it. Rather than 
overcoming it would be much better if an individual uses his/her thought 
processes in an appropriate manner and try to dissociate himself/herself from 
inferiority complex as much as possible.</p><p>
