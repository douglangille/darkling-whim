&#8216;Launch&#8217; Author Michael Stelzner Teaches Businesses to Grow by Being Generous</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Lisa Peyton</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his latest book, &#8216;Launch: How to Quickly Propel Your Business Beyond the 
Competition&#8217;, Michael Stelzner dismisses traditional marketing messages and 
triumphs giving the gift of great content. He believes people and prospects want 
valuable insight, access to great people and recognition before they want 
products and services. Therefore, building trust with your potential customer is 
more important than your products and services. </p>
<p>Read on to discover Michael&#8217;s prescription for growing and marketing your 
business without employing traditional marketing tactics. He walks the reader 
through the step-by-step process of growing a business through generosity and 
cultivation of great content.</p><h2>
The Elevation Principle and a Simple Equation </h2>
<p>&#8216;Launch: How to Quickly Propel Your Business Beyond the Competition&#8217; is based 
on something Michael calls the Elevation Principle. Simply put, this principle 
is the process of meeting the core desires of prospects and customers by helping 
them solve their basic problems AT NO COST. The idea is that by gifting your 
prospects with free information, you will earn their trust and they will have a 
higher likelihood of considering you when they are ready to make a purchase. </p>
<p>This strategy requires business owners and marketers to rely less on 
marketing messages that only drive sales. Instead, they are asked to generously 
solve the problems of their potential customers without asking for anything in 
return by creating valuable content. This is great news for content creators, 
like myself, who thrive on producing articles that educate their reader base. 
However, it&#8217;s far too easy to get lost in all that content and forget WHO you&#8217;re 
writing for and WHY. Michael lays out a detailed plan to help leverage the value 
of great content in order to grow your business. </p>
<p>If you aren&#8217;t currently in the business of creating content and question the 
value of giving away something for free &#8211; READ THIS BOOK. Michael clearly and 
concisely lays out a solid argument for ditching marketing messages in favor of 
a strategy based upon his &#8216;elevation principle.&#8217; He outlines case studies that 
prove his point and should put to rest worries about investing in great content.
</p>
<p>In its simplest form, this theory looks like this:</p><p class="quote">
<i>Great content + other people &#8211; marketing message = growth</i></p><h2>
Your Flight Path to &#8216;Out of this World&#8217; Results </h2>
<p>Using the metaphor of a rocket ship maneuvering through space, Michael helps 
the reader navigate a solid flight path. Once you&#8217;ve decided to employ the 
elevation principle, it&#8217;s time to refine your &#8216;vision statement.&#8217; A vision 
statement is &#8216;a sentence or 2 that helps keep you focused during moments of 
uncertainty.&#8217; It should answer the question: Where do I ultimately want my 
business to be?&#8217; Your vision statement is something that will help you make 
decisions and ensure you&#8217;re staying on course. It&#8217;s not recommended that you 
rush this part of the process, but work to truly uncover what it is you want out 
of your business. </p>
<p>After your vision statement has been completed, it&#8217;s time to set those SMART 
goals we&#8217;ve all heard so much about. </p>
<p>SMART Goals: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Specific</li>
	<li>Measurable</li>
	<li>Attainable</li>
	<li>Relevant</li>
	<li>Time-bound (put them on the calendar) </li>
</ul>
<p>Michael does an excellent job at walking the reader through some examples of 
setting goals based on a vision statement. He recommends setting up &#8216;markers&#8217; or 
key accomplishments that will guide your business along its path to success.</p>
<p>Michael advises finding inspirational role models that inspire you to take 
your business to new places. These can be individual competitors, brands or any 
entity that has engaged you with its content. Inspirational and engaging content 
gives you ideas for your own business and these ideas need to be captured. Enter 
the Idea Vault. </p>
<p>An idea vault creates a place where ideas live and can be easily fetched. 
Recommended tools to help you capture your ideas include: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Bookmark sites, delicious, etc.</li>
	<li>Email folders</li>
	<li>Store on desktop &#8211; create folder of PDF&#8217;s</li>
	<li>Physical folders </li>
</ul>
<h2>Secret Sauce = Solving Your Readers&#8217; Problems </h2>
<p>Solving your prospects&#8217; problems without asking for anything in return will 
establish trust and make them LOVE you. Solving their basic problems is an easy 
concept to understand, but I would argue VERY few businesses actually put this 
into practice. The first question to be answered is WHO are you trying to reach? 
The more targeted your answer, the easier it is to create valuable content 
relevant to that group. </p>
<p>Michael lays out detailed information on how to build a profile for your 
ideal &#8216;people&#8217; base. He advises considering the following when determining your 
ideal base: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Industry focus &#8211; Does it make sense to target people in a specific industry?</li>
	<li>Topical interests &#8211; Does it make sense to focus on a few specific topics? (Make 
sure they have longevity.)</li>
	<li>Job title and function &#8211; Decide what is the most likely title for your target</li>
	<li>Company size &#8211; How big is the company size of your target and how are you 
quantifying size? Employees, revenue, etc.</li>
	<li>Geography &#8211; Should you focus on people in a particular location? 
	</li>
</ul>
<p>He then takes it a step further and asks you to answer the following 
questions: </p>
<ul>
	<li>What problems are they facing? Make a list.</li>
	<li>What is the nature of who you&#8217;re trying to reach? (Busy? Seeking new 
ideas?Skeptical?)</li>
	<li>How familiar are they with my topic?</li>
	<li>What are the desires of my user base? What do they really want? </li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have created a comprehensive persona or two, you can begin to 
actually visualize this person and truly uncover how to best meet their needs 
with your content.</p><h2>
Content! Content! Content! </h2>
<p>It&#8217;s all about content. But not just any content, ENGAGING, COMPELLING, 
OUTSTANDING content. So how you do you define GREAT content? It should include 
these essential elements: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Highly relevant</li>
	<li>Educational</li>
	<li>Easy to digest</li>
	<li>Visually appealing</li>
	<li>Conversation-igniting</li>
	<li>Lacks a sales angle </li>
</ul>
<p>Michael suggests creating an editorial guide and an editorial calendar to 
help keep you publishing content regularly. An editorial guide should outline 
the following: </p>
<ul>
	<li>For whom are you writing?</li>
	<li>Length of content</li>
	<li>Layout and formatting considerations </li>
</ul>
<p>He tapped Social Media Examiner&#8217;s managing editor, Cindy King, for tips on 
creating a solid editorial calendar: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Publish strongest content on days you have the most readers</li>
	<li>Look for variety in categories over the week/month</li>
	<li>Space out multiple authors</li>
	<li>Be flexible </li>
</ul>
<p>Along with these solid tips, working examples are provided to the reader and 
make creating these important assets fairly painless.</p><p>
Primary Fuel vs. Nuclear Fuel </p>
<p>Getting specific about the content you&#8217;ll want to publish, Michael 
categorizes your content into two types: Primary and Nuclear. Primary fuel is 
regularly published, free content that meets the needs of your reader base. The 
goal of your primary fuel is to help your readers solve their problems so they 
will become raving fans. Michael advises that the lifespan of primary fuel is 
about three days. The types of primary fuel include: </p>
<ul>
	<li>How-to articles</li>
	<li>Expert interviews</li>
	<li>Reviews</li>
	<li>News stories</li>
	<li>Case studies</li>
	<li>Contrarian stories </li>
</ul>
<p>Nuclear fuel is carefully designed content that has a lasting impact on 
significant numbers of your ideal reader base and possibly experts. This type of 
content has a lifespan easily exceeding that of primary fuel. It can sometimes 
be relevant for years. Nuclear fuel should always be free and includes: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Reports based on surveys</li>
	<li>White papers</li>
	<li>Top 10 contests</li>
	<li>Micro events (webinars, videos, podcasts) </li>
</ul>
<h2>Cage Your Marketing Messages, Be Generous and Your Business Will Grow </h2>
<p>The insights and advice I have outlined from Michael&#8217;s book are simply a 
launching pad for growing your business. If you&#8217;re looking to make the complete 
journey, invest in a copy and read it for yourself. It&#8217;s the type of book you&#8217;ll 
find yourself going back to throughout the process of growing a successful 
business. </p>
<p>Some may find it difficult to swallow the bitter pill that marketing messages 
no longer work and need to be scrapped. However, I have experienced how 
sales-driven content will bring community activity and growth to a screeching 
halt. Today&#8217;s landscape requires a different methodology and a paradigm shift 
away from TAKING to GIVING. I think we can all agree that we admire those who 
are generous. It&#8217;s time to apply that important principle to business.</p>
