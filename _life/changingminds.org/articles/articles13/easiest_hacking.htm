The Easier Form of Hacking: Social Engineering</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Stuart Gentry</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we talk about hacking, especially in today&#8217;s world, we hear the media 
giving us the stories of how hackers hack into a database and steal information 
from it, like this story. This is what the world hears about on a regular basis. 
How about the Stuxnet worm and Flame? Another example of malicious code hitting 
systems, stealing information, causing malfunctions, and the list goes on. The 
one thing society does not hear a lot about is how social engineering can play a 
huge part in hacking. In this article, we will look at how social engineering is 
one of the easier forms of hacking and what one can do to guard against these 
type of attacks. </p>
<p>To borrow from the world renowned hacker Kevin Mitnick in his book &#8220;Ghost in 
the Wires&#8221;, Mr. Mitnick utilized social engineering throughout the book. Mr. 
Mitnick would call telephone companies and ask for access to their networks by 
playing different roles, and receive them effortlessly! Even as a kid he asked a 
bus driver where he could buy a punch used for punching bus transfer tickets. 
Then, he bought a punch and found partly used blank bus transfer stubs in a 
dumpster to ride around San Fernando Valley for free; yet another form of social 
engineering. Mr. Mitnick was a professional social engineer as a kid all the way 
up to when he was caught. </p>
<p>Even today, he still performs social engineering in an ethical manner with 
his own penetration testing company which he talks about in the opening of 
&#8220;Ghost in the Wires.&#8221; Kevin Mitnick points something out to all of us: social 
engineering has been around for a while, and you only need to think about your 
surroundings and do reconnaissance on your target to figure out a way to get to 
information. </p>
<p>People say, &#8220;It would never happen to me, I wouldn&#8217;t fall for something like 
that.&#8221; The scary part is, technology is becoming more sophisticated to the point 
of where we will give money away without a second thought. For example, I heard 
of a situation where a woman, I&#8217;ll call Shelly, was &#8220;called&#8221; by her grandson 
Ralph in Brazil stating he needed money to get out of jail. Shelly said it 
sounded just like Ralph and she went to get the money to transfer it to the 
account she was given for his release. When she went to the local grocery store 
to accomplish the transfer, she was stopped by the clerk who asked some 
questions before performing the transaction; coincidentally, there had been a 
couple of other customers getting ready to perform a similar transaction for a 
loved one to the same account. Shelly could not believe it; it sounded like 
Ralph on the phone call. Feeling very distraught, she phoned her son Ben and 
asked if Ralph was there, &#8220;Yes, he&#8217;s sitting right here next to me.&#8221; Shelly was 
relieved, but still could not believe she was almost lured into a scam. </p>
<p>Shelly was fortunate the clerk questioned the transaction before it happened. 
She now knows the next time she receives a phone call like this, she will 
contact the person to verify how legitimate the phone call is. She could also 
have asked to get the phone number from where the call originated and called it 
back to verify it was legitimate, or asked the phone operator where the number 
originated from. </p>
<p>Another example of social engineering for account credentials is receiving an 
email with a link from a seemingly legitimate person or source (i.e. Bank of 
America). The email states you need to verify your credentials for your account 
and to click on the link which typically takes the user to a website that looks 
exactly like the website the user would see for their bank. However, if one were 
to look closer, it is not their bank&#8217;s website, but has a very close resemblance 
to it. Something as simple as www.bankof america.com could actually be 
www.bank0famerica.com; the only difference between URLs being the zero (0) in 
the &#8220;of&#8221; on the second URL. The reality is, people don&#8217;t look that close at the 
URL and I don&#8217;t blame them; however, the thought should cross a person&#8217;s mind to 
try calling the banking institution or individual to verify they really need 
this kind of information &#8211; they should not. </p>
<p>At some companies, employees are required to wear a badge, and if there is 
classified information behind closed doors, a personal identification number 
(PIN) may be required as well. In these situations, if the social engineer knows 
someone behind the door, they can always wait for someone with access to use 
their badge and say, &#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m Jane Doe and I&#8217;m doing business in there with Sam 
Smith, but I don&#8217;t have my badge with me today; can you let me through? It&#8217;s 
just this once.&#8221; Most people that I have witnessed will just let the person 
through the door without a second thought to help them out; they won&#8217;t even 
follow Jane Doe to her destination to ensure Sam Smith knows her&#8230;this can be a 
mistake. Of course, if no one questions Jane Doe while she is in the area, no 
one is the wiser for letting her go about her business. However, if the person 
badging through states, &#8220;Let me find Sam Smith, I know where he sits, and I will 
have him come get you.&#8221; This will likely case Jane Doe to think twice, and there 
is a good chance Jane Doe will not be there when Sam Smith goes to the door 
wondering who she is. </p>
<p>Another example of badge entry is one Mr. Mitnick utilized in his book where 
he searched the Internet to find the company&#8217;s website he was doing a 
penetration test for. Mr. Mitnick copied the company&#8217;s logo to make a very 
similar looking badge to the one worn by the employees. Utilizing his badge, he 
waited for the smokers to head in from their break. He went up tailgate the last 
smoker going inside, presented his badge, and was inside the building. The 
person looking at his badge did not really look up close; had he done so, Mr. 
Mitnick may not have gained access to the building. </p>
<p>An excellent way to social engineer and gain access to potentially valuable 
information is via USB thumbdrive. I&#8217;ve heard of a situation where a person 
wanted to get access to information from a company and just left USB drives 
around in the parking lot. Why? Inevitably, a naïve employee of the company will 
pick it up and want to know what is on the drive or who it belongs to. So, they 
decide to plug it into a company computer to look&#8230;voila, malicious code inserted 
and, if no HIDS or HIPS or antivirus detects anything; the person could have 
more than just one computer! They could own the network! If this happens to an 
employee, they should at least take the device to their security personnel and 
report what happened. </p>
<p>Social engineering is ever present on social media such as Facebook. People 
LOVE Facebook to the point of letting everyone know, &#8220;Going to Mom&#8217;s for the 
weekend! See you tonight Mom!&#8221; A person doesn&#8217;t even have to ask when they are 
going to be out of town or when they are leaving. Perfect opportunity to do some 
snooping around the house, try breaking in, etc. One other thing to notice, most 
people do not lock down their accounts, so you can peruse their friends and 
friends of friends, etc. to determine the ultimate target. Use a search engine 
such as Google to identify who they really are, such as CEO of a company (if 
they haven&#8217;t already posted that on their Facebook profile); find out their 
interests and hobbies; and potentially steal their identity. </p>
<p>People would say that no one would go to that length to get money from 
someone; you&#8217;d be surprised at how easy it can be as pointed out by the website 
http://blog.uspystore.com/2012/01/12/seven-easy-steps-to-steal-someones-identity/. Lesson on this one is do not tell the world you are leaving town for the 
weekend (or whenever); ensure your account is locked down to where only your 
friends can see your posts and tell your friends to lock down their accounts too 
for the same reason. Another security feature to consider enabling (under 
account settings from the drop down arrow, then select Security to the left hand 
side, and menu will drop down in the middle) is the Recognized Devices setting 
which allows you to restrict access to the account from only a specified computer(s) vs. from any computer&#8230;if a hacker gets your credentials, they can 
log on from anywhere and do whatever they want to your account. If a user clicks 
on the down arrow to the right of the home button and clicks on Help, Facebook 
actually provides valuable information on account settings for security and 
privacy settings. </p>
<p>I actually had an instance of social engineering for money happen to me a 
while back. I was trying to sell items on Craigslist and put pictures out for 
people to look at them. I would let them email me and then I would send my phone 
number to them if they were interested in an item. I had an item listed for 
about two weeks with no hits, then I finally got one. The person said they were 
interested, so I sent my phone number and said to call me to discuss looking at 
the item. The response was something to the effect of if you send the item to 
this state (California, I believe), I will send you the money once it is 
received&#8230;yes, OK, not going to happen. No, I did not respond, and 
coincidentally, neither did the other person (surprise). </p>
<p>Another instance of potential social engineering that I encountered comes 
from, in my opinion, small state/town mentality. I was staying at a hotel for a 
couple of days and went down to the bar one night to have an adult beverage. I 
paid for the beverage in cash, drank it, and went back to my room. Later when I 
returned from my trip, I was filing a voucher to cover trip expenses and looked 
at the hotel receipt. The receipt had a $20 charge for the hotel bar. Confused, 
I called the hotel and explained the situation; fortunately, they said they had 
mistakenly charged my room for a drink from another customer in another room. My 
coworker stayed at the same hotel and I explained what happened to which he 
responded, &#8220;Oh yeah, at the bar, all you needed to do is tell them your room 
number and they will charge it to the room.&#8221; So, if I were the social 
engineering type, I could have just watched someone go to their room, then 
ordered a drink and charged it to that room&#8230;how far I could go before the 
bartender said something or asked for my room number, who knows. </p>
<p>A more network savvy way of social engineering is utilizing applications like 
Wireshark to monitor a person&#8217;s wireless network activity. Observing the 
websites they visit and anything unencrypted can give clues to their interests 
and hobbies. This could give a social engineer enough information to spam an 
email or contact the person via phone and follow up with an email. Again, 
another potential entry way into the person&#8217;s computer and/or network. However, 
with some encryption on the wireless router and a good password, as well as 
password protecting the router&#8217;s administrative access, can divert the social 
engineer to another unprotected wireless network. </p>
<p>One final example of social engineering comes from the book, &#8220;Spies Among Us&#8221; 
by Ira Winkler. Mr. Winkler and his assistant were hired to do a penetration 
test for a nuclear power plant. In this account, Mr. Winkler and his assistant 
were able to obtain badges from the front desk of the headquarters facility 
without anyone verifying who they were or who signing off on the paper work for 
their badges. Then, they traveled to the actual nuclear reactors facility where, 
once inside the nuclear reactors facility, Mr. Winkler&#8217;s assistant plugged into 
the network and downloaded billions of dollars worth of nuclear information 
utilizing server names which Mr. Winkler obtained with a little more social 
engineering. </p>
<h2>Summary </h2>
<p>In summary, there are numerous ways to social engineer people including 
dressing and talking like company personnel. All workers should be schooled in 
how they can protect the company assets from being stolen by a slip of the 
tongue, giving into emotion, or feeling like they do not have the time to check 
a person out before giving them access or information. Now, granted we are all 
human and make mistakes, especially in the fast paced world we live in today. 
However, just caring and thinking about what one is doing can be enough to ask 
the person on the phone, &#8220;You want Mr. Doe? May I ask who is calling and get a 
number to have him call you back at?&#8221; Asking these questions could be enough to 
deter the social engineer to look for a different target.<br>
