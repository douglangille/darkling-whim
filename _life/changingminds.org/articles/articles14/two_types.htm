<h1>You will Always Find 2 Types of People</h1>

You will Always Find 2 Types of People</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Prakash Sutradhar</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In every country, culture, society, organization you'll come across these 
types of people. 1) Narcissist and 2) Bulldozer. They both have poison and 
deadly viruses. They can make you poisonous. Let's learn more about them...</p>
<h2>First Category: Narcissist </h2>
<p></p>
<p>Their only motto is Me, Me, Me, Me and Me. I am this, I am that, I have this, 
I own this, I can do this, I know these things, I am right &#8230; I am everything. 
Their only goal is self-promotion. They think very high of themselves. They 
think they are super special, they are unique, they are extraordinary. They want 
to be the center of every conversation, activities. They try to get the 
attention of the crowd.</p>
<p>They will tell stories of schooldays, how they led their team win that final 
match. They will promote all their achievements. In their stories, they are 
super lover than you, they are more intelligent than you, they are richer, they 
are the best advisor, they are more demanded than you. They exaggerate 
everything, they magnify all small incidents where they come out as a hero every 
time. For their listeners their life is full of interesting stories, they 
delivered different results by acting different roles every time.</p>
<p>They think their birthday is more special than your marriage, their new 
mobile is more cool than your MBA degree. They are all and they are nothing but 
jerk. </p>
<p>From outside they seem like super cool guy/girl but from inside they are 
empty. They have the fear of being overlooked, fear of being unimportant, fear 
of not recognized, fear of being ordinary. They don't even know that due to fear 
they act like a jerk but they think it's normal. Those feelings started in their 
childhood, if they were constantly ignored by their parents or peers, or if they 
were too shy to express their need. When they grow up they develop the habit of 
narcissism. Narcissism is self admiration. They are full of admiration for 
themselves, they behave like confident but they are overconfident. They have 
inflated ego, They give themselves overvalue. They overestimate their abilities. 
Their biggest enemies are those who underestimate them. They can't take 
slightest of the criticism. They burst out if anyone try to show them their 
fault. </p>
<p>They always need their followers who will listen to them. They feel 
frustrated if no one listens to them. With the booming of social media, they are 
now more visible everywhere. They will regularly update their photos, they will 
let everyone know their dinner menu, what they are doing, where they are going. 
They are proud of their followers in the social media, they love their body, 
their hairstyle, their brain, their ass and for them no matter what you do, you 
can't beat them. They need attention and their ego travels ahead of them. </p>
<h2>The Second Category: The Bulldozers </h2>
<p></p>
<p>Narcissist group sometime may seem cool but bulldozer category people are 
always super jerk. The are always annoying and big pain for others. </p>
<p>You might have heard many Akbar and Birbal stories in your childhood (Akbar 
was a great king of Mughal Empire in 16th century). Birbal was his most favorite 
and the cleverest minister. Akbar knew it very well that no one can fool Birbal. 
One story was of that, one day Akbar called Birbal to test his cleverness. In 
the floor, Akbar drew a line with chalk and asked Birbal to make that line small 
without touching it.<br>
</p>
<p>But as Birbal was very clever, he drew another line parallel to that line but 
longer than the Akbar's line.<br>
</p>
<p>And Birbal replied to the king, &#8220;Sir, your line has become smaller.&#8221; This 
story has a great moral that &#8220;we can always make us higher without depending on 
others.&#8221; But bulldozer category people misunderstood this story, and they took 
in opposite way. They follow the principle that </p>
<p class="quote"><i>&#8220;If you can't make yourself high, then make others smaller&#8221;.
</i></p>
<p>They always try to put others down, they always criticize, they always blame 
others. If you say to them &#8220;I came first in exams&#8221;, their reply will be &#8220;I heard 
that question paper was very easy&#8221;. If you say that I won gold medal in chess 
tournament, their reply will be &#8220;No one plays chess today&#8221;. If you say that I 
bought a new mobile phone, their reply will be &#8220;But it lacks these facilities, 
and it is over priced too&#8221;. If you tell them that my son got admission in 
university, their reply will be &#8220;But I read in the newspaper that your 
university ranks low &#8221;.. they don't miss any opportunity to make others feel 
that they are lower than them. Bulldozer category people also thinks that they 
are super special and they admire themselves but they lack the art of 
self-promotion, they don't know how to advertise themselves, so they choose the 
path of putting everyone down. </p>
<h2>Then What is the solution? </h2>
<h3>If you're an ordinary people like all of us then</h3>
<p>Just ignore them, don't give any value to their opinion, they are jerk and 
they will be jerk. They are doing this for their own psychological problems and 
you should not become prey to their problems. The more you'll avoid them the 
more you'll be safe from their poison. Trust me, your life and your well being 
is not dependent on them. </p>
<h3>If you're Narcissist then</h3>
<p>Just keep yourself obscure for a few days. Don't say, don't do anything other 
than your surviving activities like eating, breathing, studying, working. First 
understand that, narcissism is a disease and it not only affects you but also 
affecting your family members, friends. You annoy everyone with your so called 
cool life. Stop promoting yourself, and accept yourself as a normal human being 
like we all. You too have strengths and weaknesses as we all do have. You don't 
have to get recognition from everyone, you can have a better life without 
putting so much energy in promoting yourself. How much energy will be saved if 
you stop putting yourself every time high and use that energy in other important 
things like career, self development and family. </p>
<h3>If you're Bulldozer then</h3>
<p>Dude, your theory is wrong, you can't raise yourself up by putting others 
down. You will always be what you are irrespective of what others do. Dude, 
breaking furnitures of your neighbor's house won't repair your broken furnitures. 
So change your theory, and if you genuinely want to make yourself higher then 
work on yourself. </p>
<p>PS: Finally one confession, there was a time when I was a narcissist and 
bulldozer but I identified my problems and worked on myself. I saved so much 
energy in my day to day life which I previously invested for self-admiration and 
bulldozing others. I think we all have a little of these qualities and we all 
need to introspect ourselves. Imagine how much better place world would be if no 
one puts others down and no ones thinks that they are super special. </p>
