<p>It's hard to predict the future direction of sales, but it should include 
expanded growth for opportunity. Based on both my observations and talking with 
other successful salespeople, below are some predictions for the future 
direction of sales. </p>
<p><b>Pursuit of Sales Knowledge</b>--Salespeople will need to be 
	more knowledgeable about their industry, products, and 
	marketing techniques. Those who sell computers, phones, 
	cars and other feature-rich products may find it especially 
	challenging to master the complex data sheets, technical 
	bulletins and other information and effortlessly explain them 
	to customers. Consumers are more educated as to their 
	options, and salespeople must be able to demonstrate they 
	have the answers. Salespeople will have a better grasp of 
	demographics than their predecessors, studying buying 
	patterns, shifting populations and other topics. </p>
<p>In addition to reading the many available sales books and 
	attending their industry conferences, salespeople will share 
	information with each other via blogs and video 
	conferencing. At Gold Star, we frequently provide 
	salespeople with updates on industry changes and sales 
	techniques in a variety of ways and will continue looking for 
	more efficient ways of doing so. </p>
<p><b>Embracing Ethical Standards</b>--The mortgage industry 
	meltdown was a notable indicator of a lapse in overall 
	professionalism. Self-policing and government agency 
	monitoring will ensure that salespeople in mortgage lending 
	and most other fields will be held to higher standards than in 
	the past. As evident with the mortgage industry, there will be 
	a greater focus on licensing and registration so that 
	consumers can monitor a salesperson's reputation. 
	Salespeople will begin promoting their professional 
	designations to an even greater degree, thereby 
	distinguishing themselves from those who are not as 
	'qualified.' </p>
<p>In the future, salespeople will be extra vigilant in how they consult with

and recommend programs and services to their clients. They 
will be especially concerned that a particular product really 
is best for the client, rather than an expedient solution to 
complete a quick sale and/or to boost the salesperson's 
income.
