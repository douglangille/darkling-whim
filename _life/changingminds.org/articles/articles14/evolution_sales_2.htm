<p>Other than predicting that subprime loans would eventually create 
havoc with mortgage lending and the nation's economy, and to 
make regular forecasts for Gold Star's sales volume and related 
statistics, I have avoided making generalized conclusions about the 
future. Armchair prognosticating is a risky pastime; too many 
predictions are off the mark and even the wisest experts make major 
mistakes. However, I have become fascinated with the evolution of 
the sales profession and the varied changes that we can anticipate in 
the next 10-20 years. </p>
<p>Following are my observations, based on experience, 
discussions with other successful salespeople and, of course, some 
creative thinking. </p>
<p><b>Expanded Opportunities</b>--There definitely will be a wider 
	variety and a greater number of opportunities for 
	salespeople. An increase in products and services across all 
	industries will mean more sales career choices. Product 
	offerings will become even more refined as new product 
	development in auto manufacturing, consumer finance, 
	insurance, electronics and other industries becomes 
	increasingly sophisticated and aggressive in meeting 
	customer demands. </p>
<p><b>A Virtual Sales Force</b>--One of the most interesting 
	developments will be a more extensive use of the virtual 
	sales force. Various industries already have part- or full-time 
	salespeople working from 'home' offices, and this will be 
	even more prevalent in the near future. More companies will 
	see the wisdom of minimizing the 'brick and mortar' 
	expenses of adding new office space, and instead have 
	salespeople work from home offices networked to 
	headquarters, with all of the appropriate support. 
	As this book was being published (May 2011), Gold Star was 
	about to introduce its own Virtual Loan Officer Platform. Our 
	plans included adding a number of experienced loan officers 
	who would work from their own offices and receive the full 
	range of Gold Star's extensive support services. In addition to 
	eliminating the need to open a series of new offices in key 
	markets, we are taking advantage of the availability of many 
	veteran originators, including some who are semi-retired and 
	want to work on their own production schedule. The Virtual 
Sales Force concept will eventually be adopted by many 
other industries. </p>
<p>In the upcoming years many sales advancements will appear. Whether it be a 
virtual sales force working from home or greater sales opportunities, I am 
excited to see what the future holds for the sales industry. </p>
