<h1>What is a sales &#8216;thought leader&#8217;?</h1>

What is a sales &#8216;thought leader&#8217;?</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone called recently to ask if I were a &#8216;sales thought leader&#8217;. I laughed. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a trick question,&#8221; I replied. </p>
<p>The term &#8216;sales thought leader&#8217; is an oxymoron. As the person who developed a 
sales-related model to facilitate the behind-the-scenes aspects of the buyer&#8217;s 
decision path that can&#8217;t be addressed by the sales model (Buying Facilitation?), 
I&#8217;ve sought partners to think outside the box with me. Before he died, David 
Sandler called to buy me out, saying he thought he&#8217;d gone outside the box but 
hadn&#8217;t realized how far &#8216;outside the box&#8217; was until he read my then-latest book.
</p>
<p>So, in my map of the world, there has been nothing new in the field of sales 
since the Serpent convinced Eve to eat the apple. </p>
<h2>WHAT HAS CHANGED? </h2>
<p>The internet has made it easier to find prospects. But the field continues to 
push solutions at the wrong time and ignores the real influencing capability 
that&#8217;s possible far earlier in the buying path. The same-old same-old focus 
prevails, even in the face of decades, if not centuries, of inadequate results, 
rendering the term &#8216;sales thought leader&#8217; moot: </p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Appointments</b>: Most sales initiatives prospect by attempting to get an 
appointment, thereby eliminating a huge percentage of real prospects (appx 90% 
decline, many of whom could be buyers). Thought leaders would define prospects 
as those who WILL buy rather than who SHOULD, and begin conversations by 
immediately helping prospects navigate their decision/change journey and enlist 
the entire Buying Decision Team. The appointment will be requested by the Buying 
Decision Team and then they are ready to buy! </li>
	<li><b>Solution placement focus</b>: Throughout history, the sales model has assumed 
that where there is a &#8216;need&#8217; there&#8217;s a buyer &#8211; obviously a faulty assumption: 
The sales model closes approximately 7% of B2B sales regardless of the industry, 
or size/type of the solution or price. Can you think of any other profession 
that accedes to that level of failure? Doctors? Airplane safety? Imagine 
American Airlines advertizing that they have safe flights 8% of the time! Even a 
baseball player needs at least a 30% success rate! Entering with a solution 
placement focus &#8211; the end before the beginning! &#8211; ignores the idiosyncratic 
buying decision path that starts with an idea and demands appropriate buy in. A 
thought leader would start with a change management focus. </li>
	<li><b>Disregard of systems</b>: Buyers live in systems of rules, people, history, and a 
status quo that overrides &#8211; and must be included in &#8211; change. And a buying 
decision is a change management problem. When sellers attempt to &#8216;understand 
need&#8217; and find those who should buy, they are pushing change into a closed 
system and get the resistance (homeostasis) that all systems revert to when 
threatened. And don&#8217;t kid yourself: buyers don&#8217;t &#8216;need&#8217; you or they would have 
bought your solution already: they already have some sort of work-around that&#8217;s 
&#8216;good enough.&#8217; A thought leader would enter immediately as a part of the system, 
facilitate buy-in and the change management process, and discuss solutions only 
when everything was aligned, thereby avoiding resistance. </li>
	<li><b>Incentives, compensation packages</b>: By compensating for closed sales 
regardless of the number of good prospects lost, the inordinate amount of time 
to close, or the number of good clients lost that must be replaced, we 
perpetuate the numbers game. My clients, using Buying Facilitation?, close in 
1/2 the time. A thought leader would know how to close more sales in less time 
and make more money. </li>
</ul>
<h2>BUY-IN FIRST, SOLUTION LAST </h2>
<p>Until buyers manage the behind-the-scenes change issues and get buy-in from 
everyone who touches the final solution, they cannot buy. Yet we continue to 
seek appointments merely to explain how great we are (and &#8216;understand need&#8217;&#8230;so 
we can explain how great we are), and disregard their start-to-finish decision 
path, merely perpetuating failure. And wasting valuable seller&#8217;s time. </p>
<p>Sales thought leaders would have a different set of beliefs, skills, and 
outcomes: </p>
<ol>
	<li>focus on discovering and creating prospects who WILL buy, overlook those 
who can&#8217;t ever buy, and know the difference &#8211; on the first call; 
	</li>
	<li>on the first call, create and enter onto the Buying Decision Team and 
facilitate buy in issues (with the tech team, user groups, HR, or whomever 
touches the solution); </li>
	<li>discuss needs and solutions only when the Buying Decision Team buys in to 
change (and are made ready in ? the time by the seller); </li>
	<li>marketing automation and lead gen would lead buyers from an idea to 
solution choice. </li>
</ol>
<p>Currently sellers wait, and hope, for a sale to close, following prospects 
around for months and years without knowing which ones will close and going 
through hoops and time wastage to &#8216;close the sale&#8217;. Why? Because they sales 
doesn&#8217;t facilitate the private non-solution-related private decision issues 
along the decision path. So the only prospects who buy are those who show up 
having already achieved necessary buy in. And, unfortunately, the time it takes 
them to accomplish this is the length of the sales cycle. </p>
<p>But we can change this. A sales thought leader would have two sets of skills: 
one to manage change, and one to sell a solution. They would enter the 
conversation with: &#8220;How would you and your buying decision team know when it was 
time to add new banking services to the ones you&#8217;re using for those times your 
current bank couldn&#8217;t support you?&#8221; for example. And when the change 
management/buy in process is completed, their solution would fit in immediately 
(with no proposals or competition or objections) or not. </p>
<p>So I guess I&#8217;m a sales thought leader. But I sure wish there were others in 
the field to play with. Fighting the status quo has been a dark and lonely job 
for 25 years. Anyone want to join the leadership team with me? </p>
