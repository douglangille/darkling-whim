<h1>Is your company creative or innovative?</h1>

Is your company creative or innovative?</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Jim Rickard</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span LANG="EN">
<p>Perhaps you have heard the old story of the down on his luck friend who 
approached his successful friend and asked him for some help getting a job. He 
said to his friend, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember when we were roommates in college and I 
helped you study to pass that chemistry exam, and the times I lent you money for 
food because you ran short, and when I introduced you to your future wife, don&#8217;t 
your recall those events?&#8221; His friend replied, &#8220;Yes I do, but what have you done 
for me lately?&#8221;</p><p>
We smile at things like this but in the business world we cannot think that just 
because we had the latest and greatest innovative gizmo that our customers will 
be &#8220;Semper Fidelis&#8221; (Always Faithful) to our products if another company comes 
up with a new more attractive product. Xerox lost out to Canon when they 
introduced personal copiers, Kodak thought digital photography would never go 
anywhere; more people take pictures today with iPhones than any other type of 
camera. </p><p>
Success is fleeting and creativity and innovation are in short supply in the 
business world and if we begin as business leaders to slow down and rest on our 
past successes; then the footsteps we hear coming up from behind us will be the 
company who wants to win more than rest. Creativity and Innovation are not 
synonymous with each other although they are usually used together in 
conversation. Creativity is creating an idea or product, Innovation is about 
follow through and implementation of the idea or product. </p><p>
T.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) was creative and innovative when he led a 
group of &#8220;untrained and unruly&#8221; desert fighters against the highly trained and 
disciplined Turkish Army during the end of WWI. The fighters under Lawrence knew 
the desert and where to find water, they could travel 110 miles a day in the 
desert, with 100 rounds of ammunition and 45 pounds of flour. General Maurice de 
Saxe, an eighteenth century general, said &#8220;&#8230;the art of war was all about legs, 
not arms&#8230;&#8221; Lawrence and his group did not fight war according to the &#8220;rules&#8221; 
they intended to win at any cost by disrupting a superior army and keeping them 
off balance, and because of their creativity and innovation they were 
successful.</p><p>
Thomas Edison still holds the record for most patents at 1,093 and he looked at 
creativity as nothing more than &#8220;good, honest hard work.&#8221; He once said that 
&#8220;Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration.&#8221; </p><p>
A wise man I know once said, &#8220;Things like this don&#8217;t just happen, do something.&#8221; 
As a business leader or emerging leader your job for your organization is to 
&#8220;Make it happen.&#8221;</p><p>
Peter Drucker said it this way, &#8220;The best way to predict the future is to create 
it!&#8221;</p><p>
Wisdom literature tells us that &#8220;&#8230;there is no new thing under the sun.&#8221; Michael 
Michalko lists a mnemonic created by Bob Eberle called SCAMPER that states 
&#8220;&#8230;everything new is some addition or modification of something that already 
exists.&#8221; </p><p>
SCAMPER stands for:</p><p>
S=Substitute?</p><p>
C=Combine?</p><p>
A=Adapt?</p><p>
M=Magnify? Modify?</p><p>
P=Put to other uses?</p><p>
E=Eliminate?</p><p>
R=Rearrange? Reverse?</p><p>
Use the above mnemonic to ask the questions to yourself to generate creative 
ideas on your organization, a product or a problem. Can I substitute something 
for it? Can I combine it with something else? Can I magnify it or modify it? Can 
I&#8230;?</p><p>
Take a subject and change it into something else: petroleum jelly was a waste 
by-product of the petroleum industry until someone found another use for it and 
marketed it to the general public as a soothing ointment type of product for 
skin.</p><p>
Leaders have a great impact upon the design structure of the organization that 
they work within. There is usually a good reason why an organization has the 
structure that it has formed since its beginning; it is successful, it has 
always worked well in the past, and it has survived when other companies or 
organizations have failed. Organization comes from the Greek word &#8220;organon&#8221; 
meaning &#8220;a tool or an instrument.&#8221; </p><p>
If we think metaphorically of our organizations as tools, instruments or 
machines then those who work within them can begin to think, &#8220;I am just a cog in 
a machine&#8221;. When people begin to think in those terms, where every movement is 
choreographed into the corporate culture then motivation, innovation and 
creativity of workers cease and no one feels that they can make an independent 
decision. </p><p>
One way that leaders can help with instilling creativity and removing the 
barriers to creative development is to level the walls between departments 
within the organization by tasking people from different departments to work 
together on a common problem and the resolution of that problem. </p><p>
When this process is implemented on a regular basis and individuals from 
differing departments are selected or appointed to be on the group then 
cooperative relationships between departments are strengthened. People are more 
willing to help each other versus those types of organizations that work under a 
&#8220;skunk works&#8221; mindset (no department knows what the other one is working on) or 
the &#8220;silo&#8221; mentality where only the &#8220;command head&#8221; or the &#8220;boss&#8221; knows what is 
happening. </p><p>
This is a dangerous scenario for any organization to exist under due to the fact 
that if something happens to the knowledge base or the &#8220;brain trust&#8221; of the 
organization there will be no effective leadership in place. Cross-training is 
vital in any organization in order that more than one or two people know what is 
happening at any given time. </p><p>
Successful leaders know that by empowering employees and allowing independent 
thought and action on behalf of the organization that these actions will pay 
back positive dividends; over a workforce that has to ask permission from &#8220;the 
boss&#8221; for everything. </p><p>
Many successful companies now allow front-line employees the permission to 
resolve customer problems on the spot rather than going up through the 
management chain to find the right level of authority to make a decision. This 
does several things, it settles a claim or dispute at the local level and 
diffuses situations that could escalate through legal challenges, and ends the 
dispute in a positive manner that may encourage the continued patronage of a 
customer. </p><p>
The most valuable asset any company has is found in its employees who have a 
vested interest in the survival and growth of the organization. When they have 
authentic leadership who trusts them and empowers them within the company; then 
the trust factor is reciprocal and it is a win-win situation for all the 
stakeholders involved. </p><p>
We started this article with the question &#8220;Is your company creative or 
innovative?&#8221; </p><p>
You are the leader, &#8220;make a decision and make it happen!&#8221;</p>
