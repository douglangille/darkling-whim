The Evolution of Sales Part 6</p>

<p>It is a good time to enter the sales field due to the bright future the 
profession holds. While the future is difficult to predict, I believe that 
greater opportunities will arise. Below are some of my predictions for the next 
10-20 years in the sales industry. </p>
<p><b>Become a Specialist</b>--While there will still be room for the 
generalists--someone selling an entire product line--more 
industries will rely on specialists. With the increase in 
products and services, companies will want their salespeople 
to handle a specific product or two. I think it will become 
increasingly difficult to be a 'jack of all trades.' This should 
be more pronounced in service areas such as insurance and 
financial planning. </p>
<p><b>Welcoming an Enhanced Image</b>--Consumers will have a 
much higher regard for the sales profession. This will only 
occur as more standards are developed and as salespeople 
become more professional and better educated. The United 
Professional Sales Association has created a Professional 
Sales Ethics Framework, including an ethical Code of 
Conduct and a Buyer's Bill of Rights. In addition to following 
ethical practices, salespeople will contribute to the improved 
image by demonstrating their knowledge and customer- 
centric behavior. It takes time for multiple industries to adopt 
new guidelines and for salespeople to adhere to them on a 
regular basis, but the buying public will gradually notice the 
difference, especially as trade associations and individual 
companies promote their emphasis on professionalism in 
advertising, Website announcements, magazine articles and 
other forums. Consumers and others will have a greater 
respect for the salespeople they encounter in retail stores, 
offices and online outlets. </p>
<p>We will have to wait a while to see how much of my 
amateur forecasting is accurate. However, I am confident 
that our profession will be more rewarding on many fronts, 
and an even greater number of people will share my passion 
for sales. </p>
