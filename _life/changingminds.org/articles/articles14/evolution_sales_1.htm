The Evolution of Sales Part 1</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Daniel Milstein</i></p>

<p>It is hard to believe that not so long ago, most salespeople 
actually took all customer applications by hand, or that 
consumers could only buy books, shoes and computers at retail 
outlets. So much has changed in the sales profession, and there is so 
much to look forward to that I envy salespeople of the future. They 
will be better trained, have amazing opportunities and enjoy more 
respect than their predecessors. </p>
<p>I have a good understanding of the future of Gold Star, but 
am also interested in the future of the sales profession and, more 
specifically, the challenges and opportunities that await salespeople 
in different fields. For newer salespeople and those who haven't yet 
started their sales careers, these potential developments should be of 
special interest. </p>
<p>The sales function has substantially evolved during the last 50+ 
years, since pioneering salespeople began 'peddling' cash registers, 
encyclopedias, cars and a myriad of other products. Early 
salespeople often carried bulky sample cases door-to-door. Now it's 
the age of the Internet marketplace. </p>
<p>The dramatic changes to the sales profession have greatly 
affected the way we conduct business. For example, as late as 1998 
loan officers took handwritten applications, careful not to make a 
mistake because 'white out' or correction tape was not allowed (to 
avoid the appearance of fraud). The automated approval process 
hadn't been developed. Overworked appraisers would prepare their 
handwritten reports and attach a Polaroid photo, hoping that one 
day electronic submissions would make their jobs easier. It typically 
took an agonizingly slow 90 days to close a loan. Taking 
applications on an office computer, a laptop or more recently an 
iPad has significantly streamlined the loan process. A borrower with 
good credit can have their loan closed in 15 days, even in today's 
stricter lending environment. </p>
<p>Salespeople in other professions have experienced similar 
changes. Whereas earlier it was necessary to conduct most business 
face-to-face, e-mail has offered a faster way to initiate contact and 
provide status reports. A proliferation of software programs has 
enhanced much of the salesperson's daily routine, from the initial 
application process to database management. 
Online sales have increased in diverse product categories. 
Dell Computers was one of the first companies to embrace Internet 
commerce; eventually followed by Amazon.com, Zappos.com and 
numerous others. Much of the change in the way people buy is 
dictated by shifting demographics; the younger generation is more 
comfortable with Internet stores, preferring to make many purchases 
from their favorite Websites. </p>
<p>There may be a few long-time salespeople who prefer the pre-Internet era, but 
I have yet to meet any of them. Each year more and more technological 
advancements expand the opportunities of sales professionals. </p>
