Think and Reach 'Outside the Box'</p>

<p>The most successful salespeople don't follow guidelines strictly by the book; 
you must be able to think &quot;outside the box&quot; and be innovative in your 
techniques. </p>
<p>Top producers constantly seek unique ways to run their business. It 
may involve implementing new operational or marketing techniques 
to set them apart from the competition. Offering discounted pricing, 
developing a professional athlete niche and introducing a special $1 
million giveaway promotion were a few of the different approaches 
we took to generate recognition of Gold Star. When Gold Star held a 
company-wide managers' meeting, we decided to host a giant 
tailgate party at a University of Michigan football game. This was 
more than a welcome gathering for our employees; we wanted to 
reach a larger audience--many of the 115,000 spectators who were 
at the newly remodeled stadium that day. We had a giant Gold Star 
banner and posters made, showcasing our 800-201-LOAN number 
and our reputation as one of the area's best places to work. We 
knew that a huge audience of potential customers and employees 
would see the display. It was well worth our time and investment, as 
we substantially increased our visibility and had a great time doing 
so. </p>
<p>Thinking outside the box doesn't necessarily require an 
excessive budget. When I started as a salesman, I developed an 
emerging market (immigrant) niche that no one else was exploring at 
the time. Find your own niche. Research the demographics of your 
area. Look at the trends of where the population has been and how 
experts believe it will evolve. If you see that the 65+ population is 
on the rise, offer programs appealing to that group. </p>
<p>I also placed an emphasis on providing Realtors with 
referrals before ever asking them for leads, another seemingly basic 
strategy that my competitors had not adopted. You can start your 
own celebrity niche on a local scale, by doing business with radio 
and television station personalities and other well-known people. </p>
<p>Overall, you need to take a more creative approach to your 
usual routine. Evaluate what you have done in the past and what the 
competition is doing, then make sure you continually test a few new 
strategies. If you do this, you are on track to become a successful salesperson.
