The Importance of Brainstorming</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brainstorming is essential in building a start-up business. When Gold Star 
began, brainstorming meetings as a team turned our ideas into plans which were 
then implemented. </p>
<p>Initially, we held most of our employee meetings at a nearby 
restaurant-pub rather than a formal office conference room. This 
seemed perfectly natural at the time, offering an ideal opportunity to 
brainstorm ideas and implement them on the turn of a dime, while 
enjoying refreshments and camaraderie in an informal atmosphere. 
For example, a few of the hot topics considered during these night 
weekly conferences: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Hiring practices</li>
	<li>Complex transactions/troubleshooting difficult loans</li>
	<li>New marketing strategies</li>
	<li>The challenges of growing a young business</li>
	<li>The challenges of our major league sports teams </li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, some ideas never made it off the drawing board or 
cocktail napkin; however the open forum enabled all employees to 
voice their opinions, which we would then consider and make the 
appropriate management decisions. The value of these brain trust 
planning sessions is that we got objective viewpoints and 
occasionally great ideas that we could then run with. In these 
informal meetings, nothing was out of bounds; they were a safe 
place for free flowing ideas - and even a few laughs. </p>
<p>It is important to keep a team atmosphere where ideas are allowed to flow 
freely with no judgement. The outcome of a brainstorming session will not only 
open communication but will provide inspired ideas to develop.</p>
