<p>With technological advancements and industry growth, the future looks bright 
for the sale profession. In coming years, sales people will need to rely on a 
couple of guidelines to remain relevant. </p>
<p><b>Keeping it Personal</b>--There will still be a need for 
salespeople to make a connection with customers, to match 
a face with the voice. The Internet has minimized the 
amount of 'face time' required to excel in sales, but it has 
not eliminated the importance of maintaining personal 
relationships. I have purchased several cars without actually 
visiting the dealership, after viewing their 'online 
showroom' and subsequently arranging the vehicle's 
delivery to my home. However, I had already developed a 
good rapport with the sales manager and was confident that 
it was the best possible deal. </p>
<p>Salespeople will find it necessary to query customers and 
prospects on the way they wish to meet and stay in contact. 
It will most likely be a combination of in-person meetings, e- 
mail, online discussions on Skype and other venues. 
</p>
<p><b>Teams to Help Expand</b>--In some industries there will be 
more emphasis on team selling, the development of mutually 
beneficial alliances. Loan originators have done this 
successfully for years, with one or more 'junior' salespeople 
supporting the lead loan officer's production. I believe that 
there will be more informal partnerships of salespeople 
working together as teams, for increased efficiencies and to 
ensure the customer's needs are met. For example, this might 
involve a financial planner, Realtor, CPA, loan originator and 
insurance advisor serving as the customer's financial services 
team. </p>
<p>On the other hand, it is likely that fewer sales assistants will 
be needed, because greater online options will help 
streamline a company's operations. As more consumers 
apply for a mortgage or purchase a car on a website, there 
will be a reduction in the necessary administrative support. 
When an innovative company developed an online 
application program enabling borrowers to do most of the 
work in seeking a mortgage--selecting the loan based on 
established criteria, filling in required title information and 
completing the closing documentation--it set the stage for 
other industries to follow suit. There will be many such 
examples of less support staff being needed to help complete 
a sale. </p>
<p>The future salesperson will be better educated, knowledgeable, more 
professional and technology savvy than earlier salespeople. They will have 
better training in their specific industry and access to a greater array of 
resources. </p>
