The Evolution of Sales Part 3</p>

<p>In recent years, sales opportunities have expanded tremendously and will only 
continue to grow. In the future, sales will evolve to include: </p>
<p><b>Better Educated Salespeople</b>--We will see an even greater 
	emphasis on education to prepare people for a sales career. 
	There will still be on-the-job training, but it will be much 
	more formal and comprehensive as companies upgrade their 
	trainee and mentoring programs to match their competitors' 
	advanced curricula. </p>
<p>In addition, more colleges and universities will create 
	professional selling programs, such as the one developed by 
	Baylor University. I envision more high level internships, 
	enabling students to gain valuable experience at top flight 
	companies. There will also be more continuing education 
	requirements to keep pace with industry developments and 
	diverse options to meet them. </p>
<p>Ideally, more successful salespeople will add their expertise 
	as classroom instructors, partially dispelling the tired phrase 
	'Those who can't do, teach.' </p>
<p><b>Technology to Advance, Streamline</b>--Technological 
	advancements will continue at near warp speed and have a 
	major impact on the sales function. In addition to the virtual 
	sales force, we will see technology take an even more critical 
	role in the way we develop leads, interact with customers, 
	process and close the sale, and establish brand awareness on 
	a more global basis. </p>
<p>While I hesitate to pinpoint specific tech advancements, I am 
intrigued about the potential that tablet computers will have 
in expanding business with customers and strategic partners. 
In addition, Facebook pages, personal Websites, smart phone 
applications and Twitter accounts may be surpassed as the 
most effective tools for salespeople. </p>
<p>Salespeople of the future will be more attuned to 
technological applications generally and within their specific 
profession.The most successful salespeople will be computer and tech 
savvy and work with IT consultants to ensure that they are on 
the cutting edge of sales-related technology. </p>
