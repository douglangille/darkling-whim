Social Studies 101: Get schooled on getting help with social media</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Lisa Peyton</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Getting schooled on getting help with social mediaMy company recently 
conducted a survey and there was one stat that really stood out. A whopping 94% 
of businesses surveyed felt that adding social media to the marketing mix would 
help meet overall business objectives. That was expected since social media has 
become THE marketing buzz word over the last few years. The shocking part was 
that 68% of those businesses neglected to allocate resources to social media. So 
many businesses completely get the value of social media, but haven&#8217;t made the 
move to put their money where their mouths are. </p>
<p>This article is for those who recognize the value of social media but due to 
lack of time, knowledge or fear have refused to step-up and commit to 
implementing a social media campaign. </p>
<p>If you consider yourself to be a social media &#8216;expert,&#8217; then stop reading 
immediately. This article ISN&#8217;T for you. I&#8217;ll be covering topics including: 
defining social media needs, allocating resources, researching possible 
solutions, and what to ask once a solution has been sourced. Experts may want to 
scroll down and take a look at my list of questions to ask potential social 
media service providers. It certainly couldn&#8217;t hurt to start working on a good 
answer. ;-) </p>
<h2>What do you REALLY need? </h2>
<p>The first step is take a moment to reflect on what it is you feel you want 
from social media. Carefully outline the business objectives you are hoping to 
meet by implementing a social media campaign and be prepared to share these 
insights with any social media professionals you contact. </p>
<p>Once you feel satisfied with your campaign goals, it&#8217;s time to examine what 
part of the social media campaign you&#8217;ll need some help with. Based upon your 
own knowledge and availability and any other internal resources, decide what 
role you would like to play in your company&#8217;s social media. I would suggest that 
the most successful campaigns involve a close collaboration with the primary 
stakeholders and any outside consultant or agency. Below are some typical social 
media campaign components. Pinpointing which areas you&#8217;ll need help with can 
help you source the best solution. </p>
<p><b>Overall strategy and messaging</b> &#8211; This would entail exploring which message 
would be most effective and via which platform. It could include consultations 
covering how to provide value to your on-line community and research to find 
where your on-line community spends it&#8217;s time. If your strength includes 
researching and implementing compelling promotions, then you may not need as 
much help in this area. On the other hand, if you&#8217;re a small business who hasn&#8217;t 
committed any resources to an on-line presence or other marketing initiatives, 
you may need quite a bit of help in this category. </p>
<p><b>Implementation and development</b> &#8211; Once you know how to effectively reach and 
influence your community, it&#8217;s time to implement. This would include the actual 
development of a social media property such as a Facebook page, a company blog, 
Twitter account, etc. If you already have a team of web designer and development 
rock stars, they may be able to take care of some of the basics on this one &#8211; 
like installing a WordPress blog and creating a custom background for Twitter. 
You&#8217;ll also need a great copywriter to provide written information about your 
business within each of these properties. If you&#8217;re just not technically savvy 
and really don&#8217;t spend much time on social media outlets, then I would highly 
recommend getting some help with this one. </p>
<p><b>Ongoing content creation and management</b> &#8211; After the social media channels 
have been built, someone will need to create content and dialogue with your 
community. Blog posts will need to be written, Facebook updates will need to be 
made and conversations will require ongoing nurturing. In my opinion, this is 
one of THE MOST neglected areas of social media development. If you build a 
blog, they will NOT come. It will take hours of work to initiate a valuable 
conversation with your potential audience. It&#8217;s very important to allocate 
enough resources to this, whether it be internal or outsourced. </p>
<p><b>Tracking campaign results and demonstrating ROI</b> &#8211; So how do you know if all 
this hard work is paying off? By setting up and tracking measureable goals that 
mesh with your overall business objectives. Remember those goals you set up at 
the start of this journey? This is where a few hours invested in a consultant 
can REALLY pay dividends. There are many great tracking solutions out there, 
several for under $100 bucks 
(http://socialfresh.com/social-media-monitoring-big-brand-bang-for-under-100-bucks/). 
If you feel overwhelmed with all the data that will be available to you, a good 
consultant can help you focus on the juicy, actionable stuff that will help 
inform future campaign decisions. </p>
<h2>How much are you willing to pay for it? </h2>
<p>As you can see, there&#8217;s quite a bit of work that goes into properly planning 
for and implementing social media campaigns. So it&#8217;s time to get real with 
yourself and commit, commit, commit! If you recognize you need help with all the 
areas above, you&#8217;ll also need to acknowledge it will require some funding. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re thinking &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s why I haven&#8217;t moved forward with social 
media. I can&#8217;t afford it,&#8221; I would argue that you can&#8217;t afford to wait. Examine 
where you are currently allocating marketing dollars and do a bit of juggling. 
If you&#8217;ve already invested in print media, TV, Radio, or directory listings, ask 
yourself &#8216;What have they done for me lately?&#8217; If you can PROVE they are meeting 
your marketing goals with hard data; great. More likely you have no real idea if 
they are helping to meet those objectives or not. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a smaller business that doesn&#8217;t have a marketing budget, then 
you&#8217;ll need to be ready to take on this work internally. You can&#8217;t expect to get 
help in all the areas above on a shoe-string budget. You CAN invest in a few 
hours of consultation to get you pointed in the right direction and then utilize 
on-line resources and your own staff power to begin the conversation. Remember 
your goals need to be aligned with your available resources. </p>
<h2>Social Solution </h2>
<p>Now that I&#8217;ve delivered the lecture on aligning goals with budget, it&#8217;s time 
to source a solution. There are a few different options when considering paying 
for help. </p>
<p><b>Full-service agency</b> &#8211; There are several types of agencies that can help a 
business with social media. Public Relations agencies, Advertising firms, Search 
Engine Optimization agencies, Interactive Media agencies and agencies completely 
devoted to social media. </p>
<p><b>Consultant</b> &#8211; There&#8217;s no shortage of social media &#8216;experts&#8217; willing to have 
you pay them for their advice. Their services can range from a few hours of 
initial consulting to working with you as a member of your marketing team. </p>
<p><b>Full-time hire</b> &#8211; There&#8217;s also no shortage of social media professionals 
looking for a full-time job. Considering the ailing job market and if you 
currently have the funds to consider bringing someone on full-time to handle the 
job, it might prove a good value. </p>
<p><b>Training programs</b> &#8211; There are many social media programs, certificates, and 
workshops available both online and off. Investing in this type of training for 
yourself or an employee may be a solution to consider. </p>
<p><b>Free online resources</b> &#8211; There&#8217;s a bevy of free online resources out there. 
If you don&#8217;t have ANY budget to speak of, you can always invest your time. A 
great start is creating your own personal profiles as a way to learn about the 
medium and slowly incorporating your business objectives. </p>
<h2>The Steps </h2>
<p>So now that we&#8217;ve explored what you may need and the solutions out there 
available to you, here&#8217;s how I would conduct the search. </p>
<h3>1) Use Your Network </h3>
<p>Start with your immediate connections and ask for a referral. Chance are 
someone within your circle has worked with someone in social media in the past 
and can offer up a recommendation. If no referrals are forthcoming, expand your 
search to your social media networks. Twitter is an amazing tool for getting 
connected with talented professionals. </p>
<h3>2) Expanding Your Search </h3>
<p>There are quite a few online directories filled with social media 
professionals, including the recent launch of investinsocial.com 
(http://www.investinsocial.com). They can be a great resource for getting a 
broad look at many service providers in one place and categorized into 
user-friendly buckets. </p>
<p>Online publications and blogs can also be a great resource for finding help. 
Most social media pros publish their own blog or write for publications such as 
Socialfresh.com. If you&#8217;re interested in some local help, then search for local, 
online publications that feature local talent. </p>
<p>Only as a last resort would I recommend good old Google. Using Google alone 
to make your social media service provider decisions could prove lethal. There 
are quite a few companies out there that pretend to do social media but don&#8217;t 
really deliver. There&#8217;s a great article by Tom Martin outlining this issue: Is 
your social media agency faking it? (http://socialfresh.com/is-your-social-media-agency-faking-it/). 
I DO recommend &#8216;googling&#8217; any referrals in order to check-out their online 
presence. Visit their blog, Facebook page, and Twitter profile to get an idea of 
how they deal with marketing their own brand. I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily be looking 
for daily updates: many great shops are SO busy managing their clients campaigns 
that they don&#8217;t have the resources to spend tons of time on their own social 
media stuff. </p>
<h3>3) Ask, Ask, Ask </h3>
<p>Once you have sourced a few options, you need to ask questions. Here are some 
good ones to get you started. Not all of these may be appropriate for your 
situation, but you can adjust as needed. </p>
<ul>
	<li>Who will be managing my account?</li>
	<li>Will you be implementing recommendations or will I?</li>
	<li>What tracking tools do you use?</li>
	<li>Which metrics do you actively track and report on?</li>
	<li>Once the engagement has ended how will the transition process work?</li>
	<li>Which accounts will I have access to and which will I own upon contract 
completion?</li>
	<li>Can you provide writing samples from any content creators working on my account?</li>
	<li>How will I be updated regarding my campaigns progress? Weekly call? Email? 
Monthly report?</li>
	<li>How will you recruit new followers and fans? </li>
</ul>
<h3>4) Be Patient </h3>
<p>Growing an online community takes time. I wouldn&#8217;t trust anyone that promises 
to grow your fan base significantly in just a few short weeks. Chances are 
they&#8217;re using questionable techniques that may or MAY NOT yield fans interested 
in you or your product. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
