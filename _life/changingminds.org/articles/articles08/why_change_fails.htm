<h1>Reasons Why Change Fails</h1>

Reasons Why Change Fails</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Richard Derwent Cooke</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="quote">
<i>Richard Cooke, director of I-Change argues that Change as a process never 
fails because things always change. It is more accurate to say that we fail to 
get the results we wanted, or needed or anticipated. Change is a subtle, natural 
force and it can&#8217;t be turned on and off, it has to be harnessed. If we think 
about how sailors use the wind and tides, or how farmers use rivers to irrigate 
their fields we have a better idea of the required attitude.</i></p>
<p>
Change happens when align ourselves with natural forces any system. feed things grow; grow where there space (opportunities), light (attention) nourishment. King Canute commanded waves retreat he was held up ridicule, but manager commands &#8220;Change&#8221;, seem think this reasonable.</p>
<p>
People will only do what they believe is in their interests to do. Let&#8217;s 
deconstruct that sentence, and look at some of the key words. <b>They</b><i> </i>have to 
<b>believe </b>it is in <b>their </b>interests. If we fail to cover all three of these bases, 
then they won&#8217;t &#8216;play&#8217;. So, taking those elements one at a time:- 
</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>They</b>: it is what the staff think and feel that is crucial. The opinion of 
the company or the manager is only important to the degree that they hold 
influence / power over the individual. The greater the respect, trust or 
relationship that you have, then the more they will listen to you. However, 
<u>never</u> shortcut the step of explaining why this is something they need to do.</li>
  <li><b>Believe</b>: This is a bit like a game of Monopoly, you can not move out of Jail 
until you have thrown a double. Nor can you begin your change programme till you 
have won people over. It maybe you need to start on something simpler or smaller 
first to gain their confidence.</li>
  <li><b>Their</b>: everybody needs to know <i>What Is in it For Me</i>. We have been programmed 
by the forces of Nature and Evolution to survive, and each time we are asked to 
do something, some primitive part of our brain checks to see it helps our 
survival. If it <u>feels</u> too dangerous then we won&#8217;t do it. If the environment is 
one where we are not allow to make our feelings known we will say <i>&#8220;Yes boss&#8221;</i>, 
and ignore it in every way we can. It should be pointed out that management use 
this tactic all the time, but it is called <i>&#8216;political savvy&#8217; </i>when they do it 
rather than <i>&#8216;resistance&#8217;</i>. </li>
</ol>
<p>The other day someone asked the question <i>&#8220;How do I reward and recognise a 
team, I know that &#8216;more money&#8217; isn&#8217;t the answer&#8221; </i>and I told them that the key 
wasn&#8217;t M&amp;S vouchers, flowers or days go-carting, rather is had to come from 
genuine, unconditional appreciation of them and their efforts. Most people are 
part of a pack and they need a leader who inspires them and makes them feel 
safe. The safest member of the pack is the most valuable one. These are very 
powerful and very ancient drives, and not to be ignored. We all long for the 
approval of <i>&#8216;parent&#8217;</i> figures in our world and bosses fall into that category. 
However, just saying <i>&#8220;Well done&#8221; </i>really doesn&#8217;t do it. You have to actually 
<u>mean</u> 
it, people can tell the difference. You need to show that you have seen the 
real them and appreciated their unique contribution. </p><p>
It is a cliché to say that everyone is unique but it is true, and deep within 
us, we know this and we long for people to see, recognise and appreciate our 
unique gifts. Doing this makes us feel special, and this is a very heady &#8216;drug&#8217; 
and we will go a very long way for more of it. However, I repeat, for it to 
work, it has to be <u>real</u>. </p><p>
So to answer some more questions that I was asked <i>&#8220;Why is it so hard to get 
Change management right?&#8221;</i> Because it is a very human process and requires 
sensitivities and skills that the modern workplace tends not to value or 
nurture. There are few courses on sensitivity: communication courses deal with 
slide decks rather than telling your truth.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p>
<h3>What are organisations doing wrong?</h3><p>
They adopt an engineer&#8217;s view of their business rather than say, a mothers. An 
engineer is looking for a switch he can throw to make things happen the same way 
every time. A mother just wants the best for her children and wants them to grow 
safe and happy. An engineer uses resources; a mother nurtures people. The phrase 
Human Resources its self tells you all you need to know&#8230;</p><h3>
What can HR do to ensure change is a success? </h3><p>
Apart from all that is implicit in the previous paragraph, they have to become 
the part of the company that looks after people rather than processes them and 
their records. I was an accountant for 25 years, and I always thought that there 
was little difference between the accounts department and the HR one, apart from 
the things they counted. Managers are there to get the job done, but they are 
subject to all sorts of stresses and pressures, HR should be there to catch 
people when their managers can&#8217;t see what is required. They should bring 
objectivity to the care process. They do have the time, they should have the 
skills. However, as long as their prime role is &#8216;Hire&#8217;em &#8216;n&#8217; Fire &#8216;em&#8217; then they 
will not be trusted and immediately become part of the problem for the staff.</p><p>
By recognising Change as part of Nature rather than an industrial process we are 
much more likely to approach it with the care and sensitivities we need to make 
it successful. If you still aren&#8217;t convinced, then think back to some of the 
really good teachers either you or your children had&#8230; what were they like? They 
weren&#8217;t all about processes, flow charts, slide decks and emails were they? They 
listened, they got down to your level, they excited and encouraged you, and, 
when necessary, they picked you up, brushed you off and told you <i>&#8220;Never mind.. 
it&#8217;ll be all right next time.&#8221;</i> </p><p>
Many mangers feel that they have to check &#8216;the real them&#8217; at the office door and 
only pick up the mantle again once they get home to their kids. However, if they 
dared tried using some of these softer skills, awareness and intuitions to bring 
along their staff with them they would be vastly more successful. Business might 
need a hard-nose, but it also requires a soft-heart to make Change happen. A 
successful change leader knows which organ to use and when.</p>
