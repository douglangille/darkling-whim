Engagement Metrics </h1>

Engagement Metrics </p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Dr. John L. Schinnerer and Shirley Knight</i></p>
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="quote"><i>On average, companies change CMOs every two years. Is this a function of 
unrealistic expectations, unclear job requirements, or something more 
fundamental? Perhaps the solution is as simple as accurately measuring that 
which truly bonds consumers to brands &#8211; emotional engagement. </i> </p>
<p>The task of linking consumer behavior to brands and marketing efforts is a 
difficult one with which the best Chief Marketing Officers&#8217; grapple daily. 
Solutions such as self-report surveys, focus groups, and in-depth interviews 
suffer from a critical disconnect between their results and consumers&#8217; real 
world behavior. This ongoing challenge has put Chief Marketing Officers (CMOs) 
into the unenviable position where their best efforts are not measureable, and 
as a result their job security is never assured. </p>
<h2>The CMO&#8217;s Dilemma </h2>
<p>In his Gallup Management Journal article &#8220;The Chief Marketing Officer&#8217;s 
Dilemma,&#8221; Willam J. McEwen looks at some of the difficulties of the CMO position 
&#8211; rapid turnover, high pressure expectations, and a poorly defined job. The CMO 
position faces inherent difficulties in the sense that customer engagement 
depends upon<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Communicating the brand promise and </p><p>
b) Delivering upon the company&#8217;s brand promise. <br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both consumer engagement and profitability rise when employees help deliver 
on the brand promise. The difficulty arises in that the CMO has control over the 
first half of the equation (communicating brand promise via advertising and 
marketing) but not the second half (delivering upon brand promise via employees 
and operations). </p>
<p>The CMO has no direct control over the workforce. They control 
the packaging, promotion and promise, but not the daily deliverance and 
implementation. Thus, to a large extent, the real potential, and the potential 
pitfalls, of the brand are in the hands of employees who are outside of the 
CMO&#8217;s control. </p>
<h2>Gallup&#8217;s Proposed Solution </h2>
<p>The solution to the dilemma is two pronged. First, CMOs must be capable of 
recognizing and understanding the entire breadth of their brand &#8211; from the 
brand&#8217;s promise to each interaction between employee and customer to every 
experience customers have with the brand. This indicates that CMOs must &#8220;look at 
the world from the customer&#8217;s point of view.&#8221; Second, senior executives must 
design more comprehensive, well-defined objectives and accountability measures 
for their CMOs. However, this solution proposed by Mr. McEwen falls short of the 
target. </p>
<p>The assessment of the problem and its respective solutions can be 
extended to incorporate a broader view of the mind, the market, the brand and 
the CMO &#8211; a view which involves both sides of the mind, the rational and the 
emotional, and allows for a more accurate picture of engagement, branding and 
profitability </p>
<h2>Rational vs. Emotional Mind </h2>
<p>From a neuromarketing perspective, there are at least two parts to the human 
mind &#8211; the rational and the emotional. </p>
<p>The <i>rational mind</i> is reasonable, logical, and linear. The rational mind is 
excellent at developing levelheaded explanations for behavior. It is so good it 
has consumers (and others) convinced that they are rational shoppers. The 
rational mind is so good at creating the illusion that it is in control that 
scientists didn&#8217;t even discover the emotional mind until a few decades ago. In 
other words, the rational mind has conveniently overlooked the existence of the 
emotional mind ever since Descartes&#8217; famous but flawed line, &#8220;I think, therefore 
I am.&#8221; </p>
<p>The <i>emotional mind</i> is associative, largely subconscious, irrational and 
intense. The emotional mind is more powerful than the rational mind. It had 
greater endurance than the rational mind. It works more quickly than the 
rational mind. This is partially due to the order in which the brain evolved 
over millions of years. </p>
<p>Those areas of the brain which are primarily responsible 
for emotions, the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the insula, among other 
regions, developed 5 &#8211; 10 million years ago. On the other hand, the part of the 
brain responsible for rational thought, the neocortex, developed a mere 40,000 &#8211; 
2 million years ago. In terms of evolutionary brain development, the rational 
mind is still in its infancy, while the emotional mind is like a mature adult. 
So the emotional mind has been through hundreds of revisions and updates, while 
the rational mind is still a bit &#8216;buggy.&#8217; </p>
<p>Research confirms the emotional mind 
is a more powerful driver of behavior. Consumers buy with the emotional mind and 
explain the purchase (to their spouse, for instance) with rational mind. </p>
<h2>The Importance of Fully Engaged Customers </h2>
<p>Gallup has shown that &#8220;profitable growth is directly dependent on the degree 
to which a company&#8217;s customers are &#8216;fully engaged.&#8217;&#8221; Gallup defines &#8220;fully 
engaged customers&#8221; as &#8220;strongly emotionally attached and attitudinally loyal.&#8221; 
On the other hand, actively disengaged customers are &#8220;completely detached from 
your company&#8230;they may become virulently antagonistic toward your company or 
brand&#8230;they&#8217;re always eager to tell others exactly how they feel.&#8221; </p>
<p>The inevitability of negative customer-employee interactions and subsequent 
drops in customer engagement make it imperative that the CMO find a way to 
accurately quantify and measure emotional engagement. With an accurate method to 
lay out the conscious and subconscious emotions that consumers feel when they 
interact with the brand, the CMO has a fighting chance to ensure customers 
return again and again for the same &#8220;feel good&#8221; experience. 
</p>
<p>Once the CMO has 
this emotional profile for the brand, then she can set about focusing on 
&#8220;increasing sales share &#8230;while meaningfully enhancing the brand.&#8221; Until then, 
the CMO is akin to a ship atop the sea without a rudder; adrift without a map.
</p>
<h2>Emotions and the Subconscious Drive Behavior </h2>
<p>Emotions and the subconscious are the primary driving forces behind consumer 
behavior, including buying behavior. The challenge has been to develop a tool to 
accurately identify and measure conscious and subconscious emotions in real 
time. In the absence of any such tool, CMO&#8217;s have had to rely on basic, 
rudimentary methods, such as observation of shopping behavior, self-report 
questionnaires and focus groups to predict engagement and behavior. These 
methods have proven inconclusive at best. </p>
<p>The CMO&#8217;s job security is thus tied to 
shaky and unreliable data collection methods. Given how consumer data is still 
being collected in archaic ways, it&#8217;s no wonder that the tenure in the CMO 
position is so short. The problem is not that the CMO does or does not know how 
to do the job. The problem is that no one knows how to accurately measure 
emotional engagement so there are no real benchmarks against which performance 
can be judged. </p>
<h2>Communicating Brand Promise </h2>
<p>The creator of the most successful mass-communication ad campaigns for Avis 
and Volkswagen, William Bernbach, said, &#8220;You can say the right thing about a 
product, and nobody will listen. You&#8217;ve got to say it in such a way that people 
will feel it in their gut. Because if they don&#8217;t feel it, nothing will happen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The value of brand equity is not so much in the rational, conscious mind as 
it is in the emotional, subconscious mind. It&#8217;s not how consumers think about a 
company or its offerings. It&#8217;s how they feel about it. And oftentimes, they&#8217;re 
not even consciously aware of how they feel. The most successful marketing 
campaigns will speak to the head and the heart, the rational and the emotional. 
Yet, for most CMOs, the ability to accurately measure the emotional side of the 
equation is not an option, if, for no other reason, than no adequate emotional 
ruler exists. </p>
<p>The one company which has best delivered on the promise of measuring 
emotional engagement is the aptly named, Emotion Mining Company. Emotion Mining 
Company has developed an online, projective technique which enables accurate and 
reliable measurement of the emotional mind. This information is as essential as 
it is unprecedented and as such it makes sense that Emotion Mining&#8217;s tool be 
standard for every company that wants to reach consumers at a gut level. </p>
<h2>Delivering On Brand Promise </h2>
<p>The second part of the CMO&#8217;s dilemma, delivering upon the brand&#8217;s promise, 
also has an essential emotional component to it. This should come as no surprise 
as we are still dealing with humans who are quintessentially emotional beings. 
It is well understood that employee satisfaction is positively linked to 
profitability. The more engaged employees are, the better their interactions 
with customers; the better the interactions with customers, the more loyalty 
generated; and customer loyalty equals profit. </p>
<p>To truly leverage employee engagement, find out how employees really feel 
about the customer base in general. If a call center representative thinks of 
and, more importantly, feels that customers are like incapable, annoying 
children, their interactions will obviously suffer. If a call center rep sees 
the customers as sources of innovative ideas who are in genuine need of help, 
their interactions will flourish and the brand will gain new champions as a 
result of their positive exchanges. </p>
<p>Even though delivery of the brand promise is outside the CMO&#8217;s purview, she 
can still influence her colleagues who oversee delivery by acquiring and sharing 
a deeper, more accurate, understanding of a) how the consumer perceives the 
brand and b) how the consumer wants to experience the brand. In this way, the 
CMO provides the company with the necessary hard data to create the finest 
possible customer experience. Such information in the hands of senior management 
would be a powerful driver of organizational change and brand enhancement as it 
creates positive guidelines for promotion and delivery. </p>
<p>Measuring the emotional responses of consumers is an aspect of market 
research that is just now coming to the fore, creating new and necessary tools 
for the marketing toolbox. Dr. Tom Snyder, the founder of Emotion Mining Company 
Inc., whose method identifies conscious and subconscious emotional reactions to 
a question, brand or concept, states, &#8220;The emotion data &#8211; both quantitative and 
qualitative &#8211; is generated in less than a month and provides previously 
unavailable insights into the consumer&#8217;s perspective. As a result our clients, 
such as Coca-Cola, have been able to better target both marketing and delivery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As McEwen suggested in his article, CMOs need to look at the world from their 
customer&#8217;s point of view, and senior management need to design more 
comprehensive, well-defined objectives and accountability measures for their 
CMO&#8217;s. Recognizing the role of emotions and measuring emotional responses 
provides competitive advantage for the firm as well as job security for the CMO!
