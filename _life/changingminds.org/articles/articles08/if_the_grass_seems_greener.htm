If The Grass Seems Greener Across The Street, Maybe They're Using Better 
Fertilizer</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: </i>Dr. Alan Zimmerman</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Relationships: </h2>
<p>As a child, I remember wanting some things that other people had. I wanted 
certain things to be in my family or in my relationships. And I remember being 
told that the grass just seemed greener on the other side. It really wasn't. </p>
<p>Well now I'm an adult, and I know better. Sometimes the grass is greener on 
the other side. But I also know there's a reason. The people across the street 
may have a better looking lawn or a stronger relationship because they're using 
better fertilizer. </p>
<p>The challenge for you and me is to stop wasting our time, gazing at our 
neighbor's lawn. We need to spend more time tending our own lawns and 
relationships. </p>
<p>After all, relationships are not static. They're either getting better, or 
they're getter worse. They don't just sit there in limbo. </p>
<p>So if you're not spending time on your relationships, they will deteriorate. 
Your feelings of love will go from being excited, to exhausted, to expired. Or 
as one cynic said, if you're not careful, you'll go through the three phases of 
marriage: lust, rust, and dust. </p>
<p>The same is true at work. If you stop building your team, it will start to 
disintegrate. If you take your customers for granted, they'll begin to look 
elsewhere. You're either investing in your work relationships or you're 
divesting those relationships. </p>
<p>The problem is--relationships are a lot of work. I suspect that's why so many 
relationships fail. Some people just don't realize how much effort is required. 
As comedian Rodney Dangerfield says: &quot;We sleep in different rooms. We eat apart. 
We take separate vacations. We do everything we can to keep our marriage 
together.&quot; </p>
<p>Bob Ettinger puts it this way. He says, &quot;Relationships are hard. It's like a 
full-time job, and we should treat it like one.&quot; But then he adds: &quot;If your 
boyfriend or girlfriend wants to leave you, they should give you a two weeks' 
notice. There should be a severance pay, and before they leave you, they should 
have to find you a temp.&quot; Of course, Bob is being whimsical, but you get the 
point. You should take your relationships as seriously as your job, and you 
should work just as hard at it. </p>
<p>Other relationships fail because people don't know how to work on their 
relationships. They don't know what to do or what would work. I tell those 
people that they can get by on charm for about fifteen minutes. After that, 
they'd better know something -- about relationships. </p>
<p>So what works? I could talk and teach on that topic for a long time, but let 
me offer a few tidbits from my program on &quot;The Relationship Recipe: Rapport, 
Respect, and Recognition.&quot; </p>
<p>First, ACKNOWLEDGE THE AWESOME SIGNIFICANCE OF RELATIONSHIPS. In other words, 
remind yourself that nothing is more important than your relationships, not your 
career, your money, or your possessions. In fact, if you had everything but 
relationships, you would soon question the value of life itself. The actor, Yul 
Brenner, said it well. He said: &quot;You're born alone. You die alone. And if you 
can accept that as total reality, any relationship you have along the way will 
never be taken for granted and will truly be a gift!&quot; </p>
<p>Second, HONOR THE OTHER PERSON. Honor is a strange word in our culture, a 
word that's not used very often and is frequently misunderstood. It simply means 
to place a high value on the other person, to decide that he or she is very, 
very valuable. </p>
<p>Nothing could be more critical. Dr. John Gottman, at the University of 
Washington, says, &quot;No relationship skill works without honor.&quot; In fact, through 
his research, he can now predict with about 100% accuracy that divorce will 
occur when spousal honor drops to too low of a level. </p>
<p>You've got to honor the people at home, and you've got to honor the people at 
work. But remember this. Honor is given to the other person. It is not earned!
</p>
<p>Of course, it's easier to honor some people than others. That's life. But if 
you want a strong positive, working relationship with someone, you've got to 
give honor to that other person. And one way you do that is to compile a list of 
all the things you admire about the other person. The longer your list, the more 
powerful your honor will become. </p>
<p>Then, GIVE TO THE OTHER PERSON. Of course, that sounds simplistic and 
superficial. It's not. In actuality, giving is at the heart of every successful 
relationship and every successful business. When people see you as a giver, they 
want to work with you. </p>
<p>In a broad sense, give self-esteem. Help the other person to feel better 
about himself. As John Powell says in his book, The Secret Of Staying In Love: 
&#8220;The essential gift of love is a sense of personal worth. My love must empower 
you to love yourself. We should judge our success in loving not by those who 
admire us for our accomplishments, but by the number of those who attribute 
their wholeness to our loving them, by the number of those who have seen their 
beauty in our eyes, heard their goodness acknowledged in the warmth of our 
voices.&quot; </p>
<p>And give without expectation. If you give expecting something in return, 
you're sure to be unhappy. If you say &quot;Good morning&quot; to someone, expecting him 
to respond in kind and he doesn't, you'll get all bummed out. You'll probably be 
telling yourself, &quot;I knew I shouldn't have said 'Good morning'.&quot; </p>
<p>When you give, just make sure it's because you want to give, not because 
you're expecting something in return. As one of the foremost psychiatrists of 
all time, Alfred Adler said, &quot;All human failure can be attributed to man's 
inability to grasp that it is better to give than receive.&quot; </p>
<p>Finally, SPEAK WORDS OF KINDNESS. Mother Teresa said, &quot;Kind words can be 
short and easy to speak, but their echoes are truly endless.&quot; In other words, 
they keep on giving, and they keep on building your relationships. </p>
<p>Of course, your choice of words is very important. Just like fertilizer, the 
correct fertilizer will build your lawn, but the wrong fertilizer will poison 
it. </p>
<p>I once heard a minister say, &quot;I have heard people confess to breaking every 
one of the Ten Commandments except the ninth, 'Do not bear false witness against 
your neighbor.' Yet this is the one we break most often, and it can cause 
irreparable damage.&quot; </p>
<p>Someone asked Mohammed how he could make amends for falsely accusing a 
friend, for saying unkind words about the other person. Mohammed told him to put 
a goose feather on each doorstep in the village. </p>
<p>The next day Mohammed told the man to go and collect all the feathers. &quot;It 
can't be done,&quot; cried the man. &quot;The wind blew all night, and the feathers have 
scattered everywhere.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Exactly,&quot; said Mohammed, &quot;and so it is with the reckless words you spoke 
against your neighbor.&quot; They can't be taken back. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Action for Relationships: </h2>
<p>Select a relationship of yours that needs to be strengthened or needs to be 
fertilized. Then work on increasing your HONOR of the other person by writing a 
list of at least twenty things you admire about that person. </p>
<p>When the timing is right, SPEAK WORDS OF KINDNESS by telling that other 
person some of the things you listed.</p>
