The Folly of First Impressions</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Thejendra BS</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has often been said that you don&#8217;t have to commit a great deed for someone 
to like or hate you. You can be admired or despised for just about anything you 
do or don't do. And everyone on our planet has their share of admirers and 
haters from people they know or don't know. But why and how do people like or 
hate somebody, even the ones they have never met before or personally interacted 
with? The obvious answers could be plenty, but the starting trigger for this 
judgmental behavior usually lies in one hidden reason. And that hidden reason is 
the &quot;first impression&quot; or a &quot;memory burn&quot; that occurs with the very first 
encounter we have with someone. People make their lasting impressions and 
judgments about others within the first 30 seconds of and encounter. The 
encounter can be in the form of a meeting, reading, hearing or just seeing 
something (positive or negative) about them. In many cases people even form 
pleasant to completely warped opinions of someone just by looking at a 
photograph of that person who they don't even know. And first impressions are so 
powerful that its effects can often last a lifetime, and will influence all 
future mutual interactions. While this could be a popular method of framing 
judgments by millions of people, blindly following such a method always can 
often do more harm than good. Though many people swear by first impressions, but 
on close examination they are often wrong and misleading in most of the cases. 
For example, to see how easily we can be influenced by what we read let us take 
a small joke that I had read somewhere. The slightly modified joke is as 
follows.</p><p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Suppose it is time to elect a new world leader and you have to take a decision, 
and only your vote counts. And you have to make a selection based only on the 
candidate's description without knowing who exactly they are, while their real 
names are inside a sealed envelope. Now who would you vote for?</p><p>
<b>Candidate-A</b>: Associates with crooked politicians, and consults with 
astrologists. He's had two mistresses, chain smokes, and drinks 8 to 10 martinis 
a day.</p><p>
<b>Candidate-B</b>: He was kicked out of office twice, sleeps until noon, arrogant 
type, used opium in college and drinks a quart of whiskey every evening.</p><p>
<b>Candidate-C</b>: He is a decorated war hero. He is mostly a vegetarian, always 
smiling, loves his own people, doesn't smoke, drinks an occasional beer, and has 
never cheated on his wife.</p><p>
Which of these candidates would be your choice? It will most probably be 
Candidate-C.</p><p>
Now open the envelopes and read out the names.</p><p>
Candidate A is Franklin D. Roosevelt</p><p>
Candidate B is Winston Churchill</p><p>
Candidate C is Adolf Hitler</p><p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The above example shows how one can be fooled by what you read and easily frame 
opinions about someone without digging further. This is how people normally get 
misled by first impressions. We quickly frame opinions and judgments of others 
without even meeting them based on what we hear, read or see about them from 
various sources. It happens to each one of us many times in our lifetime. So if 
you had all along believed that first impressions were useful or guaranteed 
judgment methods, here are a few reasons why you should never solely depend on 
them.</p><p>
On our planet a very large percentage of people give too much importance to 
first impressions to form their permanent perceptions about someone. But it is 
wrong to brand a person permanently based on what you saw or heard for a brief 
time. Maybe you caught the person at the wrong time or wrong place. Maybe you 
were not getting the complete picture or facts. Being in the wrong place at the 
wrong time is not a crime or always avoidable. Everybody cannot be in the right 
place at the right time, or say the right things at the right moment to make a 
stunning first impression. The same rules applies to you also. Hence people need 
several impressions both ways to know and understand each other. It takes a long 
time to understand someone and cannot be based on some singular or brief 
incident. Appearances can be deceptive. It has been said people look normal 
until you get to know them better. The reverse is also true. People can also 
look abnormal until you get to know them better. Hence you should always aim to 
know people leisurely, and you will soon discover they just have faults 
different from that of yours. And history is full of numerous cases of people 
who have made awesome first impressions, but failed miserably later. For 
example, a well-dressed and smooth talking person displaying a great first 
impression may eventually turn out to be a con man, while a mediocre person with 
an initial shabby personality may prove to be an honest trustworthy person. To 
quote another example, when we first met our college biology professor most 
students were taken aback at his small meek structure and somewhat odd behavior. 
But when he started his lectures on botany he was awesome. His lectures were so 
electrifying and he could hold the entire class into a hypnotic trance through 
his powerful teaching and great anecdotes. Though a lot of students were aiming 
for engineering, nobody would miss his class, and not a single cranky student 
would disturb his session.</p><p>
First impressions should not be confused with intuition, which is entirely 
different. Intuition is a mysterious message we get than can give us a warning 
about someone. The first impression I am referring are mainly about real world 
stuff like physical appearance, dress, handwriting, mediocrity, shyness, weak or 
strong hand shakes, color, speech abilities or disabilities, nervousness, 
etiquette issues, ignorant and unintentional acts, cultural behaviors, etc. 
Don't judge a book by its cover. Lack of flamboyance is not a lack of capability 
as believed by Mary Kay Ash, the legendary founder of Mary Kay Cosmetics, a 
billion dollar cosmetics giant. It has often been said she never paid much 
attention to anyone's physical appearance, and always focused on who he or she 
was as a person. Positive dressing and impressive displays, though necessary in 
the business world, can never be a substitute for getting things done and 
achieving results as a reputed manager once said, &quot;Give me a team in denims and 
T-shirts who can do the job efficiently, caring for the customers and who are 
real and secure about themselves than people with very little substance.&quot; Often 
people who spend too much time dressing and behaving elegantly to make great 
first impressions are usually hollow, as they often spend too much time in front 
of the mirror and too little time growing their knowledge, products and people.</p><p>
Many people proudly claim they have the magic or psychic ability to easily judge 
a person just with one glance or a brief encounter. But such a claim is 
completely naïve and misleading. Only ignorant or gullible people take first 
impressions as permanent characteristics. Except in some hardcore cases, the 
person you may have seen last year is not necessarily the same person next year, 
as human beings are dynamic creatures and constantly changing (or evolving) for 
better or worse. But true professionals, leaders and credible establishments 
like the law courts in most developed and democratic countries never get 
influenced or carried away by first impressions. They always believe in thorough 
investigation, facts, proof, etc., no matter how tedious or long it takes. They 
always make their independent assessments about someone based on facts. 
Otherwise, if first impressions were assumed to be correct and let loose, then 
thousands of people will be hanged, lynched and buried alive based on media 
hype, overwhelming public opinion, trial by media, newspaper reports, etc.</p><p>
However with all the above arguments against first impressions there are certain 
areas and a percentage of cases where judgments based on first impressions are 
true and correct. On our planet nothing is 100% right or wrong. So, for example, 
while dealing with street punks, people who are a menace to society, the 
stubbornly obnoxious, criminally oriented, and those who deliberately exhibit 
boorish or uncouth behaviors, etc., you can easily take your first impressions 
as final without bothering to investigate further. But you must consciously 
remember that such cases will normally be applicable only to a small percentage 
of cases, and any negative experiences based on such encounters must not be 
universally applied to the remaining large percentage of cases.</p><p>
Finally we can conclude this article with a great quote from Violet Asquith, a 
British politician, who said, <i>&#8220;The first time you see Winston Churchill you see 
all his faults, and the rest of your life you spend discovering his virtues.&quot;</i>
