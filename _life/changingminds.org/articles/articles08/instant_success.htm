Instant Success</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: William Frank Diedrich</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People say there is no such thing as instant success, but I say that there 
is. Success is a way of thinking. Success has to do with how you feel. You may 
have a lot of money, but if your thoughts and emotions have you in a terrible 
state, then you really aren&#8217;t successful. Why do people achieve goals? Why do 
entrepreneurs start businesses? They do it because they believe it will make 
them feel a certain way. They will feel accomplished, victorious, joyful, or 
free.</p>
<p><b>Success is in the mind. </b>People tell themselves that they will feel successful 
when they get the money, obtain the right job, find their perfect mate, or lose 
the weight. Success is a someday thing in this context. Someday never comes. </p>
<p><b>Success is a gift you give to yourself. It is a way of thinking.</b> Success 
thinking creates the emotions of success including joy, peace, personal pride, 
self respect, freedom, and gratitude. </p>
<p>If you do not see or feel yourself as successful right now, you are but a 
thought away from it. <b>Success is one thought away from where you are right now.</b> 
The distance between your current thoughts and success thoughts may seem 
overwhelming. This is due to your physiology. You see, constant repetition of 
negative thoughts (blaming, complaining, victimized, anger, etc.) trains your 
body to react in certain ways. Physiologically, you are wired to feel the way 
that you do. Constant practice of negativity and doubt build those emotions into 
your body. Your physiological responses can be changed. </p>
<p>Since we are often battling physiology when we attempt to make changes, it is 
the body we must employ as our change agent. Here are some steps you can use to 
create success: </p>
<ol>
  <li>First, there must be an intention to succeed. Failure and giving up have 
  payoffs we must be willing to give up. We must be willing to take 
  responsibility for our own lives. When we intend to create success we 
  recognize that our success, past, present, or future, is not up to anyone 
  else. No one can stop you from being successful. </li>
  <li>Following up on your intention, there must be a decision you make to 
  succeed. You make this decision every day. Every time you experience 
  disappointment or setbacks, you decide again to succeed. </li>
  <li>You must envision success. It is important to write out a vision that 
  includes what your life would look like. More importantly, you need a vision 
  that articulates what kind of person you want to be. Words like confident, 
  loving, compassionate, forgiving, helpful, competent, joyful, tenacious, 
  graceful, grateful and others come to mind. In this vision of your success, 
  who are you being? </li>
  <li>Focus on the feelings that you believe are part of being successful. If 
  you were successful right now---if you felt totally successful right now--how 
  would you be sitting in your chair? What would your posture be like? How would 
  you carry yourself? Get up out of your seat and walk across the room. How 
  would you walk? Go greet someone or talk to someone on the telephone. How 
  would you greet and talk to someone if you were successful? </li>
  <li>Consciously bring the feelings and thoughts of success into every part of 
  your body in each of the parts of your life. In other words, you are not 
  looking for success--you are being success. </li>
</ol>
<p>Some may say that that&#8217;s nice, but it is play acting. It is like living in a 
dream world. This is true. You are acting and it is living in your dream world. 
Success comes from the inside out. In order to create your successful world you 
must first live in it in your mind. </p>
<p>So, if you want a promotion, how would you walk and talk if you were already 
in that position? How would you deal with people? How would you approach your 
work? If you were a great leader with big responsibility and compensation to 
match, would you be tracking how many hours you work each week? Would you be 
gossiping about your coworker? Or, would you be fully engaged in the moment, 
making decisions that benefit the highest good for the organization? Would you 
be complaining about how unfair certain people or situations are, or would you 
be envisioning positive situations and taking constructive steps to create them?
</p>
<p>Someone said to me: &#8220;I can play at being successful but I&#8217;m really not. I 
still don&#8217;t have the money I need. I still don&#8217;t have the influence I need. I 
don&#8217;t have time for games like these.&#8221; This reaction is common and 
understandable. My first question is: &#8220;How much money, influence and love have 
you gained by worry or by feeling sorry for yourself?&#8221; Generally speaking, other 
people are not going to help you be successful because they feel sorry for you. 
People gravitate toward success. Whether you want others to buy from you, vote 
for you, listen to you, or join with you, they are going to be more interested 
if you are successful. If you see yourself and feel yourself as successful, 
others will agree with you. Motivational writers and speakers call it: &#8220;Fake it 
until you make it.&#8221; </p>
<p>Personally I don&#8217;t think we are faking it at all. That confident and joyful 
person we envision is who we really are. As we set aside the negative thoughts 
and emotions of blaming, complaining, resentment, and general unforgiveness we 
expose who we really are. You are already a success. If you can imagine it and 
feel it, you can be it. </p>
<p>Give yourself the gift of instant success right now. Sit, stand or somehow 
begin moving as if you are already successful. Practice will build the positive 
emotions of success into your physiology. Your body will become wired for 
success. It will truly be the servant of a success oriented mind. As you move 
forward in confidence your outer conditions will begin to change to reflect your 
inner success.</p>
