Recruit Your Way to the Top!</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: John Boe</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Essentially a sales manager's primary responsibility is to recruit, train and 
motivate his or her sales force to achieve peak performance. Of these three 
vitally important tasks, recruiting is the least understood and by far the most 
challenging. </p>
<p>When you recruit the right person you will find that they're self-motivated 
and eager to train. On the other hand, if you hire someone that is not suited 
for the position, you'll experience low morale, high turnover and find yourself 
constantly in the training mode. </p>
<p>While there's no perfect system that can guarantee you'll hire the right 
person every time, there are fundamental guidelines you must follow if you 
expect to recruit your way to the top! </p>
<h3>Are You a Buyer or a Seller? </h3>
<p>It pays to be patient and selective during the 
interviewing process. Obviously, what you're looking for is a hard- working, 
self-motivated, team player and not just a warm body to fill the position. By 
approaching the interviewing process with a buyer's mentality, you're more 
likely to maintain your objectivity and hire a long-term top producer. </p>
<p>During the initial interview, the vast majority of sales managers have a 
tendency to oversell the position. These well-meaning managers make the 
fundamental mistake of describing the sales profession in its most favorable 
light by over-emphasizing the compensation potential and understating the 
inherent challenges. </p>
<p>Buyers understand the importance and the responsibility of being 
straightforward and laying all of their cards on the table. They know through 
experience that it is better to run the risk of scaring off a prospective hire 
than to face a disillusioned salesperson after the fact. Buyers tell it like it 
is by emphasizing the demanding aspects of the sales profession such as 
rejection and hard work. By placing a few roadblocks and challenges in front of 
a prospective hire you are able to check his or her interest and validate their 
resolve. </p>
<h3>The Process Makes the Difference </h3>
<p>You'll never see a bad resume. Buyers 
understand the absolute necessity of doing a thorough reference check. In 
addition to the standard questions regarding character and work ethic, it's 
always a good idea to ask his or her reference, &quot;In your opinion, if 
(candidate's name) were to fail as a salesperson, what do you think the reason 
would be?&quot; This question is never anticipated and frequently invites the most 
insightful discussion. </p>
<p>I strongly recommend that you use a checklist, because it allows you to stay 
on message and helps you to remember important questions. Relying on your memory 
is a poor business decision and will normally come back to haunt you. Take good 
notes throughout the interview. If you talk more than you listen during an 
interview, you're a seller and not a buyer. </p>
<p>As a manager there are several benchmark questions you need to keep in mind 
during the interviewing process. Ask yourself, does the candidate make a 
favorable first impression and would you want this person working for your 
competition? </p>
<p>You would be fooling yourself not to anticipate that your prospective hire 
has been coached and is well prepared for a standard office interview. With this 
in mind, I suggest that you conduct two formal interviews followed by a social 
interview. The initial interview is designed primarily to probe for general 
suitability such as punctuality, communication skills, financial stability and 
evidence of past success. Its been said that both success and failure leave a 
trail. Look for past experiences where they have faced difficulties and have 
shown the resiliency to bounce back. This approach lends itself to a valuable 
discussion about the necessity of being self-motivated and maintaining a 
positive attitude in the sales profession. </p>
<p>To allow for reflection, temperament testing and verification of references, 
I would advise a minimum of one week between interviews. Consider setting up 
some hurdles between the first and second interviews that will allow you to 
measure interest and personal responsibility. When I was a sales manager, I 
would invite both my potential hire and his or her spouse out to dinner or to a 
sporting event. When you're interviewing a salesperson for a commission-based 
position, it's imperative to check for spousal support. </p>
<p>Here are my Favorite Eight Interview Questions: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Do you have written goals you want to accomplish and if so, tell me about 
them? You are looking for indications of maturity, focus, planning ability and 
desire for achievement. </li>
  <li>How did you earn your first paycheck, how old were you, and what did you 
do with the money? With this question you are probing to check his or her work 
ethic. </li>
  <li>What are the top three leadership traits that you look for in a manager? 
With this question you are attempting to gauge his or her expectation and 
preferred management style. </li>
  <li>Have you ever failed at something and if so, why did you fail and what did 
you learn from the experience? This question lends itself to a discussion on 
resiliency, personal responsibility and tendencies under pressure. </li>
  <li>Everyone has strengths and weaknesses as employees. What are your strong 
points for this position? This question gives them the opportunity to tell you 
what assets they bring to the table and how they see themselves fitting into 
your organization. </li>
  <li>What is the one thing you would improve about yourself? This question 
gives you an indication of his or her self- assessment capability. </li>
  <li>Other than family members, who has been the greatest influence in your 
life and why? </li>
  <li>If you were to fail in this business, what do you think the reason would 
be? </li>
</ol>
<h3>Temperament Profiling is an Absolute Must </h3>
<p>A sales manager who lacks the 
benefit of temperament understanding is inclined to place too much emphasize on 
his or her gut-level feeling during the hiring process. Progressive 
organizations that understand the value of temperament profiling actively seek 
people with varied behavioral styles and thereby benefit from a richness and 
diversity of perspective. People with different behavioral patterns are more 
likely to complement rather than duplicate each other's strengths and serve in a 
check and balance capacity. </p>
<p>Managers frequently ask me which traits are the most important to look for in 
a prospective hire? In my opinion, there are two mandatory qualities any new 
hire should possess. The first quality I look for is loyalty. If a person is not 
loyal to their company, research indicates that they are more likely to violate 
company policies and procedures. Disloyal employees are also the first to leave 
when the going gets tough. Look for signs of job stability on the resume and 
check his or her attitude regarding previous employers. </p>
<p>The second quality I look for is dependability. It makes absolutely no sense 
to invest huge amounts of emotional and financial capital training someone that 
you can't depend on. </p>
<p>The most effective people are those who know themselves, know the demands of 
the situation, and adapt strategies to meet those demands. Research indicates 
that career incompatibility is the major cause of personnel discontentment and 
costly turnover. The hidden cost of excessive personnel replacement is often 
measured through a decrease in customer retention. </p>
<p>Simply put, you want to hire a person that has a temperament profile 
compatible with the job opportunity. For example, some people are born 
analytical and have a temperament style that excels in administration and 
attention to detail. Others are more comfortable in a supportive role and are 
better suited for a customer service position rather than the uncertainty of 
commission sales. </p>
<p>The importance of matching the job description to the correct temperament 
style cannot be overstated. Temperament testing is not only advantageous for 
hiring and suitability but also as a management aid to assist in training and 
supervision after the hiring process. I strongly recommend that a temperament 
evaluation be administered between the first and second interview. </p>
<p>When a temperament evaluation is properly implemented and utilized in 
conjunction with other standard hiring and interviewing procedures, it ensures 
that applicants are treated fairly without regard to race, color, age, religion, 
gender or national origin. If a temperament evaluation is used as part of a 
hiring process, it shouldn't constitute the total basis for hiring or placement. 
I recommend that an organization establish and utilize a consistent standard 
hiring process. Information gathered in each step of the hiring process should 
be reviewed in total prior to making a final hiring decision. </p>
<h3>You're Only as Good as Your Pipeline </h3>
<p>While some turnover in your sales force 
such as retirement, promotion, and transfer is understandable and can be 
anticipated; the quitter is often unpredictable. With this in mind, recruiting 
must be thought of as a long-term strategy, not a knee-jerk reaction. </p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest mistake a manager can make is underestimating his or her 
turnover. If your personnel turnover is high, it's more than likely caused by 
improper recruiting, rather than inadequate training or a lack of incentives. 
Even if you're the world's best trainer and motivator, if you haven't recruited 
correctly you'll experience high turnover and may find your sales team bogged 
down with low morale. If your recruiting pipeline has dried up, here are four 
tips that will assist you in filling it back up with quality salespeople! </p>
<ol>
  <li>To have an effective recruiting program, it's imperative that your sales 
team be enthusiastically involved in the recruiting process. Let them know that 
their ability to recruit is considered a vital skill in leadership development 
and that their assistance is essential to the health of the organization. </li>
  <li>Keep your sales team informed by focusing on recruiting as an agenda item 
at the weekly meeting. On the agenda show the status of each recruit, 
highlighting the salesperson that has recruited them. </li>
  <li>Design and implement an incentive program for your sales force that places 
an emphasis on recruiting. </li>
  <li>Consider inviting potential new hires out for lunch and cultivate 
relationships with clients that you think may be successful on your sales team. 
Make certain to include them in your company's social events when appropriate. 
  </li>
</ol>
<p>I hope I have inspired you to look at your recruiting program with fresh eyes 
and a renewed determination to recruit your way to the top! </p>
