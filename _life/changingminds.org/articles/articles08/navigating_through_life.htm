Navigating Through Life</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Ronit Baras</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="quote" align="center"><i>A journey I just don't have a map for</i></p>
<p class="quote" align="center">
&#8211; Darren Hayes</p><p>
As you all know by now, I love quotes. In one of his songs, Darren Hayes (Savage 
Garden) sings about &#8220;a journey I just don&#8217;t have a map for&#8221;. I realised that I 
also talk about &#8220;the journey&#8221; and about finding the map to navigate it with. I 
think this phrase describes the way most people feel about life &#8211; confused, like 
they&#8217;re on a journey without a map, with circumstances that control their lives, 
without the ability to choose their path.</p><p>
Every person in the universe is searching for happiness. Looking for that one 
&#8220;map&#8221; that everyone else is looking for, the one we think will fit us all. But 
we all have different things that make us happy. Therefore, we each use a 
different map to guide us to our &#8220;happiness&#8221;.</p><p>
In our journey toward happiness, we take roads, stop at stoplights, drive 
through dirt roads and encounter round-a-bouts. Some roads are longer than 
others, some are shorter. In some, we face junctions, some in which we get stuck 
at, not knowing what&#8217;s stopping us.</p><p>
Our internal map is made of things that happen to us during our lifetime. This 
is why there are as many maps as there are people on Earth. Our beliefs are the 
roads on this map. If I believe that &#8220;people can&#8217;t be trusted&#8221;, then I will 
ignore the road called &#8220;people are doing the best they can&#8221; and never ever set 
foot on it. If I believe that &#8220;I have wonderful children&#8221;, I will ignore the 
road called &#8220;my daughter wasn&#8217;t nice to my son&#8221;, even if I cross it many times. 
People like to take the roads they know, even if they are slow, long or even 
painful. And the more they take a road, the more they ignore other roads.</p><p>
We start drawing our maps from childhood. We draw nice and not-so-nice roads, 
long and short roads and use our beliefs as the pencil. We draw roads and signs 
to allow us to navigate our life in the future. It is the certainty we draw, the 
same confidence you have when you hold a map and try to find a friends house in 
an unknown city. How do we actually form our beliefs?</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">
<i>The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in determination</i></p>
<p class="quote" align="center">
&#8211; Tommy Lasdora</p><p>
There are 5 sources we take our beliefs from: Education, Environment, Media, 
Past Outcome and Creative Thinking.</p><h2>
Education</h2><p>
Mum, dad or a teacher said something when we thought they were gods, so we 
created a road. The more they said it, the more defined my road became. &#8220;You are 
very responsible child&#8221;, they said and, sure enough, whenever I have to choose 
between being responsible or not, I take the road of &#8220;responsibility&#8221;. If they 
said &#8220;you&#8217;re forgetful&#8221;, many years later, the road of forgetting would be the 
road I would take, without stopping to really choose. My road just seems like 
the only one there.</p><h2>
Environment</h2><p>
We look at the people around us, the way they dress or do their hair and we 
create roads like &#8220;only girls have long hair&#8221; and eliminate any trace of &#8220;long 
hair looks good on guys too&#8221;. We grow up in a certain type of neighborhood, 
where the houses are made of timer, and learn to believe that it&#8217;s like that 
everywhere, not ever being able to imagine tall buildings made of bricks and 
concrete. We hear a certain language spoken by everyone and expect strangers to 
be speaking the same language when we meet them.</p><h2>
Media</h2><p>
TV and newspapers have the ability to shape many of our beliefs. Millions of 
people take roads they only see on TV, like drinking roads or smoking roads. Do 
you know how many women around the world take the road &#8220;if I use Revlon&#8217;s 
moisturizer, I&#8217;m going to look as pretty as the model on TV&#8221;? Other roads like 
&#8220;all moisturizers just add water to the surface and a $3 moisturizer can do the 
same&#8221; are ignored, since the companies selling the $3 product do not advertise 
on TV (If they did, their product would not cost $3, would it?). Media has a 
huge effect on our belief systems. We are taken on certain roads so many times 
that, after a while, these roads become familiar and comfortable to us.</p><h2>
Past Outcomes</h2><p>
During our life, we experience many things ourself and draw conclusions from 
them. We smile at people and they smile back, so we decide, &#8220;if I smile at 
somebody, they will smile back at me&#8221;. We say some nasty things to our sister 
and get chased around the house and finally caught and we decide &#8220;it hurts to be 
nasty to big sisters&#8221;. In much the same way, we form beliefs about what we are 
good at, what we can and cannot do, how others respond to things we do and so 
on.</p><h2>
Creative Thinking</h2><p>
Our goals for example, come from our creative thinking. This is a source where 
we create the belief in our own mind. We imagine it will happen and force our 
subconscious in that direction. Many athletes successfully use this technique in 
their training. Since the brain cannot distinguish 100% between imaginations and 
reality, we use our imagination to pretend it is a road that is possible to 
take.</p><p>
</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">
<i>The only thing that stands between a man and what he wants in life is often 
merely the will to try it and the faith to believe that it&#8217;s possible</i></p>
<p class="quote" align="center">
&#8211; David Viscott</p><p>
We form many of the beliefs without being aware of having formed them. We adopt 
them from our parents, teachers, circumstances, observations and imagination. If 
we look into them and the time when we adopted them, we will find that at the 
time we were young, with a different mindset, in different circumstances and 
with less knowledge. It may have been in a different culture or a different 
financial situation.</p><p>
The circumstances may not be the same now, but that&#8217;s irrelevant, because every 
belief we make, we keep until we choose to change it. For example, when I was 
young and it rained, it was cold and I formed the belief that it always rains 
when it is cold. Now that I live in Brisbane, it rains when it is hot, yet I 
dress warmly. I have confused my body with my belief.</p><p>
Some of our beliefs are so strong that we do not notice other roads, which could 
set us free. To explain what I mean, I will tell you a story (I love telling 
stories):</p><h2 class="quote">
The Little Elephant</h2><p class="quote">
One day, a boy went to the circus with his father and saw a huge elephant tied 
to a tiny stake with a rope. </p><p class="quote">
&#8220;Daddy&#8221;, asked the boy, &#8220;This Elephant is so big and strong and the stake is so 
small and short, he could set himself free just by taking two steps to the side. 
Why doesn&#8217;t he do it?&#8221; </p><p class="quote">
And his father said, &#8220;My son, when this elephant was very small, just a baby, he 
did try to break away from this stake, but he wasn&#8217;t strong enough. He tried and 
tried for months, until he finally gave up, believing that it is impossible to 
break free. Now, he does not try anymore, because he does not believe it is 
possible. We are the same, my son. Many things happen to us at childhood, which 
we try to change, but then stop trying. Many of us are still tied with ropes to 
tiny stakes, just like this big elephant&#8221;. </p><p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I am sure you&#8217;re asking yourself &#8220;Well, does it mean we have to try again and 
again? When do we learn that certain things are simply impossible and shift our 
energy to other things?&#8221; The answer to that is &#8220;Never! As long as something is 
important to you, it&#8217;s possible and you should try to get it again and again&#8221;.</p><p>
You see, Thomas Edison tried 1,500 different types of wire to use on the light 
bulb. 1,500! Do you understand that if Edison thought like us, we would never 
have light? In a sense, if we do not think like Edison, we stay in the dark.</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">
<i>Success is determined by those who prove the impossible possible</i></p>
<p class="quote" align="center">
<i>&#8211; </i>James W. Pence</p><p>
In coaching, we learn to examine our belief systems. We learn to review our 
beliefs and leave only the ones that are good for us to have. We learn to revise 
them to suit our new age, culture, role, circumstances and mindset. In other 
words, we bring our beliefs up to date. We learn to choose the roads of 
acceptance, love and motivation, roads that are easy to navigate, where 
happiness is part of our daily life. We choose roads full of light!</p><p>
May the light shine on you and may you find your way even in the darkest 
moments.</p><p>
