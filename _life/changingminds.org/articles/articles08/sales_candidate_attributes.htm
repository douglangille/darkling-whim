Sales Candidate Attributes: Desired or Required</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Lee B. Salz</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="quote"><i>Companies spend tons of money trying to attract sales talent through job 
boards, yet they impair that campaign with what they put in their ad.<br>
</i>
<br>
</p>
<p>Close your eyes. Think of the perfect mate. Are you done? Close your eyes 
again. Think some more. How long is your list of requirements of the perfect 
mate? Are there five of them? Ten? Perhaps, you have twenty. Think about your 
list again. Are each of those really requirements of your ideal mate? Or, are 
those desired attributes? On which items are you willing to be flexible? For 
example, some people say the religion of their mate is a requirement while 
height is only desired. For others, it is the other way around. </p>
<p>People make decisions every day based on their desired and required aspects. 
There are some aspects on which people can compromise and others where they 
cannot. This challenge hits employers when they are trying to attract sales 
talent to apply for their open positions. Instead of creating ads on job boards 
that invite folks to apply, they tightly close the spigot. I regularly look at 
the job boards to see how companies are attempting to attract great sales 
talent. What I find is interesting. Companies place an ad listing what 
attributes are <i>required</i> of the candidate. However, when I speak to companies 
about their ad, I find that many of the items on their list fall more in the 
desired category. </p>
<p>I've also talked with sales people about their perceptions of a job 
advertisement that lists requirements. &quot;I look at the list of requirements in 
the posting and if I don't have 100% of the background, I don't submit my 
resume&quot;, said a sales person actively looking for a new role. When I ask 
employers about their biggest challenges, finding great candidates ranks high on 
their list. &quot;It just seems that we place an ad on a job board and we get few 
candidates to respond,&quot; said one employer. </p>
<p>Here is the disconnect. Employers publish job advertisements to lure sales 
candidates to apply. Yet, that same tool is choking the entire process. In 
essence, instead of enticing candidates to apply, they are convincing them that 
they won't be considered. </p>
<p>Here is an example of the requirements section from a job board advertisement</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The successful candidate <u>must</u> have </p>
<ul>
  <li>BA/BS with a focus on business or life science</li>
  <li>An MBA from a well-respected institution</li>
  <li>10 years sales management experience</li>
  <li>10+ years business to business sales experience to the Fortune 1000</li>
  <li>Broad knowledge of principles and methods in a recognized professional field, 
or working knowledge of multiple fields</li>
  <li>Well-versed in using CRM tools</li>
  <li>Experience selling in disciplined, formal sales methodology is essential</li>
  <li>&nbsp;Must be good at developing and articulating ROI to C-Level Executives 
  </li>
  <li>Telecommunications experience is a must </li>
</ul>
<p>How many people meet this list of criteria? Very, very few. Would this 
company really not consider a candidate that met the most critical elements of 
their criteria, but was missing an element or two? Well, by publishing an ad 
that is so restrictive, those candidates won't apply. The company misses out on 
those potential superstars. </p>
<p>I'm a huge proponent of formulating a profile of a company's ideal sales 
candidate. Yet, if that profile is so restrictive that only one person in the 
world matches it, how will this company ever hire anyone? I'm not suggesting 
that companies reduce their standards or that they hire sub-par performers. No 
one wins in those instances. However, there are two follow-on steps of the 
process. </p>
<p>Let's say you have come up with twenty items for your ideal sales candidate 
profile. The next thing to do is to rank them in importance so that each item is 
ranked one through twenty. The first one on the list is the one deemed most 
important. In essence, you are prioritizing the importance of the criteria. Not 
much different than what people subconsciously do when searching for a mate. </p>
<p>Once that is done, the next step is to categorize each as either required or 
desired. I won't insult your intelligence by defining those. Start with number 
twenty (least important from the prior exercise) and work your way down to 
number one. If this exercise was done correctly, the lion share of the items 
become &quot;desired&quot; while the finite few at the top become required. It is the few 
items that are deemed critical to one's success in the job that should be listed 
as required in an ad. </p>
<p>This is a challenging set of exercises, no doubt. That's the whole point. You 
want to make sure you encourage the right candidates to apply versus 
discouraging them. Thinking back to the company who had the laborious list of 
requirements. Would they really not hire a really bright individual who lacks 
the MBA component of the profile? If the answer is no, they shouldn't list that 
in their ad as it discourages potentially strong candidates from applying. Did 
they put the requirement of a telecommunications background in the ad because 
they prefer not to teach the industry? If the answer is yes, then they wouldn't 
want to put that in the ad because they could miss out on a superstar sales 
person who needs a little assistance learning the business. </p>
<p>This issue isn't limited to candidates and employers. Recruiters are 
frustrated too. The company provides them with such restrictions that they feel 
handcuffed in their ability to find the right candidates. &quot;I really want to help 
my client, but I feel like I'm searching for a needle in a haystack. I don't 
dare send any candidates unless I find an exact match to what they've given me,&quot; 
says one recruiter. Continuing on, &quot;I don't think they intend to be so 
restrictive, but that's what they have given me to work with.&quot; </p>
<p>Attracting great talent is very difficult to do. The great ones are typically 
wedded to their employer. Don't let the few great ones that are in the market 
get away. Make sure your communication to attract talent is formulated to truly 
represent what was intended. <br>
