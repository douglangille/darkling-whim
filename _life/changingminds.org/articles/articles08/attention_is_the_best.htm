Attention Is The Best Rapport-Builder</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Christopher R. Edgar</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I enjoy writing and public speaking, and generally put a lot of importance 
on verbal expression, I haven&#8217;t always given my nonverbal communication the 
attention it deserves. Traditionally, I&#8217;ve had mixed feelings about becoming 
more aware of the messages my body conveys to others. On one hand, I understand 
how central body language is to creating rapport between people. On the other, I 
don&#8217;t want to get overly self-conscious about my nonverbal communication, and to 
go through my everyday interactions filled with anxiety about the impression my 
body is creating. </p>
<p>This was before I learned that the best way to build rapport with someone 
else&#8212;to create a sense of connection with them&#8212;is simply to give them your full 
attention. People, I&#8217;ve found, can sense when your attention is completely 
focused on them, and when they do, they feel deeply secure, relaxed and 
understood. </p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t as easy as it sounds. Many of us are accustomed to letting our 
minds wander when we talk to others, and only half-listening to our conversation 
partners. Some of us plan or worry about our daily activities while we&#8217;re 
conversing; others mentally rehearse what they&#8217;re going to say when the other 
person finishes; and still others are constantly looking around for something 
more interesting in the surrounding environment. To be fully attentive, we have 
to quiet these mental distractions. </p>
<p>Nor does simply appearing to listen help. I&#8217;m talking about actually giving 
someone your full attention&#8212;not moving your body or speaking in an effort to 
convince them they have it. For instance, it&#8217;s possible to make unbroken eye 
contact, lean your body forward so as to pick up every word, and say &#8220;yeah, I&#8217;m 
listening,&#8221; but for your awareness to be lost in your own thoughts. If this is 
happening, you won&#8217;t achieve the kind of rapport you want, and the other person 
will get a nagging sense that something is out of place. </p>
<p>I first recognized this during a conversation with a friend a while back. She 
is an inveterate worrier, and she tends to bring up basically the same anxieties 
with me every time we talk. After a while, I have to admit, I got tired of 
running over the same list of problems, and I started using the moments when 
she&#8217;d bring up her worries as opportunities to think about other tasks I needed 
to deal with. My eyes would be focused on hers, and I&#8217;d nod and acknowledge what 
she said, but my attention would be elsewhere. </p>
<p>One day, I decided to try a different approach. I did my best to empty my 
mind of thoughts of the past and possible future, and to place my full attention 
on her as she spun her tale of woe. I fixed my awareness not only on the words 
she was saying, but on the tone of her voice and the place it seemed to be 
coming from in her body. </p>
<p>After I&#8217;d spent a few minutes in this state of simply perceiving her, without 
any mind activity, I started noticing subtle changes in her behavior. Her eyes 
began to widen and look more alert, and she began to grin and giggle even as she 
listed her anxieties. Eventually, she broke into a full smile, and the 
conversation completely shifted gears from her unhappiness to how much she 
enjoyed seeing me again. I did nothing to create this change in her, apart from 
listening with an undistracted mind. </p>
<p>Another interesting observation I made was that giving my friend my full 
attention improved my own emotional state. When I held her in my thought-free 
awareness, a warm feeling spread through my chest, and I experienced the joy of 
being with her more richly. I felt completely willing&#8212;and wanting&#8212;to listen to 
anything she said, even if it was her standard list of woes all over again. </p>
<p>In that moment, it struck me that &#8220;paying attention&#8221; is a somewhat misleading 
expression. The idea that I&#8217;m &#8220;paying&#8221; attention to someone implies that I&#8217;m 
giving them something without receiving anything in return&#8212;or, perhaps, that I&#8217;m 
expecting them to somehow &#8220;repay&#8221; me in the future. In fact, however, lending my 
friend my undivided attention helped both of us enjoy the conversation. </p>
<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve made a conscious attempt to bring my full attention to the 
interactions I have in my daily life. Whether I&#8217;m talking to a client, a loved 
one, or the guy who takes my order at the coffee shop, I&#8217;ve made a habit of 
putting aside my outside concerns and fully holding that person in my awareness. 
I&#8217;ve found that, even though the words used in my regular interactions haven&#8217;t 
changed much&#8212;I still ask the coffee shop guy for a drink and thank him when he 
gets it&#8212;my conversations have a new sense of freshness and vitality about them.
</p>
<p>Scholars in diverse fields have long understood the connection between fully 
listening to a person and building rapport with them. Psychologist Karl 
Menninger, for instance, wrote that &#8220;[l]istening is a magnetic and strange 
thing, a creative force. The friends who listen to us are the ones we move 
toward. When we are listened to, it creates us, and makes us unfold and expand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Similarly, physician Gary Allan Ratson observes that devoting your full 
attention to someone is more likely to create a sense of connection than any 
&#8220;attention-paying&#8221; body language. As he writes, &#8220;[i]t&#8217;s more than our welcoming 
smile, warm eyes, gentle movements, and sincere tone of voice that warms 
another&#8217;s heart. These are manifestations of the primary loving awareness that 
puts people at ease, makes them feel at home, and assures them that someone 
cares.&#8221; </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re hoping for more meaningful and fulfilling interactions with others, 
the most important practice I can recommend is to bring full awareness to your 
conversations. This works best when you pay attention to more than just the 
other person&#8217;s words&#8212;when you can hold their movements, voice tone, and other 
aspects of their expression in your awareness, they feel understood and 
respected, and rapport tends to follow naturally. Not only is it pleasurable for 
others to receive your full attention&#8212;you&#8217;ll also feel more joy in your 
interactions when you&#8217;re completely focused on them. </p>
