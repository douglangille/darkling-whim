Think Like a Coward</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Thejendra BS</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The business world has changed significantly and rapidly in the last decade. 
Regardless of the industry, more and more businesses are operating on a 24x7 
global basis. Even tiny organizations with less than a dozen employees depend on 
several modern technologies and worldwide competition to remain in business. 
Nowadays it is not possible to run any business using the same methods and 
processes that were used five or ten years ago. To stay in business, alive and 
breathing, is of paramount importance to every modern organization. Less than a 
decade ago concepts like disaster recovery and business continuity were almost 
unknown or just considered as optional academic subjects. The only traditional 
method organizations followed for disaster recovery (DR) or business continuity 
(BC) was to enroll into some insurance for their key equipment along with a few 
optional covers. But protecting today&#8217;s business is well beyond having some 
insurance covers and keeping your fingers crossed. </p>
<p>An important question facing organizations today is how to protect their 
business from various predictable disasters that can strike at any time? 
Secondly, who are the best persons to protect your business? What sort of 
qualification and mindset does one need to work in a DR and BC department? Where 
and how can you find or identify such persons? You may say that my questions are 
actually stupid because DR/BC is almost a mature science, and there are umpteen 
numbers of consultants, templates, certifications and best practices readily 
available to everyone. If organizations need to establish DR/BC it is easily 
possible to get competent resumes by the hundreds within hours of posting a job 
advertisement. So what is the big deal? Yes, agreed, there are ample sources 
qualified candidates, books, resources, etc., on DR/BC issues. However, in spite 
of all such available resources, what is that secretive unique skill that is 
essential to become a successful DR/BC manager or a team member in any complex 
modern organization? A a skill that no training program or certification can 
teach. And how exactly should a DR/BC manager be different and unique from the 
rest of the employees in an organization? If you are eagerly expecting me to 
describe that unique skill you are probably going to be a trifle disappointed. 
This is because I am going to describe a skill that history and society has 
never been kind to, something that most people feel uncomfortable, or despise to 
be one. The kind of people I am recommending for DR/BC departments are those who 
can think like cowards, talk like cowards, plan like cowards, and constantly 
spread a healthy dose of cowardice around the organization. </p>
<p>Every organization that is serious about risk management should nurture, 
promote, and respect cowards in their DR/BC departments to protect their 
businesses from countless risks. Now you may loudly argue why does any 
organization need cowards? Nobody has ever erected a statue honoring a coward. 
No management guru or a business school professor drools over a coward. Everyone 
insists on the need for brave leaders everywhere, someone who can make tough 
decisions, are flamboyant, lead, motivate, inspire employees, thrill customers, 
and boldly take the road less traveled. Nobody has ever heard of a coward who 
does all that. True, braveness, toughness, and all those groovy and flamboyant 
leadership skills are required to grow and run a business. But if you can think 
a bit warped and out of the box, such people are not exactly suitable to protect 
the business because of what they are and what they don&#8217;t want to be. Let me 
begin my argument in favor of cowards with a simple joke. </p>
<p>A ship&#8217;s captain wanted some sailors for his ship. So he called a dozen 
hefty-looking chaps and asked who in the group were brave and excellent 
swimmers. About five of them lifted their hands. To everyone&#8217;s surprise, the 
captain selected the remaining seven as his sailors. When asked why he chose the 
cowards he replied, &#8220;The chaps I selected do not know how to swim and are not 
very brave. So they will try the hardest to keep the ship afloat.&#8221; </p>
<ol>
  <li><i>Investing in cowards could be the best business decision you can take 
  to save your business from predictable and even unpredictable disasters</i>. A 
  Chinese proverb says, &#8220;Only a coward can create the best defenses.&#8221; This 
  method should be your approach to protect your business. A brave man usually 
  does not bother to create many defenses because he is always confident that he 
  has the power and strength to withstand and tackle any danger. Also they are 
  incapable of seeing risks the way a coward can. But a coward knows there are 
  always countless dangers all around that he cannot tackle, so he tries to 
  build the best possible defenses. He sees risks and dangers in practically 
  anything that normal people cannot. Applied to your business he or she can 
  smell and see a risk in an instant like a shark that is able to smell blood 
  from miles away. </li>
  <li><i>Cowards have a special advantage that nobody has</i>. They have no 
  limits in their ability to seek and cover risks. They see that things ordinary 
  people cannot. They always think in an extreme, paranoid fashion. Fear 
  controls his imagination. A coward trusts no one, not even himself fully. 
  Cowards have an &#8220;I will believe it when I see it&#8221; and &#8220;Prove it to me&#8221; 
  attitude and do not visualize their workplace from behind fancy status reports 
  and colorful metrics. They don&#8217;t believe anything they have not personally 
  seen working to their absolute satisfaction. They can get into nitpicking 
  details and views from countless directions. </li>
  <li><i>Cowards think beyond technology. </i>They go beyond just data 
  protection, backups, and standby servers. Today with the amount of computers, 
  software, communications equipment, etc., DR/BC is often assumed as an IT 
  thing. But risk prevention is beyond IT and pure techie stuff. They see a 
  slave-sized tech support team managed by a clueless IT manager as a bigger 
  risk to the organization than losing all its data due to a server crash or a 
  virus attack. </li>
  <li><i>For a coward everything is viewed as a risk</i>. Fear helps a coward 
  build fantastic fences. A brave leader will not hesitate to go to war. But a 
  coward will prevent war from happening as long as possible. For example, a 
  brash and brave manager may take a quick decision to fire an employee on 
  flimsy grounds. But a coward will think of how this incident could affect the 
  business, what safeguards are currently available, and how the situation could 
  take shape. A coward thinks in terms of lawsuits, or the political contacts 
  the employee may have, or the indirect damages an aggrieved employee could do 
  to the organization. </li>
  <li><i>Cowards think like ants. </i>In case you did not know, ants think 
  winter all the time. Ants collect food throughout the summer, as they know 
  winter will set in fast. So they collect the maximum amount of food and other 
  useful material to survive the winter. They know when winter sets in they will 
  not be able to move out or get food easily. Hence they do not waste their 
  summers by enjoying the sun and loafing around. When winter sets in they enjoy 
  the fruits of their summer labour. Similarly a coward knows good times never 
  last long enough nor come often. So they take the maximum precaution to see 
  that the organization has saved enough for a rainy day by not being 
  extravagant in the first place. </li>
  <li><i>A coward knows that there are no such things like a best approach, best 
  managers, best employees, or a best strategy. </i>He only knows what is 
  possible or not possible within the constraints and limitations of his 
  organization. Cowards always take a moderate approach. They avoid hype, 
  flamboyance, and big bang approaches in all business functions, projects, 
  deals, etc., as they know the reputation, financial, and other risks involved 
  in melodrama and the obvious spectacular failures ahead. </li>
  <li>7. Brave leaders claim they see the horizon clearly, but a coward is more 
  worried about the pothole near his leg. A coward has a 360-degree vision and 
  many eyes and ears. They think small, medium, and big and see the world 
  through a combination of a magnifying glass, microscope and a telescope. He is 
  someone who will look in eight directions while crossing a one way street.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Just when you thought there was no hope for cowards on this planet, you can 
now see an entire DR/BC industry eagerly waiting to grab and nurture them. Now 
that we have seen how a coward can be of use to every organization, when can we 
see a job advertisement that goes like this? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Wanted: XYZ Corporation, a reputed global company, is seeking suitable 
candidates for its disaster recovery and business continuity department. The 
right candidate must think like a coward, talk like a coward, and must be brave 
enough to admit they are cowards. They should be capable of seeing risks in a 
manner that regular employees cannot, and must have a paranoid personality.</i></p>
