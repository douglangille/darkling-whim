Being trustworthy won&#8217;t make you a Trusted Adviser!</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Ian Mills</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="quote"><i>Why don&#8217;t they trust you enough? Ian Mills, Chief Executive of Transform 
People International examines the way customers buy professional services and 
high value products and the importance that they place on relationships. Is the 
quality of your relationship the real answer to earning more profitable long 
term revenue from every customer? </i> </p>
<p>Trust. It&#8217;s a key issue in every relationship and it&#8217;s the pillar of every 
business relationship. But what does it really mean and how can you increase the 
value of every business relationship by better managing the Trust Quotient 
you&#8217;ve established with every customer? Trust will mean different things to 
different customers. For example, at a personal level some customers may make 
value judgements about the way you dress, your accent and even your culture. To 
other customers, none of this matters because they place the value of the 
relationship on skills, service and delivery.</p><h2>
Crucial concerns</h2><p>
However, there are common themes that research tells us are crucial to all 
customers, including:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Dependability&#8211; the way you deliver against the promises you make.</li>
  <li>Integrity&#8211;how you operate to a consistent framework of principles such as 
honesty.</li>
  <li>Credibility&#8211;the ways in which you display your knowledge and expertise.</li>
  <li>Empathy &#8211; how you show that you intimately understand your customers 
business, their challenges and their priorities.</li>
  <li>Customer Centricity &#8211; the adoptive focus of your solutions against the issues 
your customer faces ... taking the &#8220;you&#8221; and not &#8220;we&#8221; approach.</li>
  <li>Consistency &#8211; ensuring that your customer experiences the same quality of 
service, regardless with whom they engage, whenever they engage with your organisation and whatever commercial challenges they face.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Think about this. You&#8217;ve had an enjoyable relationship with your customer, 
probably for a number of months, possibly even years. The trouble is that the 
customer has never really spent as much with you as you know they could and as 
you think they perhaps should. Something tells you that, for whatever reason, 
you have not acquired as big a share of the customer&#8217;s wallet as you&#8217;d like. The 
customer seems to &#8220;trust you&#8221;, but does not appear to see you as a &#8216;Trusted 
Adviser&#8217;. They reserve that status for their accountant, or their lawyer, their 
best friend from business school ... or, dare I say, even their spouse, or 
partner. But why?</p><h2>
Who are you?</h2><p>
You now face two choices: you can give up and move on, or you can wrestle with 
the problem and take back winning control of the situation. It then becomes a 
question of who you are. Are you a sticker, or a quitter? Most decision-making 
customers would confirm that a key characteristic of a Trusted Adviser is their 
relentless pursuit of value add solutions where there is a win:win outcome to 
wrestle with and negotiate.</p><p>
If you want a bigger share of customer&#8217;s wallet, there are two routes you can 
adopt. </p><p>
<b>Route 1 </b>means bombarding them with services, products, help and assistance. You 
can hit them with lots of backup and support and offer every other trick the 
universal sales manual teaches you. But to be brutally honest, it won&#8217;t make a 
whole lot of difference what you do. You may find that they buy more and more 
frequently because you strike lucky once or twice with a premium price product. 
Your share of their wallet will significantly improve, but only in the short 
term. Without a better quality relationship this customer will always be &#8220;at 
risk&#8221;. When a better product becomes available from another source this customer 
will transfer their allegiance to your competition.</p><p>
You may have demonstrated to the customer that they can trust you, but you have 
not yet gone beyond the status of a &#8216;trusted transactional vendor&#8217;. You have not 
shown the customer that what you have to offer is centred on their needs &#8211; it&#8217;s 
been more about your short term need to sell more, quickly.</p><h2>
Earning &#8221;Trusted Adviser&#8221; status</h2><p>
<b>Route 2 </b>is to take a look at the Trusted Adviser Grid (see in
<a href="How%20Trustworthy%20Are%20You.doc">How Trustworthy Are You.doc</a>) and be 
ruthlessly honest with yourself. Think about where you would plot your customers 
on the grid and follow these simple steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Read the 10 relationship descriptors such as dependable, brave, trustworthy.</li>
  <li>Consider how many of these descriptors your customer would use if we asked 
them to describe your relationship.</li>
  <li>The number that apply will determine where the customer is on the horizontal 
axis eg: if three out of the ten apply then the customer will be 30% along the 
line from the left and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In terms of the vertical axis:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Consider not only what the customer is currently buying from you and your 
competitors, but also what you feel they should be buying if they really 
understood the value you are offering.</li>
  <li>Based on whatever measure you choose (revenue, contribution, number of 
products...) determines how far up the axis the customer should be placed in the 
same way as before 30%, 50% and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Join the dots with the other axis and the position will determine the start 
point for planning your engagement strategy.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p>
<h2>Trusted Adviser Grid&#8482; - Possible Strategies</h2>
<p>For examples, see <a href="How%20Trustworthy%20Are%20You.doc">How Trustworthy 
Are You.doc</a>.</p>
<h3>Intuitive and inspirational</h3><p>
The Trusted Adviser Grid is a remarkably intuitive and inspirational device. In 
simple terms, it tells you where you stand and indicates what you have to do to 
drive every customer relationship towards Trusted Adviser status. And you can 
apply it easily to any industry or market sector.</p><p>
But of course the sheer simplicity of the Trusted Adviser Grid also masks its 
working complexity. How do you make the changes that are necessary by person, by 
team, by region, department and division to make all of your business 
relationships bear even better and bigger fruit? How do you get your people on 
the right road to success?</p><h3>
What does this mean for you?</h3><p>
Decision-making executives will invest more time, will buy more, will provide 
references to new opportunities that validate their own buying decisions, will 
help shorten the time it takes to close business by cutting through complex 
processes ... with their Trusted Advisers. In short, a Trusted Adviser will 
generate long term and profitable revenue by focusing on customer-centric 
behaviours and will not simply concentrate on the amount of revenue they have 
delivered this week or quarter. </p><p>
The challenges that all business professionals should be rising to are to 
re-examine their day to day behaviours, ensure that they are not adopting a one 
size fits all approach to customer relationships and proactively understand what 
kind of relationship their customers actually want. Only then can they really 
say that they are on the road to Trusted Adviser status.</p>
