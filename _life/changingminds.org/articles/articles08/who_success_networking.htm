Who Else Wants To Know How To Become Successful Through Networking</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Andrew Rondeau</i> </p>
<p class="quote"><i>How many times have you heard 'to be a successful leader you 
need a network'? Lots of times? Never? Well it is true. Read this article and 
find out the why, how and where of networking. </i></p>
<p>It's hard to be in business today, certainly in the professional services 
sector, without having heard the term 'networking'. Regarded by many as the 
Marmite of business, it is said that you either are a networker or you aren't. 
And if you think you aren't, you shouldn't even try to do it. </p>
<h2>Rubbish! </h2>
<p>First of all, networking is essential to any business. The business you get 
from personal recommendation will be some of the best business you ever do - 
they have pretty much made up their minds to use you before they even call you, 
and they are a lot less concerned with price. And it's not just for solicitors 
and accountants - when your pipes burst, how did you decide on a plumber to come 
out and fix it? Was it someone you had heard good things about before? Maybe you 
didn't know anyone, so you called a friend and asked if they knew a good 
plumber? Joe Bloggs Plumbers just won the business of fixing your pipes through 
networking. </p>
<h2>And how about your word of mouth? </h2>
<p>Not enough people concentrate on generating referrals and getting people to 
mention their business to others. Millions of pounds of business is done every 
year through referral and recommendation. If you're not getting any of it, you 
need to think long and hard about why not. </p>
<p>So you've got yourself to a networking event, you tell the people there about 
what you have to offer, and then ask if they want to buy it, right? Wrong! If 
you do this you have become the person at a networking event that everyone wants 
to avoid - the one handing out business cards like they're dealing a poker game; 
the one who asks you nothing and tells you more than you could ever want to know 
about what they do. </p>
<p>So how do you do it? The best way to network is to build trust, build 
relationships, to think about what you can do for the other people in the room 
before you think about what you might get. Be a 'people person', be genuinely 
interested in the people you meet at events. Great networkers want to help as 
well as get help - because they like helping others, not just because it might 
get them some business in the future. </p>
<p>Networking is about building a relationship that eventually leads to business 
being done, either between you and your new contact, between you and someone 
they recommend, or between them and someone you recommend. Don't discount that 
last one - they have to get something out of your relationship as well, 
otherwise it isn't a relationship. If you help them get more business, they will 
do the same for you - in fact they'll feel obliged to. </p>
<h2>Where can I network? </h2>
<p>The short answer is absolutely anywhere! Remember Joe Bloggs Plumbers, the 
guys who fixed your pipes? You don't find many plumbers at networking events, 
but they still get referrals. Networking happens when you talk to your 
colleagues at work, when you go to the pub with your friends, it happens when 
you overhear a conversation in the bus queue. Networking is about the impression 
you leave people with, and you make impressions all day, every day. </p>
<p>Of course you will make more effective contacts for referrals at specialised 
networking events, but remember there are several different kinds of events you 
can go to. Some of the most established are breakfast meetings, which usually 
start around 7.00am and finish around 9.00am. Meetings are usually weekly and 
the format is very focused and regimented. For those who like this format, there 
is a lot of business to be done, but it is an acquired taste. Try it out, but 
bear in mind whether or not you can keep up with the regular early mornings and 
very formal structure. Also, most breakfast meetings are restricted to one 
person from each business sector, so you are not as likely to meet people you 
can form alliances and joint ventures with, which is a very important, and often 
overlooked part of networking. </p>
<p>There are also several different kinds of event organised by groups such as 
local government organisations, such as race days, golf days and others. These 
can be a lot of fun, but are very often filled with people who are there for the 
golf rather than to do business, and you may have to kiss a lot of frogs to find 
your prince. Networking events are really a matter of preference and 
perspective, and you should go to as many events as you can at first, and then 
stick with the ones that work for you. </p>
<p>In summary, there is a simple and effective way to network that anyone can 
do: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Get to know people as people, not prospects. </li>
  <li>Everything happens after a meeting, not during. Always, always follow up.
  </li>
  <li>Give referrals as well as expect to receive them. </li>
  <li>Keep in touch on a regular basis. </li>
</ol>
<p>Best of luck with your networking! </p>
