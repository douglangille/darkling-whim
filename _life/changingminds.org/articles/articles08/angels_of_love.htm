I believe that love is the answer 
- Blessid Union of Souls</p><h2>
The key holder</h2><p>
&quot;Once upon a time, in a small village, lived a family. They had a small guest 
house at the back of their property, where people passing by stayed for the 
night. All four of their kids helped in the guest house and when they finished 
their chores, went to play with the other kids - all but the second son, Tom. 
Tom was a very quiet and a sad boy. He never smiled, never laughed and the other 
kids did not want to play with him. </p><p>
One day, an old man came to the guest house and Tom, who loved listening to the 
guests' stories, showed the old man his room. </p><p>
&quot;What is your name, son?&quot; asked the old man. </p><p>
&quot;Tom&quot;, said the boy. </p><p>
&quot;Tell me Tom, how come you are not playing with the other kids outside?&quot; asked 
the old man and took off his shoulder a heavy bag, which made a metallic sound.
</p><p>
&quot;They make fun of me and call me names&quot;, said Tom and helped the old man unpack.
</p><p>
&quot;That is not nice. What do you love Tom?&quot; asked the old man and open the bag, 
showing hundreds of big, heavy metal keys. </p><p>
&quot;Nothing&quot;, said Tom. Then, thought about it for a second, &quot;Actually, I love 
stories. The guest here have wonderful stories&quot;, he said, &quot;What about you?&quot; </p><p>
&quot;I love keys&quot;, said the old man and shook his bag, &quot;What about fears? What are 
you afraid of?&quot; he asked Tom, putting his hand into the bag and looking for a 
key. </p><p>
&quot;I am afraid of the kids and that one day people will stop coming to our guest 
house and that someone might get hurt&#8230;&quot;, but before he finished his sentence, 
the old man held a key in his hand and said excitedly, &quot;Yes, I have got it&quot;, and 
he came closer to Tom. </p><p>
&quot;Come, sit next to me. I have the key you need&quot;, said the old man and showed Tom 
a large metal key. &quot;I'll tell you a story. Legend says that just before you were 
born, the angles had a farewell party for you. As a gift, they gave you two 
boxes - one was a love box to put all the good and happy things in your life and 
one was a fear box, to hold all the things you do not like or are afraid of. 
When you open the love box, angles fly around you and make you even happier, but 
when you open the fear box, demons take over and you feel scared and sad. We all 
had that gift at our farewell party. We were given the boxes, but we didn't get 
the keys to open them.&quot; </p><p>
Tom looked at the bag of keys and got his hand in. The keys were very heavy. </p><p>
&quot;Why do we need the keys?&quot; asked Tom. </p><p>
&quot;To open the love box and close the fear box&quot;, said the old man. </p><p>
&quot;Do you have the keys?&quot; asked Tom. </p><p>
The old man smiled. &quot;I am the key holder. I have just the key for you&quot;, he said 
and handed Tom the key. </p><p>
Tom held the key in his hand. He felt strong and happy. He smiled and remembered 
the magician guest who showed him some magic tricks. That was fun. He looked at 
his key and it made him feel great. For a second, he forgot the old man, who 
walked back to his bag and tied it slowly. Tom was so happy and excited he 
wanted to run to the kids outside and show them his magic love key. His love box 
was wide open. </p><p>
&quot;Thank you, thank you! It is a wonderful key. Can I keep it?&quot; asked Tom. </p><p>
&quot;Sure, it is yours&quot;. </p><p>
&quot;What about your key?&quot; asked Tom. </p><p>
The old man showed him a heavy key on a chain around his neck. </p><p>
&quot;I'm fine. My key is safe and sound&quot;, he said and started packing his things.
</p><p>
&quot;Are you leaving already?&quot; asked Tom in fear. His parents would be upset to see 
the old man leaving so soon. </p><p>
&quot;Many keys to deliver&quot;, said the old man and stood at the door with the bag of 
keys on his shoulder. Tom looked at the key around his neck. There was only one 
key. He could not stop thinking about the fear box. He felt the demons all 
around him and he wanted to keep them locked. </p><p>
&quot;What about the other key?&quot; Tom asked the old man just before he left his room. 
The old man turned his head to Tom and smiled. </p><p>
&quot;The fear box opens only when the love box is closed&quot;, he said and left the 
room. </p><p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Some say that there are only two feelings in the world - love and fear. In this 
philosophy, love and fear are categories of emotions, so we have two boxes: good 
feelings belong in the love box and bad feelings belong in the fear box. </p><p>
In the love box, there are feelings like: joy, pride, happiness, compassion, 
kindness and fun. </p><p>
In the fear box, there are feelings like: sadness, frustration, guilt, 
disappointment and anger. </p><p>
If you can divide the entire range of feelings to these two categories, life is 
much easier. Think about it, if you feel good, your love box is open and allows 
angels to spread in your body. If you do not feel good about something, your 
fear box is open and allows the demons to float freely in your system. </p><p>
Love and fear are ranges of feelings. At any second in life, you either have 
angles or the demons in your system. It is the number of demons or the number of 
angles that determines how successful you feel, how much fun you have, how 
frustrated or angry you are. </p><p>
A similar philosophy claims that <i>there is only one feeling in the world - love - 
and that fear is the absence of love</i>. </p><p>
People are emotional beings. Everything they do is meant to give them a feeling, 
hopefully from the love box. Unfortunately, many people dedicate too much time 
to find ways to close the fear box, instead of focusing on opening the love box.
</p><p>
Remember, <i>the fear box opens whenever the love box is closed.</i> </p><p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Tips to open your love box: </p>
<p>1. Learn to recognise which box is open at any given moment - is your feeling 
based on fear or on love? </p>
<p>2. Whenever you are afraid, hold your imaginary key next to your chest. You hold 
the key to open your love box. You have the power! </p>
<p>3. Make a list of all the things that make you happy. How many? The more, the 
better, but aim for 100. </p>
<p>4. Make a list of all the things you are grateful. Again, go over your life and 
remember to mention every tiny thing you are grateful. </p>
<p>5. Tell someone how much you love him/her. </p>
<p>6. Call someone you have not talked to for a while. </p>
<p>7. Write a success journal and record all the good things that happened to you 
during the day. </p>
<p>8. Hang around people with huge open love boxes. It is contagious. </p>
<p>9. Make a random act of kindness. </p>
<p>10. Give your partners a list of the ways they can make you happy and ask for 
their list. </p>
<p>11. Pick one item from your list every day and make yourself happy. </p>
<p>12. Dream! </p>
<p>13. Go over your childhood album and bring up good memories. </p>
<p>14. Find a job that opens your love box every day. Our work takes a lot of 
energy. If you have demons at work, find ways to bring angels. </p>
<p>15. If you are afraid of change, you are taken by demons. Letting go creates a 
great feeling of freedom and it has many sprinkles of angles. Practice letting 
go. </p>
<p>16. Smile! It is free. There are lots of angles in each smile. </p>
<p>17. If things do not happen the way you want them to happen and there is nothing 
you can do about it, move on. Moving on in spite the challenges requires the 
love box to be open. </p>
<p>18. Many people have an open fear box because they do not know they have the 
key. Forgive them! If you use your love key often, it will help everyone around 
you find theirs. </p>
<p>19. Hug, hug a lot. You need 12 hugs a day</p>
<p>20. It is 2008, so come up with 2008 things you want to do in your lifetime 
things that will keep you happy, motivated, empowered, healthy and successful.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And to add things to your box, I send you all lots of love with part of the 
song &quot;I Believe&quot; by Blessid Union of Souls because I too believe love is the 
answer. </p>
<p class="quote">&quot;&#8230;Cause I believe that love is the answer <br>
I believe that love will find the way <br>
I believe I believe I believe I believe that love is the answer <br>
I believe that love will find the way <br>
Love will find the way <br>
Love will find the way <br>
Love will find the way <br>
Please love find the way <br>
Please love find the way&#8230;&quot; </p>
<p>Sending you angels</p><p>
Love</p><p>
