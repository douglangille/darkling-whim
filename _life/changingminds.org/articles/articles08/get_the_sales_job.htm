Secrets to Getting the Sales Job You Want!</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Lee B. Salz</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="quote"><i>If you are in sales, pursuing a new job is much like pursuing a sales 
prospect. Your marketing tools have to present you in the most relevant light. 
This article tells you how to effectively use them. </i> </p>
<p>The compensation plan changed again. The revolving door of company executives 
spins out of control. You look at the corporate direction and you'd like to give 
the CEO a compass so he can find his way. Concerned, you've decided that today 
is the day that you will peek your head over the cubicle wall and see what other 
opportunities are out there. After all, you've been successful. No need to go 
down with the ship. </p>
<p>The morning you wake up with the inspiration to begin a job search is a 
little scary. There is the factor of the unknown. Yet, you pushed yourself 
outside of your comfort zone to open the doors to new opportunity. It's been a 
while since you last looked for a new sales home. How do you go from where you 
are today to a new, fresh opportunity? </p>
<p><b>Know what you want</b>. In sales, you often work with the profile of your ideal 
client. The same applies when looking for a job. You need to know what the ideal 
fit is for your sales pedigree. If you don't know what you are looking for, how 
will you know when you find it? This introspective exercise is the subject of 
another article of mine titled, &quot;<a href="../articles/finding_right_home.htm">Finding the Right Home for Your 
  Sales Skills</a>.&quot; 
That article walks you through the exercise of defining your ideal sales role. 
Don't go another step in the process until you have read that article. </p>
<p><b>Develop your marketing tools</b>. Marketing tools? Yes, that is what a cover 
letter and resume are all about. When you think of marketing, you also think of 
messaging. Many forget this when they develop their cover letter and resume. 
However, these marketing tools communicate a message, a story. The key is to 
make sure they convey the story you intend. </p>
<p>While the easy thing to do is to create one cover letter and one resume, it 
is not the most effective way to pursue a new job. As someone who has screened 
thousands of these documents from sales candidates, I can share with you a 
little nugget of insight. Hiring managers ask themselves a simple question when 
they first peruse your cover letter and resume. &quot;Do they want my job or just a 
job?&quot; We know when you are mass emailing your marketing tools just like 
prospects know when you mass email them. </p>
<p>In sales, you are taught to make sure your message matches your audience. 
Sales is not taught as a one-size-fits-all, but rather a template that is 
adjusted to match the need and circumstance. When prospects feel that they are 
the sales call of the day, they don't respond. The same applies to hiring 
managers. Hiring managers are looking to hire people that want to work in their 
organization. They can feel when someone just wants a job, not necessarily 
theirs. Thus, when they get that feeling, your candidacy for the job goes into 
the trash. </p>
<p>The cover letter is one of the first ways it becomes obvious that you are 
treating this as a mass event. The sales person applies for a specific job, but 
the cover letter communicates a message that says they want a different job. It 
is not intentional on the part of the sales person. After all, they paid a 
copywriter a thousand dollars to create this masterpiece. Copywriters are very 
helpful to those in need of assistance in creating the story of their 
background. However, the effective cover letter recipe has three ingredients to 
it, making it somewhat difficult for the copywriter to unilaterally assist you.
</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Share what you know about the company. </b>Hiring managers want to see that 
you have at least done a little research about them. This is easily done by 
visiting their website, performing an online search, and studying them on 
Hoover's. </li>
  <li><b>Present your relevant qualifications/accomplishments. </b>The keyword here is 
&quot;relevant.&quot; We've all done a lot of things in our lives. Pick the ones that you 
feel are most relevant to the reader based on what you read when you researched 
the company. You can also ascertain this from the job posting. </li>
  <li><b>Show the synergy between the opportunity and your background. </b>Connect the 
dots for the reader. If the company is looking for a sales person that has 
developed a new territory and you are an expert at doing that, make sure the 
message comes out in the cover letter. Don't expect the reader to see the 
synergy. You need to map it out just like you do for sales prospects. When 
presenting the synergies, use their language. If they call the position &quot;a 
hunter,&quot; refer to yourself as one. If they call bringing in new accounts as 
&quot;territory development,&quot; you are in expert in territory development, not 
hunting. </li>
</ol>
<p><b>When the objective, isn't the objective. </b>The same holds true for the resume. 
Many sales people write an objective at the top of their resume. Yet, they fail 
to adjust the title based on the position for which they are applying. My 
favorite is when someone writes as an objective, &quot;To get a sales or sales 
management position.&quot; I can assure you that approach is a guaranteed way to get 
yourself removed from consideration in an instant. Those are two completely 
different jobs. &quot;I want to be a pitcher or the manager of the team. It doesn't 
matter to me.&quot; Again, I just heard you want a job, not necessarily my job. </p>
<p><b>What you've done. </b>The resume is an extension of the cover letter. The message 
should be the same. Highlight the results and areas of expertise that are most 
relevant to this opportunity. I'm not suggesting that you leave certain jobs or 
employment off your resume. However, package each one as best as you can to 
convey the synergy between you and the company. </p>
<p>From the job posting, you can usually infer what is most important to the 
sales manager. Those usually can be found in the section of the job description 
that highlights the candidate requirements for the job. Include bulleted 
descriptions and statistics that map back to those elements. </p>
<p>While the work to customize these marketing tools may seem huge and painful, 
it really isn't. Earlier, I mentioned that you should start the search process 
by identifying the right home for your sales skills. The reason for that 
recommendation was to give focus to your search. It allows you to laser-in on 
those opportunities that best match you. Thus, isn't it worth the time 
investment to customize your marketing tools for those job prospects that are 
best suited for you? Wouldn't you do the same thing in pursuit of a major 
prospect? I certainly hope so. </p>
