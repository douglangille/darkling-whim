<h1>Spread the light</h1>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="../articles.htm">Guest articles</a> &gt; Spread the light</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Ronit Baras</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">
<i>There are two ways of spreading light: <br>
To be the candle or the mirror that reflects it<br>
&#8211; Edith Wharton</i></p><p>
It is looking around the world, at what is happening with starving people and 
violence, which makes me feel small and helpless sometimes. I can remember 
thinking about it ever since I was 15 years old, like Atlas, carrying the weight 
of the world on his shoulders. I wrote poetry, listened to Joan Baez and wrote 
John Lennon's words of &quot;Imagine&quot; on my notebooks.</p><p>
Have you ever been asked about the teachers that influenced your life? Well, it 
has happened to me quite a few times, and I have always given the same answer. 
Reuben.</p><p>
It was in grade 11. I was on the school council and the head the newsletter 
committee. One day, five of us were sitting in the principal's office, 
accompanied by the teacher who had supported us for the entire year. This 
teacher, Reuben, had a family of his own, yet he spent many hours with us, 
during breaks and after school, something no other teacher ever did. He sat on 
&quot;our&quot; side, facing the principal, and moved our chairs into a circle, breaking 
the authoritative seating arrangement.</p><p>
Later on that evening, I asked, &quot;Reuben, why are you doing this? Why are you 
spending all this time with us?&quot; and he said something that changed my life 
forever. &quot;If I make a difference in the life of the five of you and each of you 
will make a difference in the life of some other five, it'll spread, and 
together we will make this world a better place&quot;.</p><p>
I think that, inside of me, I came up with the belief that his words were the 
answer to easing the load of the world. Each of us will make Heaven on Earth 
with the people around us, and together we will make this world a better place.
</p><p>
You see, he never said anything about the pace, about how long we will have to 
live until this starts affecting others. He did not even say anything about how 
to do it.</p><p>
It was only 5 years later, when I studied Special Education, that I learned the 
7% rule, which made another change in my life (except for the other million 
changes that happened every second in my life up until then). I figured out how 
to do it. I came to study Special Education with his words inside of me and was 
a bit surprised to find out that words make up only 7% of our communication.</p><p>
You probably understand how devastating it can be for a writer, who treats words 
as colors in the hand of an artist, to find out that words do not have that 
affect because they represent only 7% of communication. I wondered about his 
words numerous times and realized that what he gave us was his passion, his 
time, his love, his smile and his faith. He gave us encouragement and the belief 
in our ability to make a difference. You see, his words were just a summary of a 
whole year of communicating his belief. He was the candle and we were the 
mirrors to reflect it.</p><p>
It changed my life because I realized that what matters is the things I believe 
in and the things I pass on. I realized that in order to change the world, I 
needed to change myself. I know that, no matter what I do, I am a candle, and if 
I want my mirrors to reflect beautiful light, I have to shine that light. During 
that time, I dived deeper into the journey of self-discovery, brightening my 
candle, or the way we now say it at home, &quot;bettering myself&quot;.</p><p>
Coaching, or personal development, existed since the beginning of humanity. The 
desire to &quot;better ourselves&quot; is probably carved inside of us and learning is the 
greatest tool to achieve this.</p><p>
Brian Tracy, in his books and talks, presents this concept of success as a 
measurement of the drive to get better and better at things that are important 
to us. Technically, if every day we get just a tiny bit better, the effect is 
compounded. This results in faster and faster growth, which is then reflected by 
all the people around us. Together, we can spread the light. </p><p>
It is funny that people typically start the journey of self-discovery at a late 
stage in their life, when they are fed up with the compromises they have made 
and they want to make changes. Funny, because they when they were born, they 
believed they could do and have anything they wanted, but life gradually 
strangled that belief. I believe that with coaching and educating, it is 
possible to help them recreate their belief in themselves and that they then 
touch the life of five others.</p><p>
The most important five people that I chose to spread my light with are Gal and 
the kids. In our house, we have introduced the &quot;bettering myself&quot; concept to our 
19 &#8211;year- old teenage daughter, our 12-year-old son and our 7-year-old daughter. 
It helped us change life from an unconscious existence of doing things &quot;because 
Mum told me to&quot;, or &quot;because everyone does it&quot;, into a sequence of purposeful 
actions.</p><p>
We ask questions like &quot;What can I do today to better myself?&quot; or &quot;Is what I'm 
doing now going to help me better myself?&quot; When a kid is bettering himself, it 
happens so fast because he is so young. Can you imagine what he can achieve in a 
lifetime? Purposeful children never get to be fed up, because they ask 
themselves these questions every day and learn to be responsible for their life.</p><p>
&quot;The bad news: time flies. The good news: you are the pilot&quot;.</p><p>
When you are an adult, you might see the bad news, but children are born to 
embrace the good news. It is amazingly powerful to be in full control, to be the 
pilot. </p><p>
I think Reuben was a &quot;kid&quot; who realized not only that he is the pilot of his own 
life, but also that he is somehow a pilot of the life of all the people he is in 
contact with. I think he changed our life and made this world a better place by 
believing and spreading this belief, by making sure that the other 93% of 
communication will come out shiny and enlightening. </p><p>
I know now that what I write here represents only 7% of my belief and that it is 
possible to read the other 93% in between the lines. So if you do feel sometimes 
that there are bad things in the world, that we have too many wars, fear or 
hunger, think of the light that is fading and brighten your light by looking at 
the mirror.</p><p>
Sing to yourself Michael Jackson's words from &quot; Man in the mirror&quot; </p><p>
&quot;I'm starting with the man in the mirror</p><p>
I'm asking him to change his ways</p><p>
and no message could have been any clearer</p><p>
if you wanna make the world a better place</p><p>
take a look at yourself, and then make a change&quot;</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p>
<p>Until next time, have a safe journey of &quot;bettering yourself&quot;.</p><p>
May the force be with you!</p><p>
