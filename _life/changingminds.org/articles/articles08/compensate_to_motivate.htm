Compensate to Motivate</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Lee B. Salz</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Channeling the energy of a sales team can be challenging. How you compensate 
them determines where they invest their time and the results you get. </p>
<p>When I speak to business executives, one of the challenges I often hear is 
that their sales team is not doing the things they feel are most critical to the 
success of the company. I then ask to see their compensation plan. After a 
thorough read, I share my impression of the message of the compensation plan and 
ask if this is their intention. That's when things get scary! They look at me 
blankly and say, &quot;No, our intention is for our sales people to&#8230;&quot; For them, the 
disconnect has been exposed. </p>
<p>What many forget is that the blessing of sales is that a compensation plan 
doubles as a job description. However, that blessing is also a curse as a 
compensation plan doubles as a job description. As one executive shared after 
going through the aforementioned exercise, &quot;We want our sales people to focus on 
selling our new product to our existing clients. Yet, we are compensating the 
sales people in a way that they are better off pursuing new clients.&quot; He got it!
</p>
<p>The incongruence of sales compensation is one of the biggest disconnects in 
companies. Executives sit in a board room with strategic plans of grandeur, but 
the plan collapses when they don't address the compensation for the sales 
troops. It is a very simple equation. Sales people invest their time on 
activities that drive their compensation. Plain and simple. The thought that 
sales people will actively and consistently perform activities that are not in 
their best financial interests is na?e. </p>
<p>Further complicating matters, there are instances where sales people are 
compensated for delivering certain results while their managers are compensated 
on a different set of results. Thus, the sales managers are driving their team 
consistently with their compensation message, but inconsistently with their 
sales team members. It creates the visual of the sales manager pushing a boulder 
up a hill trying to get their team to focus on activities that contradict their 
income. Best of luck! </p>
<p>When structuring sales compensation plans, a company should strongly consider 
the goals for the company. Working backwards, the goals for the company drive 
the structure of the sales compensation plan. Thus, they should be directly 
aligned. If the company's goal is to gain adoption of a new product in the 
marketplace, the plan should reward sales people for accomplishing this feat. If 
the goal is to increase revenue with their current clientele, the plan should 
reward for that. Anyone should be able to read the plan and derive the intended 
message. </p>
<p>The second consideration, when structuring sales compensation plans, is that 
sales managers and sales people should have alignment with their respective 
results. If one is compensated for adding new clients and the other for selling 
a new product to existing clients, and it does matter which is compensated for 
which, the incongruence causes a paralysis of performance. </p>
<p>Making this more daunting is that in complex sales environments, those that 
have protracted buying cycles, the standard salary and commission model does not 
create enough of a framework to ensure that the sales team performs the right 
activities every day. How do you structure the plan so that the team is 
motivated to do the right things every hour of every day? </p>
<p>Employers also face a challenge of hiring sales people who are concerned 
about the length of time of the buying cycle in contrast to their earnings. The 
standard solution is to bridge the gap with a draw. As you probably know, there 
are two types of draws. There is the recoverable draw which is, in essence, a 
loan against the sales person's future commissions. Then, there is the other, 
the non-recoverable draw which is money, free and clear, to the sales person for 
some period of time. Nothing good comes out of either of these. The recoverable 
draw, almost always, puts the sales person in a financial hole. They wake up 
each morning knowing they owe the company money. No one enjoys the feeling of 
debt. The non-recoverable draw, often times, creates an earnings cliff. Let's 
say that the draw is for three months at $2,000 per month. In month four, the 
sales person probably experiences a significant fall-off in their earnings. The 
end result is relationship damage between the sales person and the company and a 
poor corporate investment. How do you structure the sales compensation plan to 
bridge the earnings gap when recruiting new sales people? </p>
<p>The challenge of motivating sales people and bridging the sales earnings gap 
can be solved with a creative compensation approach. In the 1980s and 1990s, the 
big buzz term was MBO (Management by Objective). Business people were provided 
with a series of objectives, and following a performance review, were 
compensated for achievement of such. What if the MBO concept was applied to 
sales compensation? What if you created a Sales Behavioral Objective or SBO? </p>
<p>If you are reading this and think that I've just created additional sales 
cost, think again. I'm proposing a reallocation of the dollars paid to your 
sales team. A percentage of the dollars normally budgeted for commissions would 
be allocated for an SBO bonus. </p>
<p>Consider this. A company has a typical buying process with its clientele that 
is six months long. They pay their sales people a base salary of $60,000. At 
100% of plan, the sales person earns $90,000 or $30,000 over their base salary. 
However, no commissions are earned in their first six months of employment due 
to the buying cycle. The company, as a means of managing sales behaviors and 
attracting strong sales talent, budgets $15,000 of the $30,000 of commissions 
for the SBO bonus. The sales person is then eligible to earn a $3,500 bonus each 
quarter in year one. </p>
<p>At the beginning of each quarter, the sales person has a formal review where 
the results of the prior quarter are shared and the mission for the second is 
presented. The SBO changes from quarter to quarter based on the tenure of the 
sales person and the needs of the business. The SBO is also not a &quot;gimme.&quot; 100% 
accomplishment should be a stretch goal, but achievable for the sales person.
</p>
<p>In the first quarter, the overall mission is getting the sales person 
assimilated into the company's environment. The measurements of success at the 
end of the quarter are: a business/territory plan, the ability for the sales 
person to call on prospects, and knowledge of the products. As measurement of 
achievement, the company provides a written test on product knowledge, a scored, 
mock sales call, a scored, mock, sales presentation, and review of their 
business/territory plan. Based on the sales person's accomplishments, they will 
receive a percentage of the $3,500 up to 100%. </p>
<p>In future quarters, a points system is put in place, making the SBO entirely 
objective, tied to performing the activities deemed critical for the success of 
the business. In each quarter, the goal is for the sales person to achieve 100 
points. The main objective in the second quarter for this company is to have 
face-to-face meetings with qualified prospects. They are looking for their sales 
person to have twenty face-to-face meetings in the quarter as a way to jump 
start their sales pipeline. Thus, the SBO compensates five points for each 
meeting held. At the end of the quarter, whatever percentage the sales person 
delivers of the 100 points, with a minimum achievement of 75%, is paid as a 
bonus. This includes those who over perform. Why penalize them for doing more of 
the right things? What about quality? How do you know they are doing the right 
things in the prospect meeting? Hopefully, you measured their proficiency in 
doing those things in the first quarter. </p>
<p>The SBO program, in future quarters, is designed by identifying key, 
measurable sales activities aligned with the needs of the business. Place 
weighting on the activities commensurate with your expectations of the sales 
person. </p>
<p>Some of you are probably thinking, &quot;No way, I pay for results!&quot; Well, results 
are a function of doing the right things each and every day. Results are not 
miraculous. They are formulaic. The reality is that you have skin in the game 
with the SBO. As a business executive, you and your team are tasked with 
determining what it takes for a sales person to generate the results you desire. 
If you have done your job of identifying the success metrics and the sales 
person achieves those, the results take care of themselves. The SBO is not just 
for year one since the challenge of managing sales behaviors is perpetual. One 
important key is to budget enough dollars for the SBO bonus that it gets the 
attention of the sales people, but not so high that it overshadows commissions.
</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the SBO program gives you the tool kit to channel the 
energy of the sales team toward achieving that goal. It also provides you with a 
mechanism to attract sales talent to your company where, right on day one, they 
need to perform to earn dollars over their salary. One other benefit of this 
program for those companies with lengthy buying processes, the SBO provides you 
with a way to assess the sales person's performance in a way that you can 
identify, more quickly, those who will not be successful in your company. </p>
<p>One thing is for sure, the executive team of the company in the story knows 
that if they paid a sales person $15,000 SBO bonus in year one, year two and 
beyond are going to be stellar. </p>
