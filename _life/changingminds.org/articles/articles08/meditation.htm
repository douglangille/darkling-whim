Meditation</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>These days people seek knowledge, not wisdom.
Knowledge is of the past, wisdom is of the future</i>
&#8211; Vernon Cooper</p><p>
Two hundred years ago, collecting information was the name of the game. The 
world was ruled by those who mastered the skills of information gathering. 
Knowledge was power.</p><p>
In today's world, the TV world, the world of live broadcasts, of information at 
your fingertips, a fast track world loaded with information, the advantage 
changed sides. Today, the world belongs to those who master the regulation of 
the flow of information. Today, it is not how much you know but how effective 
you are at finding what you need in the overwhelming rush of new facts coming 
straight at you from all around.</p><p>
When I started my teaching journey, believing that all the people around the 
world were gifted, I faced a dilemma. As a person who brought information 
collection to a level of art, I was actually giving my students the greatest 
disadvantage of the 21st century. I was guiding them to where &quot;they couldn't see 
the forest for the trees.&quot;</p><p>
After I realized this, I spent years looking for the balance between collecting 
and regulating. Everything around us encourages collecting. At school, we learn 
how to gather and process information for our assignments, but not how to handle 
the enormous stream of information we absorb anyway.</p><p>
Imagine that your brain is an office, where every piece of information is like 
the people seeking your service or incoming messages requiring your processing 
and filing.</p><p>
Most of the processing happens while you are a sleep. The more information you 
receive, the more time it takes you to process it. Have you noticed that when 
you are stressed you feel tired? Have you noticed that kids sleep much more than 
adults do? That is because the load of information they need to process is 
greater - almost everything is new.</p><p>
Because the world moved into &quot;fast forward,&quot; we receive information that is much 
greater than twenty years ago. To realize this, think about kids. Their 
knowledge nowadays is diverse and they know much more than what their parents 
knew at the same age. Gifted children, for example, have very superior 
collection channels. They can collect a lot of information at any given time.</p><p>
Unfortunately, not long after, the child will have loads of information without 
the time to process and the &quot;clerk&quot; in the &quot;office&quot; will scream, &quot;That's it. Too 
much input. I can't handle this any more,&quot; and the child will feel overload and 
pressure. A simple thing like walking in the street stimulates a lot of incoming 
mail. The colors, the faces, the conversation of the couple you've just seen, 
the traffic jam and the smell and taste of the apples you bought in the 
supermarket. All this input is processed and stored for later use. When you are 
absorbing all this, seemingly without an effort, you brain is working overtime 
to process and you might feel stressed without being able to pinpoint the 
reason.</p><p>
A lot has been said about the ways to regulate this overload. Stress management 
actually tackles this from different angles. One way to handle stress is to try 
to divert our attention from the thing we consider the problem, where in fact we 
do not have any idea which information is sorted while we are asleep. The clerk 
processes the information as he sees fit without us having the conscious ability 
to control it. An example of diverting the attention for the supposedly a stress 
source, is the attempt to divert kids' attention from academic stimulants and 
encourage them to move into sports, art or music. This attempt only oils their 
superior machine and, instead of filtering out information, they open new 
channels of input as if the clerk now opened new doors to his office.</p><p>
Another method to overcome stress is to avoid dealing with some of the issues. 
Some people prefer the ostrich approach but are not aware of the fact that the 
office is open to the public as long as they are awake. Every minute you are not 
asleep, your office is receiving input. Sleep is just the way your clerk is 
working quietly with no disturbance. Has it happened to you that you wanted to 
stay at work after hours, when no one was around, so you can do the job without 
disturbance.</p><p>
Meditation is one of the best ways to regulate the incoming flow of information. 
In our model, meditation is like hanging a sign on the door, which says, &quot;Away 
from the office. Back in 20 minutes.&quot; During this time, we allow our clerk to 
file the information without letting any new information to come in. Meditation 
research shows that it's being neither asleep nor awake. It is a state between 
the two, in which the brain is very calm, yet very sharp.</p><p>
My first encounter with meditation was when my inspiring sister, 16 years old at 
the time, went to study Transcendental Meditation. I remember her taking time 
off, closing her eyes and sitting still for a while. She looked a bit 
ridiculous, but she was brilliant at every thing she did.</p><p>
My first meditation experience happened when Gal and I went to study all kinds 
of meditation - affirmation, light, sound, eating, dancing, walking, mantra and 
visualization. It was fun! I remember coming back home dead tired from 
meditation class, remembering that our instructor said, &quot;Your body knows exactly 
what it needs. Listen to it. You probably need to sleep.&quot;</p><p>
Some time afterwards, I was working in Texas with a group of 2-year-old toddlers 
that used to wreak havoc during sleep time, so the centre had to reorganize the 
place and bring 10 adults to put them to sleep. The grownups sat there tapping 
the kids' backs and patting their heads for an hour and a half, until the last 
one fell asleep. In our staff meeting, I suggested to introduce visualization. 
Familiar? &quot;Close your eyes and imagine you are on a soft cloud, like cotton.&quot; We 
decided to try it for a month and reassess. On the first day, the last staff 
member left after 45 minutes. On the third day, they left after 10 minutes. The 
kids were still fully awake, relaxed, but with their eyes closed. At that time, 
we introduced soft meditation music in the background for an hour and a half. 
After a successful week, we felt we were ready to hand control over to the kids 
(remember, they were only two years old). We put the music on, &quot;floated&quot; for 3 
minutes on our soft cotton cloud and then we asked them to take a deep breath 
and count one, two, three, one two, three. This way, within two weeks, we had 15 
meditating toddlers, relaxed and saving the expensive resources of 10 extra 
staff members. You can imagine how happy the centre management, the parents and 
the teachers were.</p><p>
When we moved to Melbourne, Gal ( my husband) and I registered for a 
Transcendental Meditation course. Our instructor suggested we bring the kids 
along. It sounded funny, because they were only 4 and 10 years old. I remember 
her asking us what kind of improvements we would like to see in the kids. We 
looked at each other, not knowing what to answer. They were perfect kids - 
friendly, flexible, curious, smart, loving and understanding. We went there 
every evening for a week, watched some videos and learned to meditate. After 4 
days, Gal got really sick, so Marg, our instructor, gave him 3 tea bags and told 
him to drink them during the day. She told him his body was adjusting. Like 
magic, he got up the day after, healthy and alert. About a month later, our 
perfect little son started drumming on everything. We had to look all around 
town to find someone who was willing to teach percussions to a 4-year-old. Ivan, 
bless his soul, taught him only because he himself started learning at the age 
of 4. After 4 weeks, Tsoof was so advanced that we had to send Gal with him, so 
he could help him at home with his practice. Within a year, he had 4 different 
drum teachers teaching him different styles and he started playing with adults, 
because there wasn't any children group at his level. We believe the meditation 
was the main reason for this.</p><p>
So now in our house, every health issue is solved in this order:</p><p>
1. Drink plenty of water </p><p>
2. Take vitamin C </p><p>
3. Meditate </p><p>
4. Sleep </p><p>
And you know what? This works for most things.</p><p>
In Transcendental Meditation, people meditate with a mantra. Children until the 
age of 10 can meditate for 5 minutes with their eyes open any time they wish. 
From the age of 10, they start meditating for the number of minutes equal to 
their age, until they turn 20. They just hang up the sign &quot;I'm on break. Back in 
10 minutes,&quot; twice a day. Every meditation session is considered equivalent to 
two hours of sleep and there you have it - people full of energy and focused who 
efficiently use another 4 hours of collecting information. Six years after our 
kids started meditating, we can tell by their behavior whether they hanged the 
&quot;on break&quot; sign this week or not. Meditation does not prevent the information 
from entering. It only regulates the incoming flow to allow more information to 
come in.</p><p>
In a world full of information, a world of many words, many people, loads of 
feelings, lots of noise and visions, the name of the game is quiet.</p><p>
In coaching, we encourage our clients to meditate, because it helps them regulate 
their feelings, their relations, their health, their finances and their work.</p><p>
Many people are afraid they do not do it well because they still think of things 
while meditating. Remember, the goal in meditation is not to clear the brain from 
thought but to prevent new input from entering your office. Thinking during 
meditation is natural. In time, you feel much more relaxed, focused, energetic 
and happy.</p><p>
If two hundred years ago all we wanted was more knowledge, then today our best 
asset is a sign, which says on one side &quot;on break&quot; to allow cleaning the head 
and on its other side, for when we've restored our energy, &quot;open to public!&quot;</p><p>
Be happy!</p><p>
