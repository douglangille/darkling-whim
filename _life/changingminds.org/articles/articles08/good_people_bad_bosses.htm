When Good People Become Bad Bosses</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Thejendra BS</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As soon as the word bad boss is mentioned most people start imagining 
pictures of a wicked person, a crook, a tyrant, a scheming backstabbing 
individual, a selfish ogre, etc. And typical textbook definitions of a bad boss 
is one who screams, threatens, intimidates, grabs credit, fires people, 
throttles people&#8217;s necks and so on. While this could be true in some cases, it 
is not so in a large percentage of cases. Actually it is not necessary to be a 
wicked person at all to be called a bad boss. Ironically, a good natured or 
normal person can also fall under the category of a bad boss without exhibiting 
the standard boorish behaviors. Here are a few common mistakes good people do to 
slowly transform themselves into bad bosses. </p>
<p><b>Lack of Knowledge</b>: A good person can become a manager of a department 
for various reasons, but may have no knowledge necessary to run the department. 
Often many employees get promoted to stratospheric levels too fast, but without 
the required knowledge, maturity or skills to run a bunch of diverse 
departments. And this is unavoidable in many cases as managers often have to 
swim in un-chartered waters in today&#8217;s chaotic business world. However, this can 
become a catastrophe not only for the manager but to all his peers and team 
members who look towards them for guidance, help or coaching. If managers lack 
the required knowledge and advisory skills to coach, mentor and supervise their 
department they can agitate their team members to death. In addition to 
stressing their team members daily, managers will stress themselves more as they 
will be unable to lead effectively. For example, a good person can be a car 
service supervisor, but can never effectively manage his mechanics if he himself 
does not have prior experience in servicing a car, or at least a generous dose 
of the practical hardships of it. His lack of knowledge can often lead to 
conflicts as he may make unrealistic demands on his mechanics, commit to 
impractical requests by customers, overload his mechanics, etc. Soon it will 
become a ego conflict between the &quot;Knowledgeable and the Clueless.&quot; </p>
<p><b>Avoiding learning</b>: It is understandable that a manager cannot be 
expected to have an accurate knowledge from day one. To gain knowledge one must 
get into deep water to understand the nitty-gritties of a new department's work, 
irrespective of their earlier experience. And no matter which department you 
manage there will be some amount of new learning every day to keep abreast of 
latest trends and happenings related to that particular industry. But too many 
managers avoid doing this and don't make any effort to learn the work hands on, 
or at least an essential percentage of it. They never bother to understand the 
&quot;Nuts and bolts&quot; or roll up their sleeves to get involved. Instead they run 
their departments from a high level by viewing the world through status reports, 
metrics, statistical gymnastics, asking tough questions, etc., and soon become 
an object of ridicule. Very soon this will lead to problems like inaccurate 
estimation, procrastination, unable to take independent decisions, workload 
issues, staff shortages, endless meetings, email wars, improper budgeting, and 
various daily conflicts. By refusing to learn or get involved they distance 
themselves from understanding any practical issues and difficulties of a 
department. Instead of being in a position of confidently saying, &#8220;Let me show 
you how or this is how you do it,&#8221; they will start covering their lack of 
knowledge through devious means as they become insecure and incompetent. 
Obviously that means entering into dirty waters like indulging in cheap 
politics, surround themselves with yes men, shoot the messenger and find 
scapegoats. </p>
<p><b>Unable to shield their team</b>: Often for many managers maintaining the 
status of a good and diplomatic person who will not antagonize customers and 
clients becomes more important than being right. So they may not be able to 
shield their team from hostile situations, unfair accusations or demands. They 
will start saying yes to every demand and put their team members in trouble or 
excessive workloads. Also they cannot take the heat for their team when 
required. Very soon team members will stop going to them for help like a certain 
Jeff Rich, the CEO of ACS says, &quot;I think the day that your people stop bringing 
their problems to you is the day you stop leading. They've either concluded that 
you don't care about their problems or that you cannot help them. And leaders 
have to be in a position to help.&#8221; For example, continuing the example of a 
mechanic, he will often not be able to shield his mechanics from aggressive and 
impatient customers who pressurize them with unreasonable demands, invent faults 
or expect unrealistic services. </p>
<p><b>Distorted view</b>: Customers and clients don't appreciate a plain 
exhibition of good nature. Just because a person is good, customers will not 
take things easily or dilute their demands. They need value for their money, 
solutions, answers, guidance, etc., for their problems. A good nature and lots 
of smiles cannot be used as a shield for delivering bad results. And if a person 
cannot provide that, he or she automatically becomes a bad manager. For example, 
will you go to a doctor who is very friendly, but is unable to diagnose your 
fever or prescribe the right medicines? Will junior surgeons depend on a 
friendly senior surgeon who cannot teach or oversee complicated and delicate 
surgeries? Would you go to a lawyer who talks well, but gives you bad legal 
advice? Would you go to or recommend a tax consultant who talks well, but can&#8217;t 
give you proper tax advice? Similarly a good natured person who is unable to 
help customers, clients and team members can get into trouble by being branded 
as a bad manager as their credibility will take a nosedive. </p>
<p>Finally we can conclude this article with a quote from Thomas Arnold, &#8220;Real 
knowledge, like everything else of value, is not to be obtained easily. It must 
be worked for, studied for, thought for, and, more than all must be prayed for.&#8221;
