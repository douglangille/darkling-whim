<h1>The Sales Person's First Day</h1>

The Sales Person's First Day</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Lee B. Salz</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies think that once the sales person agrees to join their company that 
the goal has been accomplished. The truth is that this is only one more step of 
the process and there is still much work to be done. </p>
<p>It's a great day at Newman Industries today! For the last month, they have 
been actively recruiting a hot candidate to join their sales team. Today, Steven 
Harmon agreed to join them. They see him as a true rainmaker. The recruiter and 
sales manager share high-fives. Mission accomplished! Spike the ball in the end 
zone. The job is done! The competition was fierce for Steven, but Newman 
Industries won. </p>
<p>While Newman Industries was celebrating, Steven resigned his position with 
his present employer and enjoyed a celebratory dinner with his wife. That night, 
Steven lay in bed wondering if he made the right decision. He came to terms with 
his decision and looks forward to his first day at the company. </p>
<p>It's 8:28am when Steven arrives for his first day at Newman Industries. He is 
excited while also apprehensive. When Steven walks into the office and 
introduces himself to the receptionist, he is surprised to hear, &quot;Oh, I didn't 
know we had a new person starting today. Who did you say you were here to see?&quot; 
Steven brushes this off as it is not completely foreign for the receptionist not 
to be notified about a new employee joining a company. </p>
<p>The receptionist calls around and tells Steven that he is in the right place, 
but his manager Jamie has not arrived yet. Steven sits in the lobby as person 
after person walks by without saying a word. </p>
<p>Finally, at 9:10am, Jamie walks in carrying a Starbucks coffee. She greets 
Steven in the lobby and takes him to his cubicle. Steven is surprised by what he 
sees. The cubicle looks like it belongs to someone else. Jamie explains that 
they had a sales person leave the company the other day and that they had not 
had a chance to remove his stuff. &quot;I have an idea,&quot; sputters Jamie, &quot;Since I 
have a meeting to run to, why don't you get rid of this stuff and then we can 
get together at 10am. Here is a garbage can. Thanks.&quot; </p>
<p>Steven agrees, but is also a little miffed. &quot;I signed up to sell, not provide 
janitorial services,&quot; he thinks. While cleaning out the desk, he finds a 
farewell card in the top drawer that is signed by all of the Newman employees. 
He thinks it is thoughtful that they recognized this employee as he left the 
company. </p>
<p>It's 10:30am when Jamie returns to Steven. She notices that there isn't a 
computer set-up for Steven in the cubicle. She calls the IT department to see 
where it is. She hangs up the phone and looks annoyed. She turns to Steven and 
tells him that HR forgot to notify the IT department. &quot;They won't have your 
computer ready for a couple of days.&quot; </p>
<p>She turns to Steven and says, &quot;I have another meeting to run to, but let's 
have lunch. Here is a bunch of stuff to read for now.&quot; Jamie produces a one foot 
high pile of wrinkled papers and says, &quot;That should get you started.&quot; </p>
<p>Lunch time comes and Jamie hurriedly comes by the cubicle and asks Steven how 
he is doing. She then proceeds to apologize, but tells him that she cannot go to 
lunch. She explains that she got called into another meeting. She suggests that 
Steven go out and get lunch on his own. &quot;We can get together at 1pm,&quot; says 
Jamie. &quot;By the way Steven, can you grab a burger for me too?&quot;I'll pay you when 
you get back to the office.&quot; </p>
<p>Steven leaves for lunch and is starting to question his decision to join 
Newman. He thinks back to the interview process and how attentive the team was 
with him. He remembers how aggressively they recruited him to join their team. 
He thinks about how warm and welcoming the management group was in their pursuit 
of him. Today, he feels like a third wheel on a date. </p>
<p>Steven comes back to the office with Jamie's burger. It's now 1pm and Steven 
is hoping that Jamie has some time for him. Jamie comes by Steven's cubicle and 
thanks him for the burger. She asks Steven to come by her office at 2pm so they 
can talk about his territory. Steven sits in his cubicle and flips through the 
pile of papers left for him. All the while, employees walk past his cubicle 
without ever saying a word. </p>
<p>When 2pm comes, Steven goes to Jamie's office. Jamie explains that the sales 
team is in a bit of a transition and the compensation plan is changing. Thus, 
there is no compensation plan to share with Steven that day. The territory is 
also in flux, but that should be resolved in the next two weeks. After chatting 
with Jamie for about a half hour, Steven returns to his cubicle. The rest of his 
day is more of the same and at 5pm he heads for home. </p>
<p>Steven's wife asks about his first day. Steven says, &quot;I'm really happy that I 
didn't pull my resume off the job boards or tell the recruiters that I was off 
the market because I don't know if this is going to work out. We'll have to 
see.&quot; </p>
<p>The truth is that Newman Industries is really a fine company. They just made 
a very common mistake when hiring sales people. They worked so hard to recruit 
Steven that they celebrated prematurely. The company thought that they had 
Steven when he accepted the offer. That was their error. They failed to 
recognize that they had only completed the next step of the process. What is 
missing is a program to ensure the impression made in the recruiting and 
interview process is continued when the person arrives on their first day. Many 
of you reading this probably think I made up that story about Steven. The truth 
is that this story is an amalgam of the many horror stories that I have heard 
over the years from sales people. </p>
<p>Putting together a new hire welcoming program isn't overly difficult to do. 
However, it takes commitment on the part of the entire management team to ensure 
it is followed. Think back to the story. Steven found a card that was given to 
the employee on the way out. How about a welcome card for Steven that is placed 
in his clean cubicle that has everything he needs to do his job? Office 
supplies, new hire paperwork, a PC, a who's who list, a phone that is ready for 
use, etc. Again, it's not hard to do this, but requires some thought. </p>
<p>Who will take ownership for this in your company? You? Why not you? Grab the 
ball and run with it! Consider how much money was spent to recruit Steven into 
Newman Industries. Now think about those dollars evaporating after Steven 
doesn't return after his first day. Need ideas on how to put together a new hire 
welcoming program? Send me an email for my tip sheet. </p>
