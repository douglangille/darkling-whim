Who Else Wants Success By Choosing What They Want In Life</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Andrew Rondeau</i> </p>
<p class="quote"><i>Do you want success?....than make a choice.</i> </p>
<p>You can choose success. Do you believe this? If you do not then you have 
chosen (yes chosen) a different route and success will not be a prominent 
feature! Success is about choosing what you want in life and taking the 
necessary steps to achieve that goal. Success is not stopping until you get 
there! </p>
<p>Read the last two sentences again. Easy to say but how do you get there? What 
are the choices made by the successful? What are they doing differently from 
everyone else? </p>
<p>Choose to remove whatever is holding you back. Has something happened in the 
past to affect your self-esteem? Do you immediately have negative thoughts as 
soon as money and success come to mind? If you are not choosing success then it 
is likely that something is blocking your ability to change and follow a new 
path. To remove the block you must have focus. To have focus you must first have 
an all-consuming dream of where you want to be. Only when you have defined that 
dream can you start to focus on it. Focus so intently that everything you do is 
done with your dream in mind. Only then can you move toward that dream. </p>
<p>Choose to live your success. Live your life as if you were successful, as if 
you had already achieved the goal that you are focusing on. When you are at 
work, visualise what your workplace will be like when you have reached your 
goal, and place yourself there. Sit at your desk as if you were running the 
multimillion-dollar business that you are focusing on. When you get into your 
car, visualise what your dream car will be like and see yourself sitting in it. 
Visualise yourself driving away from your dream house. When you are in your home 
- look around it and see your new surroundings. Get inside the feeling - really 
be there. </p>
<p>The more you do this, the more your subconscious will think that you are 
successful and move you towards these things. Live your success expecting to 
realise it. Living it now is a practice run for when it comes to you. After all, 
you want to be prepared, don't you? </p>
<p>Choose to believe in your success. What your conscious mind believes, your 
subconscious strives to achieve. Look around at your friends and acquaintances 
and ask yourself how many of them have unshakable belief in where they are 
going. Are they successful? Possibly not - they may be in a good job and have a 
nice life but they do not have the success factor. Perhaps you do know of 
someone with unshakable belief. They may not be successful now but they will be 
moving in the right direction. Watch that space.... </p>
<p>Belief is the catalyst, which takes the dream and turns the focus into a plan 
to get there. Never underestimate the power of belief. </p>
<p>Choose to be emotional about your success. Belief plus emotion are 
unstoppable. If you have utter belief then you will develop emotion. If you want 
something badly enough it is emotive. Maybe it is to get out of debt. If you 
have suffered the hardships of this situation you will feel everything to do 
with debt and money is charged with emotion. This is the reason behind so many 
'rags to riches' stories. Sometimes only the most devastating of emotional 
circumstances are the catalyst for change and a move toward success instead of 
away from it. </p>
<p>You can choose success. Or you can choose to stay safe and do what you do 
now. Guess what - you will still be doing the same in ten years time. The 
question is - do you want to?</p>
