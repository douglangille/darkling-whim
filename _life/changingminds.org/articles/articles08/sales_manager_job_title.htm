Sales Manager: Job Title or Specialized Skill</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Lee B. Salz</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many business executives focus their search for sales management candidates 
from within their industry. They are restricting their ability to find the right 
person for the role. </p>
<p>One of the most critical decisions a company will make is the hiring of the 
right sales manager. However, many business owners and executives make the all 
too common mistake of restricting their search to those with industry 
experience. There is a feeling that the sales manager must come from their 
industry as that is the only way they will be successful in the role. Many put 
that element of their criteria at the top of their decision list. &quot;The 
successful applicant will have 10 years experience in the widget industry.&quot; 
Hogwash! </p>
<p>The end result of this approach is that companies hire the industry retreads. 
Perhaps, employers think that this person will bring along valuable competitive 
secrets, maybe even some clients. While that may occasionally happen, this 
approach negatively impacts the company. They may as well hang a sign outside 
that says, &quot;No new ideas permitted&quot; because that is what you get when you focus 
your search on industry people only. What often happens is that the individual 
gets hired because they can create the illusion of brilliance by using industry 
jargon to blind the interviewer. &quot;Eureka! We've found our sales manager! She is 
very strategic!&quot; </p>
<p>Every company thinks they are in an industry that is so unique and has so 
many nuances that the hire must have industry background. This is a scary 
approach! If that's the feeling in the company, there is a much bigger issue 
that they face. How will they scale? If they always limit the search to those 
within the industry, what do they do when they run out of candidates? The fact 
is that most industry information can be taught. The company needs to get over 
their hubris thinking that their industry is so special that it takes an 
industry veteran to be successful. Product knowledge is not the main driver in a 
successful sales person, nor is it the primary one for the successful sales 
manager. Consider this, CEOs bounce from Fortune 1000 company to Fortune 1000 
company based on their CEO acumen, not their industry knowledge. </p>
<p>A more prudent approach for hiring the right sales manager is to look for a 
candidate who comes to the table with the specialized skill set associated with 
a sales manager. Yes, this is a specialized skill set and, often times, is 
portable into any industry. The role of the sales manager is to both be a leader 
and a manager which is not usually skills developed in the womb. They are 
cultivated and developed through training and experience as a sales manager. 
Some of the elements that companies should be focused on when hiring the right 
sales manager include: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Recruitment</b>. Whether the company has an opening on the sales team or not, 
the best sales managers are on a never-ending quest for strong talent. As the 
prospective employer, you want to understand the candidate's process for 
screening sales candidates. How do they prime the applicant pump? Can they 
develop a profile of the ideal sales person, and prioritize it between required 
and desired attributes? What is their process for evaluating candidates against 
the profile? Ask any company why they miss their revenue targets and most will 
tell you that having unfilled slots on the team is a contributing factor. 
Recruitment is a very important arrow in the sales manager's quiver. </li>
  <li><b>Onboarding</b>. Rarely can you hire a sales person, hand them their territory, 
and send them off with a good luck kiss. At least, not if you expect them to be 
successful. Another key skill of the sales manager is their method for quickly 
assimilating the sales person into the organization. What is their strategy to 
minimize the amount of time that the new sales person is in a non-revenue 
generating capacity? What is their plan to make them productive in the least 
amount of time? How do they measure whether or not the neophyte sales person is 
going to be successful? </li>
  <li><b>Process</b>. Many companies have one superstar on their sales team, their 
rainmaker. That's not exactly a scalable model. It limits growth and creates 
exposure for the company. What happens if the rainmaker leaves? Scalable sales 
organizations are based on process. The entire team follows a specified model 
based on a defined formula. Can this candidate create this process for the 
company? What experience have they had in doing so? And, what were the results? 
  </li>
  <li><b>Metrics</b>. There's a wonderful expression about management. &quot;What gets 
measured, gets done!&quot; The wonderful aspect of sales is that there is so much 
data that can be reviewed to understand trends and make changes to the business. 
How the sales manager utilizes metrics in their approach is another element that 
is important to scrutinize as you interview the candidate. How have they used 
metrics to affect the performance of the team? What is their approach to 
scrutinize a sales pipeline or forecast? </li>
  <li><b>Compensation</b>. The beauty of sales is that the compensation plan serves as 
the sales person's job description. This can also be a curse for the company if 
the wrong behaviors are rewarded by the plan. This is another important skill 
that a strong sales manager should possess. What is their approach for 
developing the right compensation plan for the company? How do they determine 
which behaviors to reward and when/how? </li>
  <li><b>Skill development</b>. Sales is philosophy so no one ever knows everything 
about it. It's also very easy for sales people to develop bad habits. Thus, it 
is critical that the sales manager have a skill development plan for their team. 
What is their approach for developing their team members? How do they inspire 
the overachievers to continue to overachieve? How do they manage the 
underperformers and lead them to either perform or deselect from the company? 
  </li>
  <li><b>Leadership</b>. The first six items fall into a management category. However, 
the strong sales managers are also leaders. Their sales teams will run through 
walls for them. Their sales people not only want to be successful for 
themselves, but also for their manager. How does this sales management candidate 
create an environment where others are inspired to follow them and their 
teachings? Leadership skills and salesforce retention work hand-in-hand. Strong 
leaders keep their strong players on the team for the long haul. </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to cultural fit, these are the seven key elements that a company 
should use to make a decision to hire a particular sales management candidate. 
What the employer will get with this hiring approach is a strong, scalable 
organization with fresh ideas. People in your company won't be able to get away 
with the old mantra of &quot;we've just always done it that way.&quot; Don't you want to 
drive your company to grow? Expand your horizons and reap the benefits. Taking 
this approach will help your company develop long-lasting, fruitful sales 
marriages. </p>
