Stuck in a Rut? Six Ways to Jumpstart Your Life Right Now</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Guerline Jasmin</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You know how it feels to be stuck in a rut. You&#8217;re doing the same activities 
over and over, and you&#8217;re not happy. Maybe you feel bored with your life or 
burnt out on the job. Perhaps you know what would make you happy, such as a new 
career or increased responsibility at work, but making that goal a reality seems 
insurmountable and not even worth trying. So you stay in the same situation 
you&#8217;re currently in, hoping that someday something will change, but it never 
does. Face it&#8230;you&#8217;re in a rut! Being stuck in a rut is never fun. Aside from 
being bored with your situation, being in a rut also makes you more prone to 
depression and negative thinking&#8212;the two things that will keep you in your rut 
for even longer. So if you want your situation to change, you must change. 
Instead of complaining that there&#8217;s nothing you can do to make your life better, 
realize that there&#8217;s actually a lot you can do. You just have to get out there, 
take a risk, and do something. When you are not making any progress toward a 
particular goal and feel completely stuck, the key to making a big change is to 
make little changes. Use the following six guidelines to jumpstart your life out 
of a rut right now. </p>
<h2>1. Think Big&#8230;and Small </h2>
<p>You need motivation to change. Therefore, think of the 
new circumstances you want in your life. Envision the new job, the new office, 
or the new career. Now you have the motivation to actually do something. But 
don&#8217;t stop there. Once you decide what you want, you then need to make a plan to 
get there. Create a list of action steps that will move you closer to the vision 
you have for yourself. Realize that your action steps don&#8217;t have to be big or 
monumental leaps. They can be small baby steps that lead you to your goal. 
Always remember that small steps, done consistently, will get you where you want 
to go. </p>
<h2>2. Be a 100% Responsible </h2>
<p>To get unstuck, you have to be 100% responsible for 
your actions. After all, you are the only person with the power to change your 
situation. Despite what you may think, your company, the marketplace, and even 
your family do not have the power to make changes for you. You are in control of 
your life and must be responsible for making changes. Therefore, don&#8217;t complain 
about your current situation. Sure, your complaints helped you realize that you 
were dissatisfied with something, but now that you&#8217;re aware of what you want or 
don&#8217;t want in life, stop complaining. Your constant negativity will only further 
drain you and won&#8217;t change your situation. For example, if you&#8217;re experiencing a 
bad situation, such as a job loss, instead of concentrating on the job loss and 
complaining about it, embrace the change and think how you can upgrade your 
resume or whom you can contact for new job opportunities. </p>
<h2>3. Express, Don&#8217;t Repress </h2>
<p>As you work your way through your rut, don&#8217;t 
suppress your emotions. Instead, experience them fully. Going back to our 
example of a job loss, perhaps you&#8217;re very sad that you lost your job. Maybe you 
loved that job and wanted to stay with the company for the rest of your working 
career. Rather than be depressed for weeks or even months, express the emotion 
you&#8217;re feeling. If you feel you need to cry or yell out in rage, then do so. 
After you&#8217;ve let the emotion out, let it be. Don&#8217;t dwell on it forever. 
Experience the emotion and then move on. Remember, each event we experience in 
our life is a learning opportunity. Find the lesson that&#8217;s hidden in your 
current situation so you can move on. </p>
<h2>4. Take Inventory </h2>
<p>Schedule time each day to review your past successes. Many 
times when people get stuck in a rut, they forget about all the great things 
they did in the past. They are concentrating on the present, which is not so 
good right now, and they can&#8217;t figure out how they&#8217;ll get past their current 
circumstance. However, when you look back at your past successes, you start 
building your confidence and your inner strength. You are reminded of all your 
wonderful capabilities and that you can be successful again, if only work toward 
your goal. </p>
<h2>5. Expand Your Focus </h2>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to want something, whether it&#8217;s a new career, 
a promotion, or even to lose weight. The work happens when you&#8217;re making that 
want a reality. This is when you need to shift your thinking from &#8220;wanting&#8221; to 
&#8220;having.&#8221; Why is a &#8220;having mindset&#8221; so important? Because when you focus on 
something in terms of &#8220;having,&#8221; your subconscious mind will go to work 
immediately to come up with a number of ways to get the item or circumstance. 
Therefore, create a picture or scrapbook representing your successful life. Cut 
out pictures and words from magazines that represent what you want. This step is 
important, because once you create your vision on paper, it&#8217;ll be reinforced in 
your mind. You can then go through that scrapbook every day to remind yourself 
of the kind of life you want. Additionally, write down what you want seven times 
per day. When doing so, be sure to write in the present tense, as if you already 
have the circumstance. For example, you could write, &#8220;I am the best salesperson 
in the company.&#8221; Or, &#8220;I have a new 2008 Mercedes Benz.&#8221; </p>
<h2>6. Do Something </h2>
<p>Many people who are stuck in a rut reply to every suggestion 
or request with the same answer: &#8220;Well&#8230;I&#8217;ll try.&#8221; It&#8217;s time to reject that 
answer. You need to either accept, decline, or counter the suggestion. The words 
&#8220;I&#8217;ll try&#8221; are not motivating and contain the seeds of defeat. The fact is that 
trying and thinking about doing something are a waste of time and energy. To get 
out of a rut, you must do something. For example, you can take a different road 
to and from work. Take a walk during your lunch hour. Meditate fifteen minutes a 
day. Doing something, whether big or small, will revitalize your life and make 
you more attune to opportunities. Ultimately, the decision is up to you. So if 
you really want a change, do something today. No matter what the outcome is of 
your activity, you&#8217;re going to learn something. So take a step toward getting 
out of the place you don&#8217;t want to be anymore. </p>
<h2>Escape the Rut for Good </h2>
<p>Yes, there is hope for you, no matter how long you&#8217;ve 
been in your current rut. And while change can be scary, the secret is to work 
through the fear. That&#8217;s the only way you&#8217;re going to make progress and increase 
your self-confidence. So take 100% responsibility for your life today. Learn 
from the lessons you uncover, and move forward with passion. Whether your action 
step is large or small, implement it today. By doing something&#8212;anything&#8212;you 
create the needed momentum to drive yourself out of that rut and full speed into 
the life you&#8217;ve always dreamed about. </p>
