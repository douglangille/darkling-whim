<h1>Getting the Change Process right using the Human Needs Model</h1>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="../articles.htm">Guest articles</a> &gt; Getting the Change Process right using the Human Needs Model</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: John Fillingham</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
If we can understand change in the context of the human needs theory (a 
refreshing interpretation - check out Anthony Robbins&#8217; work) we can see that it 
collides with almost all the categories of human needs - <b>Certainty</b> (STABILITY, 
SECURITY) <b>Uncertainty </b>(VARIETY) <b>Connections </b>(RELATIONSHIPS) <b>Significance
</b>(SELF 
ESTEEM) <b>Growth </b>(LEARNING, HAVING DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES) <b>Contribution
</b>(GIVING 
BACK TO OTHERS, GIVING SELFLESSLY). So then, change impacts over 80% of the core 
human needs that drive our very human existence, is it any wonder we quiver to 
the knees when we hear the mighty rumble of change approaching.<h2></h2>
<h2>Engaging people and the six needs</h2>
<p></p>
How then can we manage better the change process from an implementation position 
and also from a receiving position? It would be easy to say simply &#8220;engagement&#8221; 
in the process as the simple answer to this question, but in essence this is 
only part of the answer. Involvement becomes a bedrock of successful change 
management, but that if you think it stops there, then consider this &#8211; if the 
six needs have to be met though this process and more than supported, be lifted 
to new levels, then how can simple involvement solve all the issues? Every 
aspect needs to be built successfully into the pathway, each element considered 
and from a business perspective, this becomes crucial in its successful 
implementation and value adding activities.<p></p>
<h2>Generating certainty</h2>
<p></p>
So how can this be achieved? Generating certainty is never easy &#8211; fixing crystal 
clear goals and concrete focused objectives has to be the first key part of 
these fundamental requirements. Deciding clearly laid out timetables and plans 
together, quantifying outcomes or milestones are also the foundations of 
certainty but remember - togetherness is the new value. Re-assurance and support 
resources come to the fore in this process, so create them if necessary to 
ensure there are almost independent advice mechanisms.<p></p>
Emphasising the elements of continuity are useful in being able to accurately 
relate the complete picture through the transfer process of change to your new 
vision. It helps balance up the scales of sometimes a shocking difference in 
this brave new world.<p></p>
<h2>Supporting uncertainty</h2>
<p></p>
This may seem like a strange bedfellow in the change process, but this is where 
the elements of excitement can enter stage right. Those parts yet to be defined, 
where cloud and uncertainty exist, therefore allow you to propose a version of 
interesting dilemmas. A dialogue of important shifts can then occur to alter 
this void of uncertainty towards something more secure, still with doubts and 
surprises, but with a positive spin. Together you can shape the future. Their 
future but based on focused objectives.<p></p>
We must not forget this area becomes heightened in the change process. We must 
tread carefully when managing this particular aspect of change. Even for those 
of us who love and embrace change on a regular basis, whatever the size, large 
or small, if not handled correctly, it harasses us uncontrollably and turns our 
very being upside down and inside out until resolved.<p></p>
<h2>Bolstering relationships</h2>
<p></p>
In most work environments and all other situations of course, change affects 
multiple people, therefore relationships forms a key factor in the process. 
Often forgotten, relationships and relationship dynamics creates either a 
supportive atmosphere or a potentially destructive one. So what can we do to 
support this area &#8211; acknowledge that these can be affected and ask everyone to 
be supportive to each other is the first part. <p></p>
Consider the relationship aspects and how they will be affected by the change 
process. The interaction of personalities and changes in relationship 
connections results in fundamental shifts that are almost invisible in their 
presence but enormous in their impact. So take account of new relationships to 
be built, old ones that cause problems, designing teams for maximum 
effectiveness and harmony. It is essential to build in adequate time and 
resources for these things to take place.<p></p>
<h2>Maintaining self esteem</h2>
<p></p>
The fourth area of significance, of maintaining self esteem, the need to feel 
unique that means every voice must be heard. In practical terms there must be 
vehicles present to allow this to happen. The process must be based on fairness 
principles and individuals must be treated as individuals as well as groups. 
Maintaining dignity and treating people in an adult like fashion is a key driver 
in creating respect for people during this adventure towards the future. Status 
and ego also feature in this category where change becomes a serious threat to 
the maintenance of such well crafted levels. How many times has credibility been 
lost and faith in the change process been destroyed by heavy handed approaches 
that forget the &#8220;togetherness&#8221; principle. Balance rushing to get things sorted 
with a in-depth, well thought through decision making processes.<p></p>
Involving people in the process, giving them responsibility for certain aspects 
of the methodology could help in the engagement factor that increases support 
and moves doubters from a position of attack to defence of the change.<p></p>
<h2>Opportunities for growth</h2>
<p></p>
Is it possible people can learn something through this process? Yes of course, 
they can learn something about themselves but more importantly by being involved 
and even given responsibility for tasks that gives them new confidence and 
prominence. By doing things differently, or having to do them differently, we 
learn, it&#8217;s as simple as that. However the benefits are often forgotten: new 
skills, new knowledge, new confidence &#8211; a growth opportunity for sure.<p></p>
<h2>Selfless contribution</h2>
<p></p>
An interesting concept in the change process. Although considered by some not a 
high impact factor, this can be the time for a display of unbridled caring and 
support for those who may find the greatest difficulty. So going out of your way 
to help and step in where necessary to support those individuals going through a 
tough time is not only good for you but good for them. For those for whom this 
comes naturally, they can act as ideal support resources for those who need it.
</p>
<p>For those who regularly give to the organisation over and above the call of 
duty, the change process may unwittingly wipe out their positivity. Their 
support, potentially outside of the recognition boundaries of your processes, 
can be quashed in an instant and seen as betrayal in a situation not unlike a 
war for survival. Be aware and ready to utilise this usually unwavering tower of 
strength.<p></p>
The BIG Gaps in the process of change management<p></p>
As we have travelled though the journey of the human needs model, we can see 
some clear gaps in the management of the change process highlighted by our own 
previous experiences we have mostly likely to have encountered. From a simple 
lack of involvement to the missed impact of relationships to the fallen 
opportunity to say what isn&#8217;t changing means the change process continues to get 
a raw deal in publicity terms&#8230;can you help it change? Build those 6 needs into 
all your change processes. </p>
