Can Becoming a &#8220;Thoughtleader&#8221; Give You an Edge as a CEO?</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Ken Lizotte</i></p>
<p align="center" class="quote"><i>Can Becoming a &#8220;Thoughtleader&#8221; Give You an Edge as a CEO? Attempts to 
Quantify Its ROI </i>Say YES </p>
<p>Have you ever thought about or noticed another CEO utilizing &#8220;thoughtleading&#8221; 
as a business development strategy? Positioning yourself and your firm as 
leading-edge thinkers in your field involves publishing articles and books, 
speaking regularly to professional groups, getting yourself noticed by the media 
and surveying your target market in order to produce research data that only you 
possess. </p>
<p>If that sounds like fun, or simply a potentially advantageous way to 
distinguish your firm&#8217;s services, one major hurdle to choosing to implement such 
a novel strategy might be the question of ROI, specifically: Does evidence exist 
that a thoughtleading strategy really will generate new business growth? Is 
there any way to accurately measure this? Can a &#8220;thoughtleading 
Return-on-Investment (ROI)&#8221; be quantified? More importantly, can it pay 
dividends for YOU as a CEO? </p>
<p>Happily, the answer to all four questions is &#8220;yes.&#8221; Studies indicate that a 
quantifiable ROI can in fact be discerned, and, just as happily, indications are 
that results will be overwhelmingly affirmative. Getting to the heart of the 
issue, however, first requires an understanding that age-old ways of measuring 
ROI may not always apply here. That&#8217;s because a new equation in our economy, one 
that&#8217;s mistier than traditional bottom-line measurements, demands alternative 
methods of measurement. This new equation is the economic asset of &#8220;intellectual 
capital&#8221; (or IC). </p>
<p>The concrete ROI metric standard until now has always been based on 
&#8220;I-can-see-it-with-my-own-eyes.&#8221; This still applies to material goods of course 
but IC&#8217;s decidedly non-Industrial Age elements can be harder to fathom. Mary 
Adams, Managing, Principal of Trek Consulting LLC (<a href="http://www.trekconsulting.com/">http://www.trekconsulting.com/</a>), 
specialists in the developing study of IC as an asset that can be measured, 
explains it this way: </p>
<p>&#8220;Can you imagine a merchant without an inventory report, having to sell 
product without knowing the quantity or price of goods he owns? Yet this is the 
position that most corporate leaders are in today. They lack basic consolidated 
information about their most important resources: Do we have the right people, 
network, and knowledge to meet our goals? Are we positioned for continued 
innovation? Where are we at risk?&#8221; </p>
<p>Such relatively &#8220;soft&#8221; questions leave the interpretation of data and 
resulting ROI conclusions in the hands (and minds) of analysts to a greater 
degree than has been true of traditional ROI measurement with its clear numbers 
and black-and-white company balance sheet. As one example, Kennedy Information, 
the nation&#8217;s premiere management consulting think tank, which regularly conducts 
surveys of management consulting compensation, has found that firms and 
individual consultants at the topmost point of the compensation chart are paid 
way, way better than the remaining 99% below. When asked how the top 1% manage 
this, the response is crisp and clear: &#8220;Oh, those highest revenue-producers are 
the ones who regularly publish articles and books, do speaking engagements, and 
connect with the media,&#8221; the Kennedy people explain. &#8220;They are the 
thoughtleaders.&#8221; </p>
<p>Another recent study has also correlated increased revenue with publishing, 
speaking, media and other individual thoughtleading actions, adding that 
thoughtleading&#8217;s ROI will be measurably high when thoughtleading actions are 
integrated with a firm&#8217;s more traditional marketing and sales activities. 
Article-publishing ROI, for example, incorporated in the marketing and selling 
pipeline, can easily be measured by asking prospects if the firm&#8217;s published 
articles had played any part either in their initial decision to approach the 
company or in their ultimate decision to do business with the company. One 
professional services firm can testify to this personally. </p>
<p>&#8220;We always email prospects a PDF or two of our published articles early in 
the sales process,&#8221; says the firm&#8217;s president. &#8220;We want our prospects to see a 
relevant published article of ours so they will glance at it and be impressed. 
&#8216;Wow, this looks pretty cool&#8217; may be all they say, then we move on. But that&#8217;s 
sufficient to stamp my firm as something more than some run-of-the-mill 
consultancy, which is what they may be thinking.&#8221; </p>
<p>Some studies have even produced clear and definitive measurements sufficient 
to satisfy even the most old school quantifiability standards. One survey of law 
firms by Levick Strategic Communications and PR Newswire surveyed 200 firms that 
had gotten themselves mentioned consistently in the legal media. Their survey 
found that the 25 firms on its list with the highest revenues were also those 
with an average increase of nearly 20% in overall media presence over the 
previous two years. Firms ranked below these 25 in terms of income, however, 
reported a mere 1% increase in media presence. </p>
<p>Is there also anecdotal evidence that thoughtleading produces a measurable 
ROI? You bet. Former top executive recruiter Jim Masciarelli, now founder and 
CEO of PowerSkills Solutions, a &#8220;relationship capital&#8221; consulting firm, recalls 
one time when his book PowerSkills: Building Top-Level Relationships for 
Bottom-Line Results clearly led directly to a piece of business that he 
certainly would not have landed on his own: </p>
<p>&#8220;A partner of a top venture capital firm who knew me from my past career as a 
retained executive search consultant called me up after receiving an 
announcement of my book PowerSkills, which details a system I created for 
building profitable business relationships. He said, &#8216;I understand you&#8217;re now 
doing advisory and alignment work with CEOs and executive teams. We could really 
use your help!&#8217; </p>
<p>&#8220;Their portfolio company had just acquired a major Internet company in a 22- 
billion dollar stock deal,&#8221; Jim recalls, &#8220;but the CEO did not yet have a plan to 
integrate these companies. The mere announcement of my book (and, with it, my 
new practice) repositioned me as an expert in his mind in this new line of work 
I was now pursing. As a result, I got the introduction to the CEO and ultimately 
the assignment as well.&#8221; </p>
<p>Are you wondering if all this means that publishing an article or a book, or 
engaging in other thoughtleading actions such as public speaking, media and 
research, will automatically yield you new business and/or drive your incomes 
levels up above that of your competitors? Well, there are no guarantees in life, 
so no one can say for sure. But it is clear from all the data and anecdotal 
evidence that the likelihood is there. Since most CEOs will ignore it, a 
thoughtleading business development strategy could be the smartest decision you 
and your firm could make. There are just so very many facts, figures, studies, 
stories and personal experiences to back you up. </p>
