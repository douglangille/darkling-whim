Memory</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Margaret Francis</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Memory is an important aspect of human life. With out memory there is no 
meaning in life. Memory is a product of organized and conscious effort on the 
part of each individual, fired by the need to know and remember or succeed in 
life. Through practice and general awareness of factors, which leads to better 
memory. The ability to memorize events are the process of registering the event 
in the parts of the brain, when the event happens or we experience any thing at 
the time of the event. If we want to remember the previous events, or any 
related event we saw, then the previous events will automatically come to our 
mind and able to relate it with the present one. Memory depends upon person&#8217;s 
interest and attention. It also depends on how we practice. Crack and Lockhart 
(1972) argued that rehearsal alone is not sufficient for long-term memory, which 
is not very deep. They have believed that the memory is the depth processing in 
which need to identify how long the event is to memorize, long term or 
short-term period. </p>
<p><i><b>Interest: </b></i>Memory always depends upon the interest of the person 
towards the event or the subject. If we have interest we will be more attentive 
and able to capture the event as a whole and it is easy to remember. We remember 
that which evoke our curiosity or that which touches us deeply. If we are 
interested in a particular subject, we are less likely to forget it. To improve 
memory, we need to cultivate interest in the subject, which we want to remember. 
The interested aspects we will store in our memory by relating it with our 
previous experience. So it is easy to remember, since we have keen interest in 
that particular subject. Eysenck(1972) shows that the more distinctive or 
unusual information is, the better it is remembered. Eysenck(1985) argued that 
simply thinking of memory in terms of levels of processing on their own , could 
not account for the variability in how information was remembered, although it 
might account for the same. He also pointed out the important factors requires 
the person to memorize effectively. The factors are always depends on the nature 
of the task, type of material which is to be remembered, the person&#8217;s own 
knowledge of the idea concerned, and the way that memory performance is tested.
</p>
<p><i><b>Attention: </b></i>If we really have interest in any subject, we will 
pay attention to details. We will be able to capture the related areas. We try 
to read and hear more. The visual effect also very helpful to remember the 
things. Apart from this we try to improve your observation skill. </p>
<p><i><b>Comprehension: </b></i>Try to analyze and understand more on what you 
are learning. Clear your doubts and seek clarification. Take adequate points or 
make mental notes, until you are certain that you understand fully and what is 
to be remember. Try to correlate with previous experience or the familiar items, 
which is very easy for you to remember. </p>
<p><i><b>Repetition: </b></i>Repetition of the thing, which you want to 
remember, is very effective. Re-read, write, draw related pictures, memorize 
until the subject is firmly fixed in your mind. More repetitions ensure better 
chance of remembrance. </p>
<p><i><b>Review: </b></i>Review what is remembered &#8211;It is resurfacing that which 
has been pushed back by the new layers of knowledge. Review will help us to </p>
<p><i><b>Application: </b></i>Apply and practice what you have learned. If you 
are learning a language and have learned new words, start using them in your 
conversation. We can learn many things by doing. Also the learned thing we are 
applying into our practical life, it will be easier for as to remember. </p>
<p><i><b>Recall: </b></i>Try to remember what you have experienced in the past. 
In recall, you really more on your mind and your ability to think, visualize and 
reconstruct mentally what you want to remember. Morris, Bransford and franks 
(1977) gave evidence against the levels of processing. They said that it is 
possible that the better recall of meaningful materials is due to the way the 
participants memories were tested. Kristinet.al, in their study of &#8220;short-term 
memory recall of pictures, words, and pictures and words presented together&#8221; 
shows that pictures and words together were better remembered than words alone, 
but pictures and words together were not significantly better than pictures 
alone. </p>
<p><b><i>Association: </i></b>Try to associate new knowledge with the old 
knowledge, which is already stored in your mind. Human knowledge is relative; we 
remember things in association with other things. We need to associate the new 
things with the familiar topics. </p>
<p><i><b>Imagination: </b></i>Create an image map of the thing which you want to 
remember or visualize the whole thing mentally develop interesting associations, 
which will enable you to remember the subject more efficiently and for longer 
periods. </p>
<p><b>Other Factors<i> </i></b></p>
<p><i><b>Physical health: </b></i>Good health is the basis for good memory. 
Mental Health: An open mind, a certain degree of humility, willingness to learn, 
to be corrected, enhance your ability to learn and comprehend and thereby your 
ability to remember. Positive attitude and peaceful mind will capture more and 
help as to improve our memory. Organize: Use your mind efficiently and for the 
higher purpose of making yourself more effective and efficient in what ever you 
do. Store only useful information, that which helps you achieve your goals. </p>
<p><i><b>Eye Movements: </b></i>A study conducted by Melinda Wenner (2007) 
suggested moving your eye improve memory. Horizontal eye movements are thought 
to cause the two hemispheres of the brain to interact more than one another, and 
communication between brain hemispheres is important for retrieving certain 
types of memories. Previous studies shows that horizontal eye movement improves 
the capacity of the people to recall specific words than just seen. Researchers 
found that the people who performed the horizontal eye movements correctly 
remembered, on average more than 10 percent more words. Stephan Christman in 
another study reveals that horizontal eye movement improves recall memory. 
Christman said that leftward eye movements activates the right brain hemisphere 
and that right ward movements activate the left hemisphere. He thought that 
horizontal eye movements might, improve memory by helping the hemisphere 
interact. </p>
<p><i><b>Sleep: </b></i>Strengthen memories and Makes them resistant to 
interfering information. Science daily (2006) pointed out that researchers have 
uncovered new evidence that sleep improves the brain&#8217;s ability to remember 
information. The findings demonstrated that memories of recent events or the 
learned word are improved if sleep intervenes between learning and testing and 
that this benefit is most pronounced when memory is challenged by competing 
information.The findings are reported in July 12th issue of current Biology by 
Jeffrey Ellenbogen of Harward Medical School and his collegues.this is the first 
study to show that sleep protects memories from interference. Food habit &amp; 
Memory One twenty year Harvard Medical school study of more than 13,000 women 
showed that the participants who ate relatively high amounts of vegetables over 
the years had less age- related decline in memory. Cruiciferous vegetables like 
Broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower etc.and leafy green vegetables had the biggest 
effect. A study conducted by Rush University medical center in Chicago followed 
more than 3,000 men and women for six years to see how diet affected memory. 
They found that people who ate fish at least once a week had a 10 percent slower 
decline. A long term health study has shown that vitamin E and Vitamin C 
supplements have a &#8220;significant protective effect &#8220; against memory problems and 
loss of mental alertness, according to Cornell University medical publication. 
Steps to improve your memory 1. Take in information 2. About five minutes later 
undisturbed, go over the main points of what you are trying to remember. That 
should only take you a minute or two. 3. An hour later do the same thing 4. 
Three hours later, do it again and go back over the information a minute or two. 
5. Six hours later, do the same thing. Then that night before you go to sleep, 
review the material one last time. 6. Repeat that tree times a day for the 
second and third days. Now you have that information for a long time. </p>
