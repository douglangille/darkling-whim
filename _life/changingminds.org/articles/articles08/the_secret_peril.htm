The Secret Peril That Causes Sales to be Lost</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Lee B. Salz</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="quote"><i>One of the biggest mirages in sales is the proverbial rubber stamp. Sales 
people believe that they have won the business, but have left a deal-killer in 
play. </i> </p>
<p>It's September, also known as back to school time. My neighbors and I escort 
our children to the bus stop for the first day of the new school year. However, 
we're puzzled about the location of the bus stop. It isn't in the same place 
that it was in prior years. Instead of the children walking down the street, 
just a few houses, they now had to cross two, very active streets to get to the 
bus stop. </p>
<p>Vigilant, we parents made calls to get the stop moved back to where it was 
before. It seemed to be a fairly easy process. We called the administrator who 
coordinates the bus stops and he easily acquiesced. The supervisor of the bus 
drivers visited the bus stop and agreed with us about the safety concern. The 
administrator told us that the paperwork just needed to get signed by his boss, 
but to let the driver know the decision was made to move the bus stop back to 
the old location. Victory was ours. Or was it? We left someone out of the 
process and what occurred next will sound painfully familiar to any sales person 
who works in a complex, multi-buyer, sale. </p>
<p>After the conversation with the supervisor and administrator, we went to what 
we thought was the new, old bus stop. The bus turned down our street, we gave 
our kids a farewell kiss, and awaited their boarding of the bus. <i>Here comes the 
bus. There goes the bus</i>. The bus driver drove past us as if we weren't even 
there. Needless to say, we were furious and got on the horn. All roads led to 
Jack (name changed) who is the ultimate decision-maker on bus stops. He had not 
been consulted on any of these discussions or decisions and was blind-sided by 
this situation. &quot;I see no reason to change the stop from where <u>I assigned it</u>, he 
barked.&quot; We immediately knew this was going to be problematic. With the urging 
of the school and the parents, he agreed to &quot;re-assess&quot; the bus stop. </p>
<p>Following his re-assessment, he called each of the parents to inform them of 
<u>his</u> decision. &quot;Well, I don't think the bus stop is unsafe, but I'm going to move 
it.&quot; Don't think for one second that he used this opportunity to say that the 
parents' solution was better than his. Instead, he didn't move the stop to the 
requested location. He moved it across the street from where we asked him to 
assign it. He even changed the entire bus route to accommodate for his solution, 
a tremendous amount of work for a small issue. However, assigning bus stops is 
Jack's domain. He owns it. He's responsible for it. He is in control. No one is 
going to tell Jack how to run his business. He is a thirty-year expert in bus 
safety. However, this wasn't a decision on expertise, it was old-fashioned 
bravado, ego. And, it is not limited to bus stops. It impacts every sales person 
who needs to engage multiple people in the buying process to get the account 
awarded to them. </p>
<p>As I hung up the phone with Jack, it dawned on me. I coach sales people on 
how to work strategically in an account and we failed miserably in this 
circumstance. One of the perils I share with sales people is leaving the 
ultimate decision-maker out of the solution development process. Think about a 
sale that you lost, that you thought you were going to win. And, you thought you 
were going to win because you had a great relationship with the <i>administrator</i>. 
You and the administrator had crafted the entire solution in such a way that he 
could march into his boss's office for the proverbial rubber stamp. </p>
<p>Many years ago, I learned, painfully, that there is no such thing as a rubber 
stamp. Many sales people hear &quot;rubber stamp&quot; and feel confident that they are 
working with the right person. &quot;The sale is mine!&quot; If anything, the rubber stamp 
is simply the fuse on a stick of dynamite. Better get under your desk, your deal 
is about to implode! </p>
<p>Here is what happens behind the scenes as your administrator visits with his 
boss. &quot;Mr Jones, I've found a new supplier for our widgets. The sales rep is 
terrific. We've worked together and developed an ideal solution that makes 
everyone's life easier and we'll save 10% on our spending.&quot; &quot;Put it in my 
inbox,&quot; says, Mr. Jones. Days become weeks as the administrator pings Mr. Jones 
about his rubber stamp, but no signature is forthcoming. </p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Jones develops an interest in his widget purchasing and surfs 
the web for potential suppliers. He meets with three of them and finds one to 
his liking. &quot;This supplier is going to save the company 10.25%&quot;. Guess who got 
the deal? However, the sales person never knows about this because the 
administrator is too embarrassed to call him. After all, the administrator said 
this was just a rubber stamp, you had been awarded the business. Communication 
with the administrator goes dark; he just stops responding to your emails and 
voicemails. </p>
<p>What sales people often forget is that as you go up the corporate ladder, 
business leaders maintain accountability for the lower rungs of their 
responsibility. Thus, they want to feel as if they are involved in the solution 
development phase, or at least be offered the opportunity to participate. When 
administrators fly into their office with what they feel is a great decision, 
they are rebuffed. And, for one core reason, EGO! While the administrator's plan 
may very well be a great one, it is met with resistance for the simple reason 
that his manager was not invited to participate in the process. When he finally 
becomes interested enough to look at this issue, his goal becomes proving that 
there is a better deal to be had. In essence, this approach creates a saboteur 
of your deal. </p>
<p>If you are the sales person dealing with the administrator, how do you have 
the conversation where you share the concern of their manager not being involved 
in the process without offending? It takes a tremendous amount of finesse and 
strategic planning. However, if you truly have your client's best interests at 
heart, it is easy. This is the ultimate key. If you are committed to ensuring 
that your clients achieve their goals, you can have this conversation. After 
all, you know that they won't get what they want if you continue down this path.
