A New Perspective On Procrastination</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Christopher R. Edgar</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
  <div>
    At some point in your life, I'll bet you felt like you weren't getting 
    enough done. You wished you could keep your attention on your work, and stop 
    &#8220;procrastinating&#8221; by doing frivolous or unimportant things, but it just 
    didn't seem possible. I used to have this problem myself, until I had a 
    realization one day that transformed my understanding of what 
    procrastination is and how to deal with it.</div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">
  <div>
    <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; TEXT-DECORATION: none">At work, I would 
    sometimes have trouble staying on task. After working on a project for a 
    little while, I'd find myself losing focus and finding ways to avoid being 
    productive. I would deal with low-priority work issues, read the news, or 
    get antsy and pace around the room. I'd then try to get back to my project, 
    but I'd feel like every cell in my body was resisting my will.</p>
    <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; TEXT-DECORATION: none">My normal reaction to 
    this experience was one I think most of us identify with&#8212;I shamed myself. 
    &#8220;Come on, get a work ethic,&#8221; I'd tell myself. My belief was that I 
    procrastinated because I was fundamentally a lazy and selfish person, and 
    that I only cared about doing what I wanted to do instead of helping others 
    achieve their goals. The only way to change this mindset, I figured, was to 
    punish myself until I became willing to change my &#8220;evil ways.&#8221; 
    Unfortunately, beating myself up only seemed to strengthen my body's 
    resistance to getting work done.</p>
    <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in; TEXT-DECORATION: none">
    <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none">One day, however, I made an interesting 
    observation while I was having trouble focusing. I noticed that, while I was 
    reading the news, checking e-mail, or doing some other unproductive activity 
    to avoid work, I wasn't actually enjoying myself. Even as I procrastinated, 
    I was thinking to myself &#8220;this is boring. I want to do something else.&#8221;</span></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none">This 
    observation didn't support my theory that I procrastinated because I was 
    lazy and only cared about having fun. If that were true, you'd think I would 
    have enjoyed my frivolous diversions. But in fact, while I was in 
    &#8220;procrastination mode,&#8221; I didn't like doing </span><i>
    <span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none">anything</span></i><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none">. 
    Procrastination, I recognized, was just a symptom of an overall attitude 
    that sometimes overtook me&#8212;an attitude of refusing to accept the situation I 
    was in, regardless of what it was.</span></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none">For 
    whatever reason, I had moments when my mind basically decided it wasn't okay 
    with any aspect of reality, and became determined to reject anything the 
    world gave it as inadequate and &#8220;boring.&#8221; I call this mindset one of </span>
    <i><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none">non-acceptance</span></i><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none">. 
    Some spiritual teachers call it &#8220;saying 'no' to the present moment.&#8221; I 
    procrastinated when I was in this state.</span></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none">Happily, 
    simply recognizing that I was in a place of non-acceptance had the effect of 
    liberating me from that place. If I just admitted to myself that I was 
    saying &#8220;no&#8221; to my situation, without punishing myself for it, I'd find my 
    refusal to accept reality dissolving, and a peace and alertness pervading my 
    body. Once in this state, I could concentrate on my work again.</span></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none">If you 
    find yourself procrastinating at times, and you want to improve your ability 
    to focus, I have two suggestions for you that build on the realization I 
    described.</span></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><i><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none">First</span></i><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none">, 
    be aware of, and acknowledge, when you're in a state of non-acceptance. To 
    start doing this, notice that, when you find yourself procrastinating, 
    nothing seems to satisfy you. You can try doing a few different activities 
    to prove this point&#8212;you can read the news, play solitaire, call a friend or 
    loved one, and so forth. You'll start to see that, when you're in a state of 
    non-acceptance, everything you do seems to be inadequate, boring or 
    unfulfilling for one reason or another.</span></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none">The 
    central lesson is that, when you are in this state, looking for something 
    better to do won't help, but recognizing that you have this attitude will 
    get you back on track. Once you see that your mind is rejecting reality, 
    admit it to yourself. Saying it out loud, for me, is the quickest way to 
    dissolve my state of non-acceptance. &#8220;I don't like anything right now,&#8221; I'll 
    say to myself. &#8220;Nothing is good enough.&#8221; Normally, when I say this, I find 
    myself laughing, and the boredom and discomfort I had been feeling 
    disappear.</span></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><i><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none">Second</span></i><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none">, 
    start noticing what events tend to put you in a state of non-acceptance. In 
    other words, what usually happens right before you lapse into that state? 
    Maybe it's a communication with a certain person at work; a particular type 
    of document you have to prepare; a certain hour of the day; or something 
    else. For example, I would start &#8220;saying no&#8221; to the world whenever I'd get 
    an e-mail from a colleague checking on my progress on a project. I'd feel 
    like they didn't appreciate the quality of my work or how much effort I put 
    into it, and I'd start getting resentful. For at least a few minutes after I 
    got that e-mail&#8212;and perhaps a few hours&#8212;nothing I'd do would seem enjoyable 
    or meaningful.</span></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none">When I 
    figured out that I'd start rejecting reality whenever I would receive this 
    type of e-mail, I became mentally prepared for, and able to stay productive 
    in, that situation. Whenever I'd get an e-mail checking on my progress, I 
    would simply acknowledge to myself that I was about to enter a state of 
    non-acceptance, and that, once I was in that state, nothing would be able to 
    satisfy me. Admitting to myself I was about to say &#8220;no&#8221; to the world would 
    dissipate my resistance to reality, and help me regain my focus.</span></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none">Why do 
    certain situations cause us to reject reality? In my view, we say &#8220;no&#8221; to 
    the world when we feel that the world doesn't love or appreciate us. Saying 
    &#8220;no&#8221; is our way of telling the world &#8220;you don't care about me, so I'm not 
    going to enjoy you or do anything for you.&#8221;</span></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none">Often, the 
    situations where we react this way resemble moments from our childhoods when 
    we felt rejected or neglected by our parents. For instance, after some 
    reflection, I recognized that, when a colleague would ask how a project was 
    going, I'd feel the same way I did when, as a kid, one of my parents asked 
    whether I was done with my chores yet. In those moments, I felt like I was 
    only appreciated for the quality of my work&#8212;as though I were a machine, or 
    something less than human&#8212;and I'd feel the vindictive urge to shut out the 
    world.</span></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in"><span style="TEXT-DECORATION: none">Overcoming 
    procrastination is about becoming aware of those situations where you tend 
    to reject reality. Simply gaining that awareness, and acknowledging&#8212;without 
    beating yourself up&#8212;when you've said &#8220;no&#8221; to your circumstances, is an 
    effective method for dissolving that &#8220;no&#8221; and getting your productivity 
    back. Just accepting the fact that you're in a rut, without blame or 
    judgment, is often the fastest way to pull yourself out of it.</span></p>
