What Is Your Gibberish Component?</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Thejendra BS</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A caveman sees a saber toothed tiger approaching his cave. What did he 
communicate to his wife and kids? </p>
<p>Did he scream, &quot;RUN AND HIDE !!!&quot; </p>
<p>Or should he have said? </p>
<p>&#8220;Folks, I see an immediate threat from a ferocious creature seeking palatable 
items to fulfill his non-negotiable needs, which poses a serious danger and 
disruption to all of us. It is imperative that we take immediate action to 
mitigate the grave risk by urgently harnessing the power of our legs.&#8221; </p>
<p>Which one would have communicated the message better to his family? Back in 
the stone ages the first sentence would have produced the necessary results. But 
in our modern times it is doubtful whether such a plain and simple sentence 
would have been considered acceptable as proper communication. Today the word 
&quot;communication&quot; is a common buzzword in all business environments worldwide. 
Secondly, the need for effective communication has also become a top priority 
among all business leaders. And as an employee at any level you would have 
definitely attended (or conducted) heaps of communication sessions on various 
business or customer issues. Worldwide organizations are also spending millions 
of dollars every year on corporate communications in every conceivable and 
innovative flavors. And they will normally be in the form of team meetings, 
intranets, brochures, speeches, emails, slide presentations, workshops, offsites, 
video presentations, etc. Naturally you will agree that a lot of effort, time 
and money are required for such activities. However, there is still something 
that always bothers most employees. It happens to all of us in the business 
world everyday. You read a company brochure, a corporate communication, a 
strategy or a business proposal from head to toe, and then you read it again and 
perhaps again. But all you get is a feeling that you are simply reading the 
words without any meaningful information entering your brain. Or in some cases 
you attend a flashy business presentation, or a seminar or a business speech by 
a management guru that lasts for an hour. You remember walking in with a lot of 
hope and anticipation, but always end up walking out blank, confused and unable 
to remember anything the speaker spoke for more than an hour. After it is over 
you begin to think, &quot;I don't understand. What exactly was the speaker talking 
about? What exactly do I need to do?&quot; But you feel embarrassed to ask for 
clarification or what exactly was it. Why was it all fuzzy to you? You may also 
begin to wonder if there is something wrong with your brain for being unable to 
understand what was being said. Or think the stuff they are presenting is too 
advanced and beyond your humble capabilities, and perhaps not for ordinary 
mortals. So where is the problem? To get the answer just keep reading. </p>
<p>You may be surprised to know that worldwide millions of employees experience 
the same confusion and fuzziness as you do in every modern workplace everyday, 
but are simply too embarrassed or even scared to admit it. If you are one such 
employee in any workplace I suggest you stop worrying about your situation. 
Frankly, there is nothing wrong with you as we shall shortly see. And there is 
no need to visit any brain surgeon, psychiatrist or refresh your grammar. The 
problem does not lie with you. The culprit is actually business jargon. So what 
exactly is business jargon? A general dictionary defines jargon as, 
&quot;Unintelligible or meaningless talk or writing, gibberish. Any talk or writing 
that one does not understand.&quot; And business jargon is the art of talking (or 
writing) about various business issues using complicated and confusing words. 
Usage of jargon is the root cause of miscommunication in most modern 
organizations. Going one step further businesses today simply don't use easy and 
simple words to convey a message. Instead they use complex, complicated and 
often meaningless words to impress the recipients. They use all kinds of big 
words, nonsense words and gibberish in the hope of impressing their audiences 
with their superior intellect. Or they try to prove they are selling something 
unique or revolutionary. It is this jargon that is the root cause of 
miscommunication worldwide. However, without realizing jargon as the root cause 
of miscommunication, employees in most modern organizations mistakenly complain 
there is no communication at all from their management. But there is actually 
enough communication happening all around to drown you to the depths of the 
earth. In fact, managements today do take enormous pain and effort in dumping 
truckloads of communication on their employees, shareholders, company websites, 
brochures, advertisements, etc. What is clearly lacking is a simple easy to 
understand message from the communicator that everyone in the intended audience 
can understand. So when employees complain that there is lack of communication 
it actually means that information is not available in an understandable manner.
</p>
<p>Today jargon and hype is killing effective communications in most modern 
organizations. Heavy usage of business jargon is the single biggest reason for 
complete failure of communications in organizations worldwide, often leading to 
disastrous results. Realistically speaking, commonly used business statements 
and phrases like, &quot;We deliver superior value and competitive advantage by 
focusing on our core competencies&quot; has absolutely no meaning, or it can mean 
different things to different people. However, it has become a fashion in most 
organizations to use complex and colorful words in most business areas. Just 
visit any business website and you only see plenty of meaningless colorful 
words, self congratulatory sentences and lot of self trumpeting about their 
products, services and the special breed of vibrant people they have. Words like 
synergy, value add, core, catalyst, vision, mission, information-centric, people 
oriented, horizontal and vertical solutions, etc., are commonly and generously 
used in every brochure, presentations, websites, speeches, etc., to give the 
audience an impression of superiority. For example, if you are buying any 
product, service or just about anything on websites these days it is nearly 
impossible for you to get the required essential details like specifications, 
cost, etc., quickly without first wading though several kilometers of jargon 
describing how great the company is, its fantastic ever smiling people, their 
immense passion for serving you and so on. </p>
<p><b>The Risks of Jargon: </b>The harm that jargon can cause may not be 
immediately obvious to many. But it can have a corrosive effect and cause more 
problems than a total lack of communications. Some of the not so obvious 
problems jargon and hype can create are as follows. </p>
<p><b>1. Message gets lost: </b>Organizations and business leaders these days 
fear simplicity and that is why they try to make things complex by using 
business jargon, complex words and so on. Very often business speakers try to 
dazzle their audience with high sounding words, colorful presentations and all 
sorts of gimmicks in the hope of doing effective communications. But usually 
they end up doing exactly the opposite, which is ineffective communication, 
confusion and brainwashing the audience. When colorful language and complicated 
words are used the real message gets lost or buried so deep that no one can 
understand. There will be plenty of talk, but no clear message. Secondly it 
bores and confuses the listener. In many cases the message gets twisted out of 
shape, can convey different meanings to different people and can lead to reading 
in between the lines to spread rumors. People will not be able to ask 
appropriate questions or cannot ask any questions at all because nothing is 
clear. Or a few smart ones will ask some more jargon filled questions to get 
some more jargon filled answers. But it makes things only complicated and does 
not serve the purpose. If you want to convey the message you should be straight 
and simple like Reagan used to talk. For example, during the cold war era, 
President Reagan told Gorbachev, &#8220;General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek 
peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you 
seek liberalization: Come here to this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. 
Gorbachev, tear down this wall.&#8221; He was referring to the Berlin wall that 
divided east and west Germany. He did not beat around the bush with empty words 
like many diplomats do. </p>
<p><b>2. Attracts liars and cheats: </b>Jargon is often the backdoor for liars, 
cheats and hollow people to enter organizations. For example, it is quite common 
to see most job ads like, &#8220;We are looking for high value employees dedicated to 
delivering constant innovation to assist our clients in high performance 
delivery and meet our strategic goals. The employee must be a class of his own 
and raise his or her sights above the horizon. He or she must be a people leader 
who has the challenge to outdo themselves and be a global winner all the way to 
confidently swim in an ocean of opportunities.&#8221; Assume two qualified candidates 
apply for a particular job or position in an organization. The normal method is 
to interview the candidate based on the resume they submit. Now assume one 
candidate has a simple and straightforward resume, while the other submits a 
fancy one with lots of colorful words and sentences that trumpet and glorifying 
the routine (or even mediocre) work done in his previous job. In all probability 
the candidate with the fancy resume will be able to clinch the job with his or 
her choice of words that can impress the interviewer. Hype and jargon can 
portray a picture that the candidate has a keen grasp of the big picture, an 
excellent leader, a supreme intellectual, etc. For example a fancy sentence 
like, &#8220;I was the key leader and catalyst for enhancing customer centric business 
landscapes&quot; stated in a pompous manner can make the interviewer fall off his 
chair mesmerized. But the actual work in all probability will not be rocket 
science or something that ordinary mortals cannot do or learn. However the other 
candidate who tries to explain his work in ordinary and real world terms will 
definitely lose his chance for the job, while the bogus chap will get selected. 
Soon every job advertisements in the organization will become complicated and 
confusing, and will prevent honest people from applying for such jobs. This is 
because honest and knowledgeable people applying to such positions may feel, &#8220;Oh 
my god, they are expecting to hire some fancy rocket scientist who can innovate 
daily. I don&#8217;t think I can do that.&#8221; So organizations end up hiring liars, 
cheats, bogus people and hot air specialists. </p>
<p><b>3. Jargon corrupts everyone: </b>Business jargon is not only confusing and 
misleading, it is also very contagious. If you work in any modern organization 
you will soon start talking and writing hot air. You can no longer speak plain 
English. Once jargon and hype becomes the standard in an organization, it will 
no longer be possible for any employee or department to conduct meetings, 
seminars, presentations, etc., without the necessary dosages of colorful words 
and gibberish. You soon become terrified of simplicity. Anyone who uses ordinary 
words or refuse to join the language insanity will be classified as a simpleton 
who will not be suitable for managing large teams, big projects, deal with the 
top brass, and so on. </p>
<p><b>4. Delay and Money: </b>You can&#8217;t shoot a target you can&#8217;t see. Similarly 
you can&#8217;t do what you don&#8217;t understand. Organizational decision making and speed 
suffers as even the most trivial of reports, proposals, decisions and output 
gets delayed because it does not contain the necessary dosages of jargon. So 
organizations waste time, money and effort in trying to meet each other&#8217;s 
expectations and requirements that is not available in an easy simple to use 
language. </p>
<p>So what can you do to make communication effective? </p>
<p>The key to effective communication is straightforwardness and the use of 
simple words. Winston Churchill, one of the most straightforward talking leaders 
history has produced would say, &#8220;If you have an important point to make, don't 
try to be subtle or clever. Use a pile driver. Hit the point once. Then come 
back and hit it again. Then hit it a third time-a tremendous whack.&#8221; This should 
be your approach to communication, though you may not need a pile driver at all 
times. </p>
<p>For communication to occur two parties are required. One is the person saying 
or writing something, and the other is the person listening or reading it. 
Depending on who you are at the moment you can do your bit to avoid jargon and 
make the communication clear. <br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>If you are the communicator: </h3>
<p>1. Your message will be clearly heard only if you use plain language and 
simple words that people can remember. So ask yourself whether you genuinely 
intend to convey the message and communicate, or you just want to impress others 
with your keen grasp of colorful and complicated words. . </p>
<p>2. Business jargon has been a laughing matter for years and will make you 
look like a bogus person. Remember that the actual work people do is quite 
different from the bogus and fancy job descriptions associated with it. Just 
because you are a senior person you do not have to use complicated words to get 
something done. Remember juniors, newcomers and spectators will not openly tell 
you they did not understand anything, but will laugh at you behind your back.
</p>
<p>3. There is nothing to be ashamed of if you use simple words. Remember if a 
million people say a foolish thing it is still a foolish thing. So just because 
every businessman you know or see talks gibberish, you don&#8217;t have to join the 
bandwagon to survive. </p>
<p>4. If you are just a postman conveying someone's message first make sure you 
have clearly understood what is to be said so that you don't pass the wrong 
message. </p>
<p>5. Ask yourself, do you talk like that at home or with your neighbors and 
relatives? Can you really talk like that at home? Unless it is confidential, 
print a copy and show it to your mom or wife and ask if they can understand what 
is written. If they say &quot;Duh !!!&quot; then you get the point. </p>
<p>6. Employees avoid managers and leaders who talk gibberish. So become a 
person that ordinary people can connect with and approachable for help and 
advice. Today people already suffer from information overload and hype. They 
don&#8217;t want more of such stuff and crave for simplicity.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>If you are the listener: </h3>
<p>As a listener or a recipient you need to think about what choices you have to 
accept or prevent jargon. Remember jargon is mainly used by senior people and 
management gurus. You will very rarely hear junior employees speaking jargon.
</p>
<p>1. If you are sitting and listening to a general business speech then jargon 
may not impact you much. However, with one-on-one discussions with customers, 
bosses, supervisors, etc., you should never accept jargon without asking probing 
questions that will give you a realistic picture of what needs to be done. Peter 
Drucker once said, &quot;My greatest strength as a consultant is to be ignorant and 
ask a few simple questions.&quot; So become a Drucker and ask simple questions, even 
dumb ones if necessary for better clarification. Do not hesitate to state you 
did not understand something. Dumb questions are better than making false and 
wrong assumptions that lead to disastrous end results. </p>
<p>2. Not accepting jargon may not be possible as it is mainly used by senior 
people and management gurus. If it is just some generic advice you can probably 
ignore it as nobody will remember it six hours later. In all probability the 
communicator will not be able to repeat the exact same sentence again if it was 
filled with jargon. But if there is real work to be done you will need clear 
information to start. So if you are dumped with jargon you should try to 
rephrase it into simple terms and ask the teller, <i>&quot;This is what I understood. 
Correct me if I am wrong.&quot;</i> </p>
<p>3. Remember one thing. Unless you are not paying attention, communication is 
all about understanding the message right by the intended audience in a manner 
everyone can fully understand. But if you know the subject and do not understand 
even when paying attention, it is either dripping with jargon or it is about a 
subject that you are not familiar with. For example, a botanist can talk a 
simple sentence mixed with biology terms, which you may not understand. That is 
understandable and cannot be called bad communication. </p>
<p>Finally, we can conclude this article with a quote from Leonardo da Vinci who 
said, <i>&#8220;Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.&#8221;</i></p>
