The Value of A Sounding Board</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Richard Derwent Cooke </i> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="quote"><i>In times of Change, people feel much more secure with strong and clear 
leadership, but they need considered action and decisions from their leaders. 
The trouble is, with the pace of business today, the pressure has never been 
higher and consequently there is always a temptation to act just for the sakes 
of moving things off the pending pile and appearing decisive. Change specialist 
Richard Derwent Cooke suggests that sometimes, the best way forward is in fact to 
stand still for a moment a lend some quality time to a spot of good old 
fashioned conversation. </i> </p>
<p>I suspect that many of today&#8217;s leaders, like me, were brought up watching 
westerns on TV, listening to John Wayne mouthing phrases like &#8220;A man&#8217;s got to 
do, what a man&#8217;s go to do..&#8221; and watching him ride off into the sunset. This, in 
a way, typified a generation&#8217;s thinking of what strength and leadership was all 
about. Whilst many recognise this is an outmoded idea in the 21st century, it is 
sometimes hard to shake off some of the legacies of this thinking. </p>
<p>However, leaders are usually dealing with complex, multi-faceted problems 
which require more consideration. Busy leaders often are battling with are 
over-stuffed diaries and this means that they have little quality time to 
reflect and consider. </p>
<p>I often find leaders gain huge value from working with an external &#8216;sounding 
board&#8217;. They may call this person a coach, a mentor, or even a friend or 
colleague, but the role is clear. It is someone they respect, who they can 
confide in and who can challenge their thinking process. Booking time with 
someone you can talk to about your agenda, in complete confidence, has a number 
of benefits:- </p>
<ul>
  <li>It makes space for you to think things through </li>
  <li>The very act of explaining 
your ideas &amp; issues to someone clarifies your own thinking </li>
  <li>Having your 
thinking challenged in a safe environment gives you the chance to develop your 
ideas further, and if necessary, change direction completely with no loss of 
face, and with no adverse consequences </li>
  <li>An outsider can ask those apparently 
daft, but highly challenging questions such as <i>&#8220;Why would you want to do that?&#8221; 
&#8220;What would happen if you didn&#8217;t do that?&#8221; </i>etc. </li>
  <li>They should sit outside the organisation&#8217;s politics and therefore not need to play power games 
  </li>
  <li>They are 
able to bring in new ideas from outside the organisation </li>
  <li>They can also see 
when the leader is part of the problem and highlight when (s)he needs to 
consider their own contribution to the situation. </li>
</ul>
<p>Leaders will typically leave these sessions much more focused and clear about 
what they need to do; more focused on what is really important for them to do 
and where they can afford (or need to) delegate. They usually find that the 
amount of work they get through in these sessions exceeds their expectations.
</p>
<p>Time spent in reflection and exploration with a trusted &#8216;sounding board&#8217; is a 
good way of reducing stress both for the leader and their organisation. 
Decisions that have been thought through inspire more confidence, and this 
raises the leader&#8217;s &#8216;stock&#8217; with his people and their willingness to follow his 
lead. In the end this saves a great deal of time both in needless discussion and 
rework, because (s)he is passing out clear, simple messages. </p>
<p>There is a natural &#8216;sieving &amp; sorting&#8217; process, not unlike doing a jigsaw 
puzzle, where you gather together all of bits that are similar and create a 
clearer, more complete picture. This process helps sequence your messages in a 
way that makes your overall story much more coherent and easily accepted. </p>
<p>As a human being, it is natural for a leader to have doubts, and it is a part 
of the job to explore them as honestly as possible. This is a naturally 
uncomfortable process and it helps to have someone support you through it to 
make sure it is done both with integrity and completeness. The other side of 
this confidence is that some people are over-confident and need to almost 
delegate this doubting role to a trusted third party. This was why, in days of 
old, kings had Fools or Jesters&#61569;&#61570; who had license to say exactly what they 
thought, as truthfulness tends to shrivel as gets closer to power. </p>
<p>When, in the words of Harry Truman, <i>&#8220;The buck stops here!&#8221; </i>it is both helpful 
and responsible to pause to consider whether you are planning not only to do 
things right, but more importantly , to do the right things! It is all too easy 
for leaders to get sucked into operational details and it is their job to ensure 
that the issues that are strategic have been properly identified and planned 
for. If a leader isn&#8217;t strategic in the use of their own time, then the chances 
are they are not being sufficiently strategic in other areas! The chairman of a 
very large business I work with said to me the other day that he could only 
discuss a particular issue with two other people in his team, and he already 
knew what they would both say, and he needed a fresh perspective on this issue. 
This is by no means untypical, and it is a wise man who knows when it is a good 
idea to seek help. </p>
<p>Another function that can be valuably performed in this safe space is 
venting. Once words are spoken they can not be unspoken and in every team there 
are frustrations, doubts and fears. These can all get in the way of the smooth 
running of the business. Deciding which issues are ones you need to take up with 
someone directly and which ones are just the result of, perhaps, you having a 
bad day can make you a much better person to work with. </p>
<p>This process is not about someone else coming in and telling you how to run 
your business, something that you are uniquely qualified to do, rather, in the 
words of Ken Keyes, they help you to &#8220;get at the wisdom you already have.&#8221; When 
this is supplemented with a little outside input it becomes a very potent dish.
