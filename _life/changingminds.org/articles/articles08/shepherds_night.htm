<h1>Shepherds of the Night:
How dreams help artists develop creativity</h1>

<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="../articles.htm">Guest articles</a> &gt; Shepherds of the Night:
How dreams help artists develop creativity</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Barbara Bowen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Susan is dining in an airport café. A loud speaker suddenly blasts a warning 
that a harsh military regime is due to arrive momentarily. Frantic, Susan jumps 
up and begins to bury her food under the dirt floor, determined to cover her 
tracks. Doing so, however, it dawns on her that the food's smell is a dead 
giveaway, and to bury it is &quot;an exercise in futility.&quot; </p>
<p>It was &quot;only&quot; a dream? </p>
<p>Whether layered and profound, or simple fragmentary flashes, night dreams 
often exhort us to develop our creativity in the practical world. In offering 
artists career help, artists dreams are one of my favorite tools. They hold 
power to reflect, forecast, indicate new personal growth, and strengthen career 
resolve. They never give answers, but they often point. Across a dream's broad 
spiritual terrain, clues dwell, and once perceived, they act like compasses 
giving direction. The true Creative Voice, if lost in the woods, always wants 
out. The actual dreams profiled here will help artists to explore their dreams 
for guidance. </p>
<p>When Susan came for help developing creativity, her goal was to re-activate 
artistic gifts she had lost touch with. A career in child development engaged 
her creatively, but that was not enough. She craved personal expression, but 
fear was stopping her. </p>
<p>Pondering the dream, a single implication began to take full shape among 
murkier prospects; Susan feared exposure and judgment, but she could no longer 
deny the existence of her deeper gifts. Despite her efforts to bury them (the 
food), hiding the evidence was &quot;futile.&quot; Her gifts exist, unceasingly, as vital 
animating forces that fuel her &quot;travels,&quot; or life path. For Susan, this news was 
bittersweet. Her wide-eyed excitement was laced with apprehension. For most of 
us, undertaking change and personal growth isn't purely a picnic. But it's worth 
it. When we're ready, it's time for action. In our coaching process, we kept 
exploring the delicate braid of her creative process, striving for clarity and 
setting moderate goals during her transition. </p>
<p>In a later dream, a dog approaches Susan in a field. Indistinct people 
command her to bury the dog alive. Aghast, she replies with an unqualified &quot;No!&quot; 
and remains solid in her refusal. Susan's willingness to resuscitate her 
personal creativity, and to protect it, was growing. This dream was a friendly 
mirror saying, &quot;Well done, look at the progress you are making!&quot; Susan's dreams 
were often potent guides, easing her transitional anxieties, and helping her to 
unleash enormous amounts of artistic energy and creativity in drawing and music.
</p>
<p>Everyone has night dreams, remembered or not, as a part of REM sleep. Sigmund 
Freud's sexual theory insisted that dreams protect us from voracious instincts 
boiling up from the oily basement of the power-hungry ID. Composed of symbolic 
clues to self-knowledge, the dream, said Freud, is a &quot;royal road to the 
unconscious.&quot; Carl Gustav Jung later broke with Freud's concept of the 
unconscious, conceiving it as more a repository of wisdom than a storm-filled 
dungeon of wishes and fears. For Dr. Jung, dreams were less concealers, and more 
revealers, of truth. Our dreams come packaged in various forms; ephemeral 
flashes, jolting realism, subtle wisps, or even a confluence of seeming 
nonsense. They range from abstraction to confused or coherent narratives. Their 
imagery can carry innocuous, inspirational, or traumatic impact. No matter how 
clarified, puzzling or outlandish their language may be, our dreams are trying 
to tell us something. They often require us to dwell for a time within 
ambiguities, to bathe in cool pools of uncertainty, before we profess to know 
what they have in mind. </p>
<p>From what deep strata of consciousness do these &quot;shepherds of the night&quot; 
emerge? Jung's theory suggests that our psyches are born connected to a deeper 
collective &quot;ocean&quot; of awareness from which our personal dreams flow. Like 
tributaries, dreams deliver ancient motifs that play a mysterious role in 
humanity's evolution of consciousness. Jung interfaced with multiple traditions 
and tribes, gleaning rich source material on the nature of dreams. For ancient 
cultures across the world, dreams held more than mere fascination. Indian tribes 
such as the Lakota Sioux, Salish, Hopi, Iroquois, and Maya are well known for 
sharing their dreams openly, and initiating interpreters to plum their depths 
for vital clues to social, political and spiritual problem solving. </p>
<p>James, a client aspiring to become a novelist, had an inner critic slowing 
his projects down. His dreams were powerful. In one, he arrives in front of a 
church. Angelic melodies sung by feminine voices ring out from behind it. 
Enchanted, James follows them to a courtyard outside the sanctuary. There he 
sees a choir of beautiful women shrouded in gauzy white sheets. He is 
emotionally moved. He enters the church through a back door, where a curator 
stands accompanied by piles of art proofs. He contends, fastidiously, that James 
must have a ticket for entry. Producing one from his pocket, James is led by the 
curator down a curving, stair-like contraption to a basement level under the 
sanctuary. There is yet another level below this one, but no stairway leading 
down to it. There hangs an alluring painting of a magnificent unicorn. The 
curator jumps blithely down the stairless &quot;cliff&quot; and lands near to the 
painting. James, still perched on the level above and watching him, is tempted 
to follow suit but unable to gather his nerve to jump. The curator looks up and 
scoffs at him for playing it safe. </p>
<p>This relatively complex dream exemplifies the need for incremental 
inspection. A slow pace brings richer rewards, like a savory long-cooked stew. 
The avant garde elements of the church (an outdoor choir and subterranean art 
gallery) signify a spiritual context, one that defies traditional norms. James 
is &quot;called&quot; by an unorthodox, near-angelic choir. He enters the church through 
the &quot;back door.&quot; This imagery invited James to apprehend his creativity as a 
profound mystery, issuing from both within and beyond the confines of church 
authority. The only authority here is a curator, an art &quot;editor&quot; of sorts, who 
makes demands but also guides James to the inner depths. </p>
<p>Tending to the images one-by-one, we discovered an over-riding insight. The 
dream curator mirrored for James what his inner critic, once transformed, might 
look like: an &quot;usher&quot; leading him to embrace the hallowed uniqueness of his 
creativity and his being (the unicorn.) We must aim not to eliminate, but to 
soften and guide the critic back into its proper role. Under the disguise of a 
Destroyer lies an Ally--a helpful &quot;editor&quot; who serves the Creative Voice on its 
mission toward actualizing itself in the world. Far from stopping him, the 
transformed critic would empower James to view his writing with an objective 
eye--to evaluate, improve upon--to uphold the standards of his initial 
inspiration. James' As our artist coaching sessions proceeded, the Creative 
Voice took the lead, and momentum on his novel grew steadily. This dream was a 
springboard. It grew more intelligible over time, like an old book of spiritual 
wisdom, revealing more upon each reading. </p>
<p>Far less enigmatic dreams are no less important. James later dreamed he was 
driving a new car, feeling at ease, mastering its controls. This fragment echoed 
the qualities of trust and reliance that were growing in his relationship with 
creativity. Christin, a real estate agent embarking upon a singing career, 
dreamed she was flying in a helicopter. Her father was &quot;driving&quot; incompetently, 
putting them in danger. The onus fell on Christin to &quot;take the controls&quot; away 
from him. This punctuated dream urged Christin to stop letting her artist 
father's negative judgments choke her creative flow. In the same vein, Robin, a 
writer and musician, dreamed that one of her artist friends could not see her, 
though they occupied the same room. Through the artist coaching process, we 
discovered Robin was feeling unacknowledged as the talented artist she is. </p>
<p>Some dreams shed light on our present or past. Others cast their rays into 
the future. In one of my dreams, I am in a forest at the top of a huge hill. I 
am being carried away by floodwaters swallowing the earth and trees. Feeling 
&quot;uprooted&quot; and out of control, I finally drift to an enormous rock jutting above 
the ominous water. I grab hold and climb on top to rest. Etched into the rock's 
surface is an ancient inscription, awesomely powerful but inscrutable. I feel 
wholly reassured by it. When the rising water level is about to submerge the 
rock, I am forced to get back in and swim. Now fortified, I instinctively know 
what direction will lead toward safety. Soon, in the distance, I see the top of 
an unthinkably tall ladder leading down to dry land. I swim toward it, relieved, 
but knowing that heavy days are awaiting me. Shortly after this dream, a 
multiplex web of transitional challenges arose in my life at once, in the forms 
of death, career and personal life. I think the dream was a talisman to hold 
onto when events began to &quot;uproot&quot; me and threaten my faith. It struck me first 
as a mysterious and spiritual poem about staying grounded. It matured to become, 
in retrospect, a personal symbol of hope. </p>
<p>These are called &quot;precognitive&quot; dreams. They forecast coming events, 
sometimes with uncanny accuracy. Abraham Lincoln dreamed of his own 
assassination. The tutor for Austria's Archbishop Franz Ferdinand dreamed his 
pupil would be assassinated at Sarajevo, the event that precipitated World War 
1. These dreams have enduring ripple affects, viewed from new perspectives with 
time. They call into question spiritual aspects of our lives, and the 
progression of time itself. The Jewish, Christian and Islamic traditions are 
full dream life, viewed as emanations from a realm mystics call &quot;Timeless.&quot; The 
biblical prophet Daniel, for example, interpreted the dreams of Babylon's King 
Nebuchadnezzar. Daniel himself experienced &quot;night visions&quot; thought to symbolize 
future power struggles between the earthly kingdoms (or nations) of the world. 
Jung wrote of &quot;an existence outside time which runs parallel with existence 
inside time.&quot; Dreams may be a sort of universal gateway to this &quot;Timeless&quot; 
realm, one that quantum physics might describe as the &quot;non-material sphere of 
awareness.&quot; A Christian may call it &quot;God,&quot; a Buddhist, &quot;Enlightenment.&quot; </p>
<p>Another artist, Claudia, dreamed of a gypsy woman: Four men lift a square 
table by its four corners and carry it into her house. As a result, the room 
becomes more spacious and open. The majestic interior is full of intriguing 
artifacts and exotica. The gypsy is well pleased. In this dream, the gypsy 
represented a fey, spontaneous side of Claudia that needed &quot;more room.&quot; The 
image inspired Claudia to breathe new life into her creativity and her projects. 
It's a rare four-cornered table that requires four men to move it. Four is 
sometimes perceived as a symbol for transcendence, or the &quot;fourth dimension,&quot; 
Great literature such as the Parsifal myth and Goethe's Faust use &quot;four&quot; as a 
device to represent this realm. It seemed the gypsy was Claudia's passageway. 
One's personal history holds the vital keys to meaning, but inherited symbols 
from the deeper collective past enlarge it. </p>
<p>We have multiple names; the Transcendent, God, Enlightenment, Fourth 
Dimension, and many others. Whatever we choose to call it, the Creative Voice is 
experienced as inextricably linked to it. Even the most brilliant and 
accomplished creators have had times of struggle, even grave doubts. When the 
light is blocked, there are ways to ease the shades off. Dreams may console, 
challenge, or plain baffle us. But one thing is certain; they will always push 
at the seams of our conscious limitations, coaxing a tear that would open us to 
greater creativity, greater goals and a larger, more spiritual self. </p>
<h2>Cultivate Your Dreams </h2>
<p>- When you lie down to sleep, give yourself the gentle suggestion, &quot;I'd like 
to remember my dreams.&quot; Then, the moment you open your eyes in the morning,
think, &quot;What was I just dreaming?&quot; Close your eyes again, and allow the memory
of the dream to emerge in your mind. </p>
<p>- When reviewing dream content, take your time. Savor the images, ponder 
their meanings. Notice how your body responds to various interpretations. Your 
intuition will tell you when the meaning &quot;fits.&quot; </p>
<p>- Are there animals, other humans, other beings, elements, objects? What 
environment does your dream take place in? This suggests the area of your life 
it is referring to. For example, a living room could be about your family 
relationships or something else you associate with that space. Taking it a step 
further, you might ask if it's addressing the level of &quot;aliveness&quot; in your life.
</p>
<p>- Notice how each symbol of your dream relates to every other symbol, like a 
holograph. </p>
<p>- Strikingly bold images mean that your dream is really trying to get your 
attention. It might be trying to &quot;wake you up&quot; to something. Repeating symbols 
are important, too. Do you need more of the qualities of that symbol in your 
life? For example, if you repeatedly dream about water, perhaps you need more of 
it in your life, internally or externally. Water can symbolize consciousness 
itself. </p>
<p>- Keep a journal or recorder near your bedside. The act of writing or 
speaking the
dream often behaves in magical ways. It will expand and enrich your insights and 
personal growth. If you're in a hurry, jot down the key notes about your dream 
so you may recall it fully for later recording. </p>
<p>- Avoid symbols dictionaries. Your own life experience informs your dreams. 
You and
your intuition are the best resources. Share your dreams with a trusted friend 
or group. They may help with additional questions that lead to more insight. 
Still, your own &quot;felt sense&quot; has the final say. </p>
<p>- Avoid mincing and parsing your dream images to death. Allow them to breathe 
and
show you the gifts they bear. </p>
<p>- Dreams are one of the great free wonders of life; so have fun! </p>
