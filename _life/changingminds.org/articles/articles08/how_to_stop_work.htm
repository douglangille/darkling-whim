How To Stop Work From Feeling Like Work</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Christopher R. Edgar</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
  <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">I had an interesting conversation the other 
  night with a man I met at an event.&nbsp; We were talking about an uncomfortable 
  truth&#8212;the fact that, no matter how inspired and motivated you may feel about 
  what you do for a living, after a while it tends to start feeling like, well, 
  work.&nbsp; That is, you start subtly resenting and resisting the tasks your career 
  requires, as if someone else were forcing you to do them, and start getting 
  distracted by fantasies about what you&#8217;d rather be doing.</p>
  <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">The man I was talking to was having this 
  experience in his career.&nbsp; For several years, he worked at a large, 
  prestigious investment bank.&nbsp; Eventually, however, he started feeling burned 
  out and uninspired, and quit to start his own company.&nbsp; The firm he started 
  did &#8220;environmental investing,&#8221; investing in businesses involved in 
  energy-saving technology.&nbsp; But after a few years, he said, his job started to 
  feel like &#8220;work&#8221; again, and he&#8217;s now pondering possible exit strategies.</p>
  <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">A certain amount of this kind of feeling may be 
  inevitable.&nbsp; Every career involves some mundane tasks, like paying bills, 
  making phone calls, and buying furniture, that it&#8217;s hard to feel thrilled 
  about doing.&nbsp; However, I&#8217;ve found that, if we have the right mindset, even 
  these responsibilities don&#8217;t need to feel as burdensome as they often do.</p>
  <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">I&#8217;ve come to recognize that our work starts to 
  feel stifling and oppressive when we become too identified with the role we 
  play in it.&nbsp; When we start feeling as if our careers are part of who we are, 
  we become consumed by constant fear of performing badly in them&#8212;as if we could 
  lose part of ourselves by making a mistake.&nbsp; Ironically, taking our work this 
  seriously has us lose our drive and productivity.&nbsp; I came to this realization 
  when I saw the difference between my experience of activities I considered 
  &#8220;work&#8221; and those I thought of as &#8220;play.&#8221;</p>
  <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">For example, I&#8217;ve written a number of published 
  nonfiction pieces, but I&#8217;ve yet to publish any fiction I&#8217;ve done.&nbsp; I love 
  writing fiction just for my own and my friends&#8217; amusement.&nbsp; However, in years 
  past, whenever I&#8217;ve tried to get my fiction work in shape for publication, 
  I&#8217;ve suddenly become hypercritical of my writing.&nbsp; &#8220;How could I think people 
  would want to read this?&#8221; I&#8217;d think as I pored over a passage I&#8217;d initially 
  adored.</p>
  <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">I recently recognized that, when I start 
  thinking about publishing my fiction, a subtle shift actually takes place in 
  the way I think about myself.&nbsp; I start seeing myself not simply as a guy who 
  has fun writing fiction, but as a <em>fiction writer</em>.&nbsp; When I become 
  identified with being a fiction writer, I get overly concerned about the 
  quality of my writing and how it will be perceived.&nbsp; In other words, I start 
  needing to &#8220;live up&#8221; to the role of fiction writer, and holding my work to an 
  accordingly exacting standard.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, in these moments, &#8220;writer&#8217;s 
  block&#8221; sets in, and I find myself agonizing over every word choice and making 
  little progress.</p>
  <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">By contrast, when I choose to sit down and write 
  &#8220;just for fun,&#8221; I&#8217;m amazed by how productive and inspired I can be.&nbsp; When I&#8217;m 
  not concerned with how well I&#8217;m playing some important role, and I&#8217;m content 
  to be &#8220;just a guy who likes writing fiction,&#8221; I unquestionably do my best 
  work.</p>
  <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">Spiritual teachers have long recognized the 
  danger of becoming identified with a career or other function we perform in 
  life.&nbsp; As Osho writes in <em>Zen: The Path of Paradox</em>, taking the roles 
  we play in life too seriously can strip the joy from what we do:</p>
  <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">&#8220;When you are in the office, be a clerk, be a 
  commissioner, be a governor&#8212;that&#8217;s perfectly okay&#8212;but the moment you get out 
  of the office, don&#8217;t be a governor . . . . That governorship will be heavy on 
  your head&#8212;it won&#8217;t allow you to enjoy.&nbsp; The birds will be singing in the 
  trees, but how can a governor participate?&nbsp; How can a governor dance with the 
  birds?&nbsp; And the rains have come and a peacock may be dancing&#8212;how can a 
  governor stand there in a crowd and watch?&nbsp; Impossible, a governor has to 
  remain a governor.&#8221;</p>
  <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">How do we&nbsp;stop ourselves from identifying with 
  what we do, and retain the joy and creative power that come with freedom from 
  our roles?&nbsp; One practice I regularly use is to keep most of my body in motion 
  as I&#8217;m going through my daily activities.&nbsp; My movements may be slight&#8212;for 
  example, I may be gently rocking my hips in time with the music I&#8217;m listening 
  to.&nbsp; Or, if I&#8217;m feeling a bit more energetic, I&#8217;ll stomp my feet and 
  occasionally take a break from typing to clap my hands.</p>
  <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">This practice keeps me conscious of my humanity 
  and the simple joys of living, and prevents me from becoming too absorbed in 
  any particular role or task.&nbsp; No matter where I succeed or fail in my 
  activities, I&#8217;ll always have access to the pleasures that come from moving my 
  body in playful ways.&nbsp; When I remain aware that this source of joy will always 
  be available, regardless of what happens, the things I do in life no longer 
  feel so risky and significant.&nbsp; When my body is joyfully dancing, even with 
  very minimal movement, work no longer feels like work.&nbsp; By staying connected 
  with my body, I can turn nearly any activity, no matter how routine, into 
  &#8220;play.&#8221;</p>
  <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">Osho, again, offers a compelling explanation of 
  this phenomenon.&nbsp; When we&#8217;re aware of and using our bodies, he says, we feel 
  &#8220;rooted in the earth,&#8221; and thus whole and empowered.&nbsp; However, he writes, 
  &#8220;[i]f we are not in contact with our bodies we are not in contact with the 
  earth. . . . Because we are not rooted we are always afraid; because of that 
  fear we become possessive; because of that fear we cannot trust anybody and so 
  jealousy comes.&#8221;&nbsp; The fear created by this lack of rootedness has us 
  second-guess ourselves in what we do, and make working a stressful and 
  difficult endeavor.</p>
  <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">If your career has started to feel burdensome 
  and anxiety-laden, see if this exercise helps you.&nbsp; While you&#8217;re at work, 
  regardless of what you&#8217;re doing, experiment with keeping your body moving.&nbsp; If 
  you&#8217;re sitting at a desk, try slightly rocking your hips or tapping your 
  feet.&nbsp; Or, if you&#8217;re feeling more inspired, you can try rhythmically swaying 
  your entire body from side to side as you work.&nbsp; Try on various forms of 
  movement until you arrive at something that gets you feeling energized and 
  focused.</p>
  <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in">When you stay connected with your body in this 
  way, you&#8217;ll likely start to feel your identification with your role, and the 
  accompanying anxiety, fading away.&nbsp; Paradoxically, when you find ways to take 
  what you do less seriously, and to treat it as &#8220;play,&#8221; you&#8217;ll find your 
  passion and drive for what you do returning.</p>
