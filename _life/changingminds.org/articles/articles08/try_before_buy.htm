Try Before Buy</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Lee B. Salz</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>In the service and technology industries, it is not uncommon for prospects 
to request pilot programs before committing their full business. Yet, there are 
important steps for the sales person to take before agreeing to the engagement.
<br>
&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>The competition has been fiercely pursuing this account, but you feel like 
you have the edge. All indications are that you are going to win the business. 
Then, a call comes in from the Procurement officer who says: </p>
<p class="quote"><i>&quot;We think you guys are great and we think we are going to go 
with you. Here's what we want to do. We want to try your service for free for 
thirty days. If that goes well, we will talk about plans to go forward.&quot; </i>
</p>
<p>Is this great news? Bad news? Some sales people feel like victory is 
imminent. Other sales people feel like the sale will never happen. Which one is 
right? </p>
<p>There is the old story about the optimist who sees the glass as half full and 
the pessimist who sees the glass as half empty. The one who is often forgotten 
is the pragmatist who sees this as a nice drink. When the request for a pilot 
comes your way, there is no need to shade this as positive or negative. There is 
no need for spin. It is merely an important step of the buying process that 
requires circumspection before proceeding. Let's dissect the offer from 
Procurement. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Why try? </b>The Procurement officer says they want to try your service. 
Why do they want to do a pilot before committing? Don't guess. Ask. Some sales 
people prefer to assume that they know why this is being requested. I'm sure 
you've seen the acronym for ASSUME. The &quot;why&quot; is important to know before moving 
to the next step. Have they been burned in the past? Obviously, there is a trust 
issue here. Make no bones about it. If they fully trusted and believed in you 
and your company, the check would already be in your hands. Over the years, 
sales people have over-promised and under-delivered so buying pros want to make 
sure you do what you say you do before they turn their key. In many cases, the 
decision to award can affect business processes for the company. What if they go 
awry? </p>
<p>Consider this. Imagine a company is about to select an applicant tracking 
system to manage their recruiting process. After a tremendous amount of due 
diligence, the team feels like they have found the right provider for this 
technology. But, what if they are wrong? What if the technology fails? Does the 
entire hiring process come to a screeching halt because of it? Who will take the 
hit if that happens? This scares the Dickens out of buyers. The ability to put 
their pinky toe in the water before jumping in provides a sense of security for 
them. The bottom-line is there is a critical requirement for you to understand 
why they want to &quot;try&quot; you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Free? </b>The Procurement officer has asked for this trial period to be 
free. How do they get to decide that your product should be given for nothing? 
We would all love something for nothing, but we rarely get it. Of course, their 
famous comeback is to tell you that your competitor has agreed to do this for 
free. It reminds me of when my friend Brian was allowed to do something that I 
wasn't and I would tell my mom that Brian was allowed to go. She would simply 
say, &quot;If Brian jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge, would you want to do that too?&quot; 
Buyers don't get to demand your product for free. A good question would be, &quot;Why 
would they give their product away for free? Doesn't it have value?&quot; </p>
<p>Food for thought. What if one of their concerns is billing? How will they 
measure your ability to invoice correctly if it is free? Another consideration 
is that pilots and trials always have a cost to your company. If there is going 
to be one done for free, there best be a return. Think of it as an investment. 
No one invests without a high probability of a return. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>30 days. </b>What is magical about a month for a trial? Why not 6 days or 
28 days or 37 days? It is interesting to find out why that timeline is magical 
for this company. What data will they be able to gather in that time period? </p>
<p>What if the intent of the pilot is to demonstrate account management? Is 30 
days too short? What if they want to measure your ordering system? Is 30 days 
too long? This comes back to the recurring theme of understanding what they 
desire to accomplish in this pilot. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The non-commitment commitment. </b>Procurement folks are famous for 
committing to commit. &quot;We'll talk about plans to go forward.&quot; I don't think so! 
A free pilot with no commitment for the business? You may have been born at 
night, but I hope it wasn't last night. There are times where it makes sense to 
provide a trial for free for a period of time. However, it only makes sense to 
do that if there is a firm commitment to award you the business if the pilot 
goes well. Ah, but what does &quot;well&quot; mean? Folks, this is the most critical step 
when agreeing to do a pilot! Exactly, what metrics will be used to measure the 
success of the pilot? Without those defined metrics, you don't have a fighting 
chance of hitting the mark because there won't be a mark to hit. </p>
<p>Pilots can be an effective tool in the buying process if utilized correctly.
