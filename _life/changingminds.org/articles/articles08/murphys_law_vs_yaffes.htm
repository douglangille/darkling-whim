<h1>Murphy&#8217;s Law vs. Yaffe&#8217;s Law: A New Look at an Old Problem</h1>

Murphy&#8217;s Law vs. Yaffe&#8217;s Law: A New Look at an Old Problem</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Philip Yaffe</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For most educated persons, Murphy&#8217;s Law is the fundamental law of the 
universe, even more important than birth, death and gravity. </p>
<p>In its purest form, Murphy&#8217;s Law says: &#8220;Anything that can go wrong, will go 
wrong.&#8221; There is an important but often neglected corollary: &#8220;Many things that 
can't go wrong, will go wrong anyhow.&#8221; </p>
<p>I am now pleased to report a loophole. In at least one important area of 
human activity - expository (non-fiction) writing and public speaking - Murphy&#8217;s 
Law does not have total coverage. This is because it can be counteracted, at 
least partially, by a rival principle that I recently discovered and immodestly 
call <a href="../articles/yaffes_law.htm">Yaffe&#8217;s Law</a>.</p>
<p>Yaffe&#8217;s Law states: &#8220;If you give people what they want first, they are likely 
to accept anything else you want them to have. If you give them what you want 
first, chances are they won&#8217;t accept anything at all.&#8221; </p>
<p>In short, in a text or a speech if you quickly and securely engage the 
audience&#8217;s interest, any significant missteps later on will be muted, if not 
completely counteracted. </p>
<p>There is of course nothing new in this idea. It is just another way of saying 
that for best effect, you should write or speak starting from your audience&#8217;s 
point of view. Nevertheless, Yaffe&#8217;s Law is revolutionary because its new 
formulation focuses attention on this fundamental principle of persuasive 
communication as never before. </p>
<p>Applying the principle implies that you know the audience&#8217;s point of view. If 
you are inclined to think this is virtually impossible because point of view can 
change so very much from subject to subject and audience to audience, you would 
be making a serious mistake. </p>
<p>In most cases, readers or listeners share a single overriding concern: Will 
this text or presentation sufficiently reflect my interests and apprehensions 
that I should pay any attention to it? They want this question answered 
virtually instantaneously; otherwise they will stop reading or stop listening.
</p>
<p>In short, your first job, even before deciding what you want say, is to 
determine what your audience wants to hear. In other words, give them what they 
want first, i.e. a positive answer to this universal question. If you then 
continue positively answering it, your audience will follow you almost anywhere.
</p>
<p>Here are a couple of examples to demonstrate how the idea works. </p>
<h2>A Written Example </h2>
<p>Below, the &#8220;Original&#8221; shows a text as it might have been written without 
Yaffe&#8217;s Law. The &#8220;Revision&#8221; shows how it actually was written with Yaffe&#8217;s Law.
</p>
<h3>Original </h3>
<p>A piece of electronic equipment installed in automobiles could allow 
insurance companies to monitor the driving behavior of their customers. </p>
<p>Each time a motorist uses the car, the device will record the roads being 
traveled and the time of the journey, and send the information via satellite to 
the insurance company. </p>
<p>With this data, the company will be able to calculate the insurance premium 
for each individual journey based on the relative risk of crashes on the 
different roads at different times of the day. The motorist will receive a 
monthly or quarterly &#8220;usage statement&#8221;, similar to a telephone bill, itemizing 
the insurance cost for each use of the car. </p>
<p>By agreeing to the system, motorists could save hundreds of dollars on their 
automobile insurance. </p>
<p>Because of the lower risk of crashes, trips on superhighways will cost less 
per kilometer than on city roads, while trips on country roads will also cost 
less per kilometer than on city roads because . . . . (the text continues) </p>
<h3>Revision </h3>
<p>Motorists could save hundreds of dollars on their automobile insurance by 
allowing their driving habits be monitored by a satellite-tracking device 
installed in the vehicle. </p>
<p>Each time a motorist uses the car, the device will record the roads being 
traveled and the time of the journey, and send the information to the insurance 
company. </p>
<p>The company will then calculate the insurance premium based on an assessment 
of the relative risk of crashes on the different roads at different times of the 
day. Motorists will receive a monthly or quarterly &#8220;usage statement&#8221;, similar to 
a telephone bill, giving the insurance cost for each journey. </p>
<p>Because of the lower risk of crashes, trips on superhighways will cost less 
per kilometer than on city roads, while trips on country roads will also cost 
less per kilometer than on city roads because . . . . (the text continues) </p>
<p>The &#8220;Original&#8221; was clearly written from the point of view of the insurance 
industry. However, simply moving the fourth paragraph of the &#8220;Original&#8221; to the 
first paragraph of the &#8220;Revision&#8221; charges everything. Who wouldn&#8217;t want to know 
how to save hundreds of dollars on their automobile insurance? </p>
<p>By giving the readers what they want first, a text that might have been of 
interest only to &#8220;techno-nerds&#8221; suddenly becomes interesting to virtually 
everyone. Moreover, even if the rest of the text is not superbly written, people 
will probably continue reading anyhow, because it is in their interest to do so.
</p>
<h2>A Spoken Example </h2>
<p>With regard to Yaffe&#8217;s Law, the written word and the spoken word are exactly 
the same. Nevertheless, speaking allows use of techniques that simply would not 
work on the printed page. </p>
<p>The following speech was delivered on the subject of integrity in politics. 
Once again, the &#8220;Original&#8221; shows how it might have been written without Yaffe&#8217;s 
Law. The &#8220;Revision&#8221; shows how it actually was written with Yaffe&#8217;s Law. </p>
<h3>Original </h3>
<p>I want to talk to you this evening about a man I admire very much. His name 
is Julius Nyerere and he was the first president of Tanzania after it gained 
independence from Britain in 1961. </p>
<p>Julius Nyerere was born in 1922 in Butiama, a small village in what was then 
Tanganyika. He was the son of Nyerere Burito, a Zanaki tribal chief. At that 
time schools in Tanganyika were in very short supply. Julius began attending 
Government Primary School at the age of 12, which he completed in three years 
instead of the standard four. He did equally well in secondary school and won a 
scholarship to Makerere University in Uganda, then the only university in all of 
East Africa. </p>
<p>When he returned to Tanganyika, he worked for three years as a secondary 
school teacher of biology and English before winning a scholarship to attend the 
University of Edinburgh, where he obtained a Masters of Arts Degree in history 
and economics. This is also where he began developing the ideas and tactics that 
ultimately helped him lead Tanganyika to independence from Britain and become 
the country&#8217;s first president. Unlike many other independence movements, Nyerere 
achieved independence without a single drop of blood being shed. (The speech 
continues) </p>
<h3>Revision </h3>
<p>We live in a cynical world where the values of truth, honesty and integrity 
seem to be in short supply. We are therefore always looking for examples of such 
values in action, especially with regard to politicians. </p>
<p>I would like to offer you such an example from Africa. You have probably 
never heard of this man, but for me he stands as a true model of integrity. Can 
you guess who he might be? (Speaker pauses a few moments). No, it is not Nelson 
Mandela, as I imagine many of you were thinking. However, I am certain Mr. 
Mandela would be more than pleased to be considered in the same light as this 
person. </p>
<p>His name is Julius Nyerere. Julius Nyerere was the man who led then 
Tanganyika, today called Tanzania, to independence from Britain in 1961. Unlike 
many other independence movements, this one succeeded without a single drop of 
blood being shed. </p>
<p>I had the privilege of living two years in Tanzania shortly after 
independence. Being a city boy, for me Tanzania was quite a revelation. I 
virtually lived in a mud hut, suffered through a drought, saw leprosy, and 
experienced both malaria and dysentery. All of these things affected me. But 
getting to know Julius Nyerere as a political leader was truly a life-changing 
experience. </p>
<p>When Nyerere became head of state, he was so popular that he could easily 
have taken on the trappings of a king or potentate. But he did exactly the 
opposite. He chose to live very modestly, because that was his nature. </p>
<p>More importantly, he inspired confidence in everyone, and never betrayed that 
confidence, because that also was his nature. He of course had political 
enemies, but they were critical of certain of his ideas and policies&#8212;but never 
the man. The worst I ever heard anyone say about him was, &#8220;President Nyerere is 
doing all the wrong things for all the right reasons.&#8221; (The speech continues)
</p>
<p>At this point the speaker could insert all the information about Nyerere&#8217;s 
background and education, which seemed so tedious in the &#8220;Original&#8221;. Why? 
Because instead of tedious, the audience would now find it instructive and 
integral to understanding the man in whom their interest has been effectively 
ignited. </p>
<p>So does Yaffe&#8217;s Law pardon poor writing and poor speaking? Absolutely not!
</p>
<p>Poor writing is still poor writing, and poor speaking is still poor speaking, 
so you must constantly be alert not to fall into bad habits. </p>
<p>On the other hand, by strongly focussing your attention on giving the 
audience what they want first, when you start giving them what you want, it will 
be in a context that appeals to their most basic instincts. This, of course, is 
what persuasive communication is really all about. </p>
