<h1>Motivate Your Sales Team to Crush the Tomato</h1>

Motivate Your Sales Team to Crush the Tomato</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Lee B. Salz</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p class="quote"><i>Motivation is one of the biggest keys to developing successful teams. Every 
day strong skilled teams are beaten by lesser skilled ones loaded with heart and 
desire. But who creates the motivation for that to happen?</i></p><p>
</p><p>
</p>
<p>One of my favorite hobbies is playing baseball with my kids. I'm very 
involved with their Little League teams and volunteer to help teach baseball 
skills to the kids. My 7-year old son, Steven, is playing his first year of 
coach-pitch baseball. Prior to that, he played T-ball which is a very different 
game.</p><p>
One day at practice, I was pitching to the team of 7-year olds. Boy after boy 
came up to home plate and swung the bat as if it were a wet noodle. They picked 
up the bat, barely swung, and, as soon as they made contact with the ball, 
stopped swinging altogether. The ball dribbled a few feet in front of home plate 
and then the process began all over again. It wasn't fun for the kids to play, 
and even more painful for parents to watch.</p><p>
Having watched a few kids swing the bat like a piece of cooked linguini, I got 
an idea. I picked up the ball, walked over to the hitter, and asked what I was 
holding in my hand. The boy, looking puzzled, said, &quot;It's a ball, Coach!&quot; He 
resisted all temptation to finish that statement with, &quot;you dummy.&quot; I 
contradicted, &quot;No, it's not! It's a tomato. And the next time I throw the tomato 
over home plate, I want you to crush it with the bat. Crush the tomato!&quot; A 
dastardly smile appeared on the boy's face. He went back to home plate to hit 
again. Ball after ball sailed into the outfield as the boy crushed the tomato. 
And it wasn't one boy. It was hitter after hitter crushing the tomato with a big 
grin on their face.</p><p>
What changed? We didn't teach hitting technique so they were not better-skilled 
hitters. We didn't change their stance, nor did we alter their swing. It was the 
same group of kids with the same skill-level using the same old bat and ball. 
All of these factors were the same, but the results were drastically different.
</p><p>
What changed was a shift in the player's mindset. That shift changed their 
performance. For one, the kids had a visual in mind when they were hitting. And, 
that visual was something fun. It also had a little naughty in it. Wouldn't 
these kids get into trouble if they were crushing real tomatoes? Mom wouldn't 
like the mess! This real-life story was really Motivation 101 at its core.</p><p>
This same issue happens on sales teams every day. Sales people show up to work 
without really being there. They are there in body, but not in mind or spirit. 
They work the hours, collect a paycheck, and begin the process all over again. 
Whose fault is it that this culture exists in your company? In my mind, a leader 
is responsible for inspiring their team to perform. Their job is to inspire 
success! How many sales people on your team stop their swing as soon as they 
make contact with the ball? How many balls are sitting in the dirt a few feet 
from home plate?</p><p>
There are three reasons why the strategy with the Little Leaguers worked.</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>The motivation was fun</b>. Sure, technique is important, but that's not the only 
ingredient of the success recipe. Successful teams have leaders that motivate 
the group to want to excel. The team relies on its leader to make work fun. 
<br>
  <br>
  <i>Perspiration without inspiration leads to frustration. Inspired teams don't even 
notice that they perspire.<br>
&nbsp;</i></li>
  <li><b>They could visualize the metaphor</b>. When I spoke with the kids, I didn't toss 
out meaningless, trite expressions. &quot;Win one for the Gipper&quot; would not have 
worked with these kids. The tomato was a metaphor that created an image in their 
minds. I probably could have use a pi?ta and had the same effect. In either 
case, a picture was created in their mind that they could replicate.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>They had a focus for their energy</b>. As you can imagine, many of the fathers 
were bellowing at the kids; &quot;Lift your elbow!&quot; &quot;Turn your foot.&quot; &quot;Move your 
hands.&quot; None of those worked, just like yelling at workers to work harder 
doesn't yield productivity improvement. The &quot;crush the tomato&quot; expression gave 
them one thing on which to focus. We just wanted them to swing the bat as hard 
as they could without directly telling them to do it. We wanted them to swing 
the bat because they wanted to, not because they were told to do it. </li>
</ol>
<p>
These same three ingredients can be used as a motivation recipe in the 
workplace. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Pick a specific area of the business in which you desire an improvement in the 
results the sales team is producing.</li>
  <li>Create a fun program to inspire the team and create awareness of the issue.</li>
  <li>Develop visuals to promote the program. </li>
</ul>
<p>
One of the most rote sales functions is prospecting. Sales people, 
fundamentally, despise it, but every sales person needs to do it to be 
successful. Sales managers have an opportunity to reduce this pain and make the 
exercise fun. For example, create a team prospecting time where everyone makes 
calls at the same time. Have prizes for, not only the best results, but also the 
funniest story about a prospecting experience. Every sales person has one of 
those, if not a bunch of them.</p><p>
Years ago, I managed a lead creation channel that was underperforming. Yelling 
at the partners was not a prudent strategy. So, to get them up to snuff, I 
created a mock, fantasy football league where the channel partners played 
against one another each week. Points were awarded for different lead types and 
standings were kept for the season, and more importantly shared amongst the 
channel partners. They quickly forgot about lead generation and became focused 
on winning the championship. Needless to say, very quickly, we were drowning in 
qualified leads. </p><p>
Leadership, at its core, is about motivating a team to perform at levels they 
never dreamed possible. You see it in sports every day. The team that wins the 
championship isn't necessarily as skilled as the others, but they are driven to 
achieve. Get creative and inspire your team to crush the tomato! </p>
