The Sales Person&#8217;s Kryptonite</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Lee B. Salz</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="quote"><i>RFPs can leave you feeling powerless. Before you decide to respond to your 
next RFP, read this article. You can regain the power! </i> </p>
<p>Superman, as strong he is, is paralyzed by kryptonite. It brings him to his 
knees despite his superhuman strength. Sales people have their own kryptonite 
called RFPs, the dreaded Request for Proposal. An RFP process doesn&#8217;t have to be 
kryptonite. Superman has no choice but to fight this nemesis to survive. Sales 
people have choices.</p>
<p>For one, there is no law that says you have to respond to every RFP that 
crosses your desk. You have the right to say no. Some of you are now thinking 
that I&#8217;m insane, but it&#8217;s true. Let me turn the tables on you for a moment. The 
definition of insanity is repeating the same thing over and over again and 
expecting a different result. If you aren&#8217;t the low price provider and you have 
no relationship with the prospect, how can you possibly win the business? You 
can&#8217;t and won&#8217;t. Therefore, sending in countless RFP responses under these 
conditions will yield nothing but losses. So, who&#8217;s crazy now? </p>
<p>Sure, when the pipeline isn&#8217;t as full as it should be, it is a natural reflex 
to want to pursue every RFP you can get your hands on. Yet, filling out an RFP 
is work. It also has a cost to both you and your company. While you are working 
on an RFP which you have little chance of winning, you aren&#8217;t prospecting for 
business that has a much higher chance of award. Look, we all get the same 
number of hours in our day. What you elect to do with yours determines whether 
or not you are successful in sales. </p>
<p>A couple of things you should know about RFPs. First is that there is a 
disconnect between Procurement and their customers (called users). Often times, 
Procurement authors the RFP and establishes the measurement criteria for 
evaluating the submissions. However, when you speak to the actual user, they say 
that the criteria developed by Procurement is inconsistent with their needs. 
Thus, a supplier is selected for a user based on flawed criteria. </p>
<p>Another thing you should know is that an RFP is not necessarily a commitment 
to make a change in provider. Some companies require that they source the 
business every x amount of time. Ever wonder how that RFP got in your inbox? 
Procurement will surf the web and pick a handful of providers to whom they will 
send the RFP and off it goes. It helps to know that Procurement folks are 
measured on their ability to reduce cost to the company. Just like a sales 
person&#8217;s scorecard is based on achievement of their sales quota, Procurement&#8217;s 
quota is based on cost reduction. The RFP that arrived in your inbox could very 
well be their attempt to put the squeeze on the current provider so they can 
show a 10% savings. Don&#8217;t kid yourself. This happens a lot! </p>
<p>One final thing you should know about RFPs is that they are sometimes used as 
a manager tactic. For example, some people are too nice to tell you &#8220;no,&#8221; so 
they hide behind the statement that their company only buys through the RFP 
process. Don&#8217;t buy that for a second. No company exclusively buys this way. Even 
the Federal Government, who is the most formal buyer, does not limit their 
purchasing to this means. Sales people, present company included, sell products 
and services to the Feds without an RFP being issued. It can be done! </p>
<p>There is also a safety net for managers when they buy through RFPs as 
multiple people are involved in the selection process. If the supplier fails to 
perform, the finger can&#8217;t just be pointed at one person. During your needs 
analysis discussions, you can often get a feel for who really wants the RFP, the 
company or the person with whom you are meeting. Don&#8217;t underestimate the fear of 
blame. Many managers try to stay off the radar screen so they don&#8217;t want to 
create risk for themselves. </p>
<p>Dealing with an RFP where you have a relationship with the prospect is the 
subject of a future article. Keeping us focused on the blind ones, as I said 
before, you have choices. You could just respond to every RFP. Or, you could 
just chuck it in the trash. Care for a third option? What if you called the 
Procurement person and had a conversation that sounded like this, </p>
<p class="quote"><i>&#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m Lee Salz with XYZ Services. I just received your RFP in the mail and 
wanted to ask you a few questions so I can determine if it makes sense for us to 
respond. As you can imagine, we receive many RFPs and are very selective when 
determining to which we will respond.&#8221;</i> </p>
<p>With that said, one of a few things can happen. She could give you permission 
to ask your questions. Or she could say, &#8220;Fill out the RFP, or not. It&#8217;s up to 
you.&#8221; My vote is to decline any RFP where the Procurement person won&#8217;t allow you 
to ask questions of them. How can you have a fighting chance to win if they 
won&#8217;t speak with you? </p>
<p>With permission granted to ask questions, what is it you need to know to 
decide if it makes sense to participate in this process? </p>
<ol>
  <li>How did they get your name for inclusion in this process? </li>
  <li>Why is this 
RFP out now? </li>
  <li>Have they definitively decided to change providers? </li>
  <li>What 
criteria will be used to score the RFPs? </li>
  <li>What are the steps of the process 
after the RFP is submitted? </li>
</ol>
<p>Sure, there are a ton of other questions you could ask, but this information 
will best help you to determine if you have a chance at winning this account. 
The rule of thumb is that the less information Procurement shares, the lower the 
chance you have of winning. </p>
<p>Yes, walking away from the mega-deal is hard and painful. But is this deal 
real or simply a mirage? Watch any Superman movie and you will see that he 
overcomes his kryptonite peril. Will you overcome yours? </p>
