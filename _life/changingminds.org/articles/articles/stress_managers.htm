Stress and Managers</p>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Margaret Francis, MSW, M.Phil, PGDCIM</i></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Two men look through the prison bars; one sees the mud and 
the other see the stars.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">&#8220;A paradox of work life is that a situation can be seen by 
one person as a devastating threat, but by another as an invigorating 
challenge&#8221;, says Daniel Goleman. Job related stress among managers has been 
described as reaching epidemic. Stressful life is very common in our modern era, 
particularly in metropolitan cities. Stress in the work place has in fact, 
become a black plague of the twenty first century.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">There is converging evidence that most managers&#8217; reports 
feelings job related stress. Recently there has been increasing recognition of 
the potential positive out comes associated with job-related stress. Some 
managers perceive stress as leading to positive out comes. It is important to 
note that not all stress is bad, stress can result a competitive edge and force, 
positive changes. Job related stress associated with both positive and negative 
work out comes. Stress associated with two kinds of stress producing job demands 
or work circumstances described as challenges and hindrances.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Stress is found in all aspects of life. Hans Selye, a 
pioneer in stress research, has defined, as &quot;stress is the nonspecific response 
of the body to any demands made upon it&quot;. According to Oxford Dictionary &#8220;</span><span lang="EN-US">Stress 
is a state of affair involving demand on physical or mental energy&quot;.</span><span lang="EN-US">It 
is an internal state or reaction to which we consciously or unconsciously 
perceive as a threat, either real or imagined .Stress can produce feelings of 
frustration, fear, conflict, pressure,&nbsp; anger, sadness, inadequacy, guilt, 
loneliness, or confusion. Individuals feel stressed when they are fired or lose 
a loved one (negative stress) as well as when they are promoted or go on a 
vacation (positive stress). Individuals believe they must avoid stress to live 
longer. Most of the stress in modern society is distressful but stress may also 
have positive effect. Getting a job, getting married, etc. have a stimulating 
effect which results in personal growth. Selye suggests that we might call this 
Eustress or good stress.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">In the workplace, stress can affect performance. 
Individuals under too little stress may not make enough effort to perform at 
their best levels, while those under too much stress often are unable to 
concentrate or perform effectively and efficiently. The relationship between 
stress and performance is complex. Employers, however, have primarily been 
concerned about the rising costs of overstressed employees. Everybody suffers 
from stress. Relationship demands, physical as well as mental health problems, 
pressure at workplaces, traffic snarls, meeting deadlines, growing-up 
tensions&#8212;which leads stress. &nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN-US">Personal and Situational Factors</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Stress is affected by variety of personal and situational 
factors. Some people may take criticism of their work as a personal attack, 
become upset, and waste or lot of energy defending themselves. Yet other people 
may take similar criticism as a challenge to improve their work, there by 
experiencing less stress. A lot depends upon our personal make up. Many 
situational factors may contribute to our experience of stress. Lack of control 
or a feeling of futility in a stressful situation are key factors in stress.</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN-US">Reactions to stress</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Mainly there are two kinds of reactions to stress: 
Physical Reaction and Psychological Reactions</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">In <b>Physiological Stress reactions</b>, the general 
adaptation syndromes consists of three progressive stages such as alarm 
reactions, the stage of resistance and the stage of exhaustion.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The <b>alarm reactions</b> consists of complicated body 
and biochemical changes that produce similar symptoms regardless the type of 
stressor. The common symptoms are fever, headache, loss of appetite and 
generally tired feeling.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">In <b>stage of resistance</b>, the human organism develops 
an increased resistance to stressor. The alarm stage disappears and the body 
resistance rises above its normal level to cope up the continued stress. But 
this resistance includes increased secretions from various glands ,lowered 
resistance to infections and disease to adaptation. Stress induced peptic ulcers 
and high blood pressure are the common disorders induced by stress.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Chronic stress leads to the <b>stage of exhaustion</b>. 
Body defences break down, adaptation energy runs out and the physical symptoms 
of the alarm reaction reappear.</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN-US">Psychological Reactions</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-US">It consists of wide variety of cognitive, emotional, and 
behavioural response to stress. Most stress evoke anxiety-the vague, unpleasant 
feelings that some thing bad is about to happen. The most familiar psychological 
reactions to stress is <b>defence mechanisms</b> which protects oneself from 
perceived threat. Once a stressor has been interpreted as threatening, a variety 
of cognitive functions may be adversely affected. Stress also interferes with 
our judgement, problem solving and decision making. Stress also evokes a wide 
range of emotions, ranging from a sense of exhilaration, in the face of minor 
,challenging stressors to more familiar negative emotions of anger, fear, 
jealousy and discouragement. People behave under stress depends partially on the 
level of stress experienced. <b>Mild stress</b> energizes us to become more 
alert, active and resourceful. Moderate stress tends to have disruptive effect 
on our lives especially on complex behaviour. Under <b>moderate stress</b> 
people become less sensitive to their surroundings, easily irritated and more 
apt to relay on certain coping devices. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Experts tell us that stress, in moderate doses, are 
necessary in our life. Stress responses are one of our body's best defense 
systems against outer and inner dangers. In a risky situation</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Research suggests that stress can actually increase our 
performance. Instead of wilting under stress, one can use it as an impetus to 
achieve success. Stress can stimulate one's faculties to delve deep into and 
discover one's true potential.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">If approached positively, stress can help us evolve as a 
person by letting go of unwanted thoughts and principle in our life. Very often, 
at various crossroads of life, stress may remind you of the transitory nature of 
your experiences, and may prod you to look for the true happiness of life.</span><span lang="EN-US">
</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN-US">Job Stress </span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Job stress is a chronic disease caused by conditions in 
the workplace that adversely affect an individual's performance and/or overall 
well-being of his body and mind. One or more of a host of physical and mental 
illnesses manifests job stress. Stress can adversely affect an employee's 
performance. In the early stages job stress can enhance performance in the 
workplace, thus the term 'I perform better under pressure'. However, if this 
condition is allowed to go unchecked and the body is revved up further, the 
performance ultimately declines and the person's health degenerates.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Symptoms of job stress can be:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li><span lang="EN-US">Insomnia</span></li>
  <li><span lang="EN-US">Loss of mental concentration,</span></li>
  <li><span lang="EN-US">Anxiety, stress</span></li>
  <li><span lang="EN-US">Absenteeism</span></li>
  <li><span lang="EN-US">Depression</span></li>
  <li><span lang="EN-US">Substance abuse</span></li>
  <li><span lang="EN-US">Extreme anger and frustration, </span></li>
  <li><span lang="EN-US">Family conflict</span></li>
  <li><span lang="EN-US">Physical illnesses such as heart disease, migraine, 
  headaches, stomach problems, and back problems.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The causative factor of Job stress may be a complex set of 
reasons. Some of the most visible causes of workplace stress are:</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-US">Job Insecurity</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Organized workplaces are going through various changes and 
consequent pressures. Reorganizations, takeovers, mergers, downsizing and other 
changes have become major stressors for employees, as companies try to live up 
to the competition to survive. These reformations have put demand on everyone, 
from a CEO to a mere executive.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-US">High Demand for Performance</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Unrealistic expectations, especially in the time of 
corporate reorganizations, which, sometimes, puts unhealthy and unreasonable 
pressures on the employee, can be a tremendous source of stress and suffering. 
Increased workload, extremely long work hours and intense pressure to perform at 
peak levels all the time for the same pay, can actually leave employees 
physically and emotionally drained. Excessive travel and too much time away from 
family also contribute to an employee's stressors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-US">Technology</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The expansion of technology has resulted high expectations 
for productivity, speed and efficiency, increasing pressure on the individual 
worker to constantly operate at peak performance levels. Workers working with 
heavy machinery are under constant stress to remain alert. Both the worker and 
their family members live under constant pressure and mental stress. There is 
also certain factors which are forcing employees to learn new software all the 
times.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-US">Workplace Culture</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Adjusting to the workplace culture, whether in a new 
company or not, can be intensely stressful. Making one adapt to the new 
situation and other aspects of workplace culture such as communication patterns, 
hierarchy, dress code if any, workspace and most importantly working and 
behavioral patterns of the boss as well as the co-workers, can be a lesson of 
life. Maladjustment to workplace cultures may lead to subtle conflicts with 
colleagues or even with superiors. In many cases, office politics or gossips can 
be major stress inducers. Lack of motivation also affects his ability to carry 
out job responsibilities. </span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-US">Personal or Family Problems</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Employees going through personal or family problems which 
leads tensions and anxieties to the workplace.</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN-US">Job Stress and Women</span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Apart from the common job stress, women may suffer from 
mental and physical harassment at workplaces, Sexual harassment in workplace has 
been a major source of worry for women. A constant source of tension for women 
in job sectors like subtle discriminations at workplaces, family pressure and 
societal demands add to these stress factors.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The choice is between becoming a slave to the stressful 
situations of life or using them to our advantage. Because change is constant in 
life, stress is an integral part of it. Since we do not want to perish under it, 
we have to adhere to the bottom line for survival&#8212;adapt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span lang="EN-US">Tips to survive stress</span></h2>
<ul>
  <li><span lang="EN-US">Changing one's position more secure, and be prepared 
  for changes to avoid stress and survive in the competitive world.</span></li>
  <li><span lang="EN-US">re-energize and re-motivate yourself. Spend quality 
  time with your family. This can be an excellent source of emotional and moral 
  support.</span></li>
  <li><span lang="EN-US">Avoid using alcohol, smoking and other substance abuses
  </span></li>
  <li><span lang="EN-US">Develop positive attitudes towards stressful situations 
  in life. </span></li>
  <li><span lang="EN-US">In case of chronic stress consult a health 
  professional.</span></li>
  <li><span lang="EN-US">Adapting to demands of stress also means changing your 
  personality. Improve your line of communication, efficiency and learn from 
  other's experiences.</span></li>
  <li><span lang="EN-US">Breathing exercises. </span></li>
  <li><span lang="EN-US">Say kind &#8216;no&#8217; to additional commitments or 
  responsibilities</span></li>
  <li><span lang="EN-US">Avoid trying to achieve too much </span></li>
  <li><span lang="EN-US">Re-evaluate your goals and prioritize them</span></li>

  in with your goals</span></li>

</ul>

<h2><span lang="EN-US">Coping with Stress</span></h2>

<ul>
  <li><span lang="EN-US">Music therapy</span></li>
  <li><span lang="EN-US">Meditation</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Alleviating stress by altering our life style includes 
better stress tolerance; changing our pace of life, controlling distressful 
thoughts, acquisition problem solving skills and seeking social support. Apart 
from this identification of negative thoughts recurring often, invalidating 
negative thoughts by searching out life experiences contradicting them, 
Superimposing negative thoughts with positive thoughts, identifying one&#8217;s own 
strength and capacities. Believing that every solution or opportunity is 
preceded by crisis. Avoiding brooding over crisis like a stick in the mud, start 
developing action plan to deal with crisis.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The management of stress calls for inculcating an attitude 
of challenge to transform life&#8217;s eventualities to one&#8217;s advantage, with the 
commitment to attain certain values or goals of life, and the belief that one 
has the ability of control in diffusing threatening stressful events.</span></p>
