The Most Underutilized Strategic Advantage</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Lee B. Salz</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sales people are always looking for a way to differentiate themselves to win 
an account. Few use one of the most powerful tools in their bag, the right 
reference. </p>
<p>You have been chasing this account for six months and feeling optimistic as 
the buying process is coming to a conclusion. The sale is between you and two 
other firms. The competition is fierce, but you feel you are ahead. At 11am, the 
Procurement Agent asks for three references to be provided to her by the end of 
the day. In a panic, you send a company-wide email in search of these 
referenceable clients. At 4:58pm, you get the three references from your 
colleagues and quickly send them out to the Procurement Agent. Whew! Mission 
accomplished! They wanted three references and you got it done. And so did 
everyone else. You see the finish line, forgetting that many a sales person has 
fallen one step short of winning. </p>
<p>This scenario plays out in companies every day across the country. It doesn&#8217;t 
matter if the company is big or small, nor does it matter the type of industry. 
The request for references is a standard part of any buying process. However, 
few sales people use the reference stage of the process to their strategic 
advantage. They simply desire to provide a quick response to the prospect with 
their requested references. In the mind of the sales person, the speed of the 
response communicates supplier performance. While somewhat true, the discussions 
the prospect will have with the references carries more weight in the selection 
decision than the speed of the response from the potential supplier. </p>
<p>When I talk to sales people, one of their most common gripes is that they are 
selling a product that is viewed as a commodity in the marketplace. They cite 
&#8220;price&#8221; as their biggest bugaboo. Right behind that they lament about their 
inability to differentiate their product. (The truth is that price and 
differentiation are directly related, but that is a topic for another article.) 
When I ask sales people if they would like to learn of an easy way to get a 
competitive edge, they are all ears. After I share with them that they have the 
ability to differentiate themselves through managing the reference selection 
process, they look at me in shock as they can&#8217;t believe they have been missing 
this opportunity. Then the stories start to come out. &#8220;Yeah, I lost a deal 
because they called the reference and we had just screwed up their order. I 
should have checked before I used them&#8221; The stories just continue from there.
</p>
<p>But why do prospects ask for references? Webster&#8217;s defines &#8220;reference&#8221; as 
someone who can make a statement about a person&#8217;s qualifications, character, and 
dependability. Interestingly, there is a perception disconnect on references 
between sales people and prospects. When I talk to sales people, I usually hear 
that references are just a standard part of due diligence. Some use the term 
&#8220;rubber stamp&#8221; of an award. However, when I talk to buyers, I hear a very 
different message. Many buyers look at the reference step of the buying process 
as their opportunity to validate the message that they have been hearing from 
the potential supplier. In essence, prospects are searching to ascertain whether 
a supplier can deliver on the promises made during the buying process. Can the 
supplier really handle this size account? Are they really that fast? Or that 
accurate? Is the service as good as they described? </p>
<p>In many cases, the change of provider carries with it the ownership of the 
supplier&#8217;s performance. If the new supplier does not perform to the expectations 
that have been represented, there is risk for those who selected it. Heads will 
roll! Sometimes, prospects ask the same questions of the reference that they 
asked of the sales person to see if there is a difference in response. Other 
times, they ask specific questions relative to their needs that may not have 
been shared with the sales person. For the prospect, this is their most critical 
evaluation step of a supplier&#8217;s expected performance. </p>
<p>It is the little things that winning sales people do that makes them winners. 
So, if all of the competing sales people are going to provide &#8220;good&#8221; references, 
can you provide the &#8220;best&#8221; references? You most certainly can! However, there is 
a process to do so as &#8220;best&#8221; is different for each prospect.&#8221; </p>
<p>The first step is a conversation with the Procurement Agent. &#8220;I received your 
request for references and I&#8217;m happy to provide them. So that I can provide you 
with the references that best support your initiative, what are you hoping to 
learn from our clients?&#8221; If you can gather that information from the Procurement 
Agent (don&#8217;t say it can&#8217;t be done until you try it), you have the roadmap to 
identifying references. Even if they can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t provide you with this 
information, you have at least shown that you care. And &#8220;care&#8221; can be the 
differentiator that pushes you across the finish line. All is not lost if you 
can&#8217;t get that information either. </p>
<p>Going forward by taking a step back, think about the account and what is 
important to them. Reflect on what was learned during the needs analysis 
discussions. Thinking about that, imagine a different approach to responding to 
the request for references. If they were concerned about implementation, you 
provide an account that your company recently implemented. Perhaps, the decision 
is being made by a CFO, and you provide a reference of a CFO from one of your 
clients that can speak to your performance. For the third reference, you provide 
a client that is purchasing the same amount of the same product. From the 
prospect&#8217;s perspective, how great is the opportunity to speak to three clients 
who can relate to their needs. They are able to gather the information they 
desire from someone with whom they share something in common. They feel 
confident in their ability to perform due diligence on their potential supplier. 
They can make an informed decision. </p>
<p>To take it a step further, imagine rather than simply sending the contact 
names and phone numbers to that Procurement Agent, you provide a brief narrative 
explaining to what each client was serving as a reference. How many sales people 
are doing that? </p>
<p>Still raising the bar, imagine contacting each of the three references and 
informing them that a call was coming their way to discuss your performance as a 
supplier. During that call, you share that this prospect is calling to discuss 
particular areas of the business. Thus, when the prospect calls the reference, 
the reference is expecting the call and is prepared for the conversation. What a 
great experience for your prospect and your client. Keep in mind, one great way 
to burn a relationship with a happy client is to surprise them with a reference 
phone call. No one likes to be blind-sided or unprepared. I&#8217;ve seen more than a 
few opportunities lost where the prospect cited the reference experience as the 
deciding factor. An unprepared reference reflects negatively on the supplier.
</p>
<p>In a competitive marketplace, every opportunity that you have to demonstrate 
value to a prospect is critical. Leveraging the reference step of the process 
can give you just that little edge that pushes you over the top. </p>
