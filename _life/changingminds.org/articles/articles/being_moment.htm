<p><i>A new use for a wise old way of thinking</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>by: Andrew Burnham</i> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being in the moment is a mode where instead of reacting to events and people, 
we choose how we direct our attention and awareness of them, and respond. This 
saves time and energy and brings other business benefits. </p>
<h2>Getting out of your head </h2>
<p>Who has not been caught up by having their buttons pushed and reacting 
immediately, usually with less than an optimal outcome? Yes, they would prefer 
to be more responsive and creative. But reacting is a cycle. You might wonder 
why you so easily veer into feeling worked up, agitated, and stressed knowing 
that you would rather feel calm and centred, and focus on constructive action. </p>
<h2>What is &#8220;being in the moment&#8221; like? </h2>
<p>Being in the moment is the mode where action can flourish and stress is 
absent. Creative responses are more likely when we&#8217;re in the moment. 
Authenticity and thinking on one&#8217;s feet also come easily from his mode. When we 
are in the moment we are very powerful because we respond instead of react to 
challenging situations and people. </p>
<h2>Two Core Skills </h2>
<p>Being in the moment is comprised of two overarching skills. The first is 
awareness, and the second is attention. We are well aware of what is going on 
around us, but are hardly ever aware of how we process what is going on. A 
reactive cycle takes us out of the moment, so we&#8217;re less effective. Awareness of 
how we process what is going on is important for leaders and organizations 
because it saves time and energy. </p>
<h2>Awareness </h2>
<p>New, better responses to work, leadership and life arise naturally when we 
are first aware of what goes on &#8216;upstairs&#8217;. Our &#8216;doing&#8217; follows our state of 
being. Once a leader keys in on this awareness, s/he has a powerful mode to use. 
They reclaim their attention and can now direct it in purely constructive and 
creative ways. Awareness is a first step because we can control only those 
things that we are aware of. </p>
<h2>Reactions </h2>
<p>Once this awareness is generated, we notice that much time and energy is 
spent reacting to people and situations. A reaction is a conditioned way of 
processing the world. It is automatic and uncontrolled. When we say 'he/she 
really pushed my buttons' we are describing a reaction. Someone or something 
happened and we are now thinking in a way that is both uncontrolled and likely 
to lead to further agitation and stress. </p>
<h2>No Time to Think </h2>
<p>Some reactions, like the ones that get us out of harm&#8217;s way, are necessary to 
our survival. You saw a bus careening down the road and you leapt out of the 
way. Your mind reacted and you did not have time to become agitated or stressed 
about the bus careening down the road. You did not have time to think, &#8220;Oh, this 
is rather negative.&#8221; Or &#8220;Why does this always happen to me?&#8221; Your focus was 
simply on action. </p>
<h2>Being in this moment </h2>
<p>You were naturally in the moment. The external event was processed quickly 
enough that you created no blocks to action. Blocks to action happen when we 
process an external situation or person in a way that causes an internal problem 
for us. We know when we are turning an event or person into a problem when we 
take on stress, anger, anxiety or a host of other negative states. This is the 
true problem, as negative reactions waste time and energy. </p>
<h2>Conserve Time and Energy </h2>
<p>Unlike the split-second jump out of the way of a bus, there seems to be all 
sorts of time and energy available in our work days to create negative 
reactions. These block action as well as creative responses. They hinder 
relationships, and slowly turn promising people into puddles of anxiety. </p>
<h2>Attention </h2>
<p>Attention means the thing we are focusing on; what we are &#8216;thinking about&#8217;. 
With awareness, we have the opportunity to direct and control our thinking in a 
manner that yields the best results. </p>
<h2>Responding </h2>
<p>When we are responding, rather than reacting, we have the space in our mind 
to generate solutions, creative or otherwise, navigate easier through conflict, 
and be calm and centred under pressure. When we are responding we have choice. 
When we are reacting, there is no choice made. </p>
<p>There are simple and effective ways we can learn how to respond. </p>
<h2>Is &#8216;Normal&#8217; Working for You? </h2>
<p>Some of us think that it is only normal to react to challenging situations 
and people. Isn&#8217;t it just natural to have a negative reaction and get into a 
negative frame of mind when faced with certain people and certain situations? 
Isn't that just the way it is? Is the way you are reacting having a positive 
effect on your work? Does it help your interactions with others? Does stress add 
to the bottom line? Would you choose to be stressed if you knew you had the 
option not to be? No one would choose to be encumbered and hindered from 
achieving more and successfully taking on new challenges if they were aware they 
had a choice. </p>
<h2>Become a Scientist of your Own Mind </h2>
<p>Our mind is accustomed to thinking whatever its wants when it wants. At first 
it resists the mode called being in the moment. To get there and stay there, 
become like a scientist; keenly interested in getting to the truth of what is 
happening in your mind -- especially during difficult times. What are you 
focusing on? Do you have a choice? </p>
<h2>Watch where your focus goes </h2>
<p>A biologist observing the behaviour of seals doesn't get upset when some 
seals are gathering here and others are gathering there. She is just interested 
in what they do. She is not interested in what they should do. The only reason 
why she may be interested in what they should do is that it is different than 
what they were doing yesterday. Like the biologist, we first want to discover 
what is happening and make no judgments about what we think should be happening. 
Of course politicians should be honest, your food should arrive warm, your boss 
should appreciate you more, and so and so should be different. But then, these 
are not the real problems. Our &#8216;problems&#8217; come from what we focus on. </p>
<h2>Help Others </h2>
<p>What it would be like to be calm, centred and focused, despite what is 
happening on the outside? Isn&#8217;t this an essential tool for leaders, change 
agents and forward thinkers? Like the invention of the computer, would it help 
us do almost everything better? </p>
<h2>Management from the Inside </h2>
<p>As you learn to be more in the moment you will still take action, manage 
situations and people, plan, anticipate reactions, innovate and lead. All these 
management activities become easier, less stressful and more enjoyable when you 
are in the moment. You will also find that you are more creative and 
constructive in all of your activities. </p>
