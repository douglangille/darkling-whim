Understanding Needs Does Not Close a Sale</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This past week I placed 700 cold calls. That&#8217;s right. Seven hundred. Count 
&#8216;em. I have been seeking visionary sales training managers that have interest in 
licensing new program content (Buying Facilitation or Facilitating Buying 
Decisions) and it&#8217;s impossible to find visionaries through mainstream marketing. 
So I called. And called. </p>
<p>I learned a lot: 1. how I felt by 4:00 in the afternoon &#8211; exhausted, annoyed, 
mischievous, and vaguely victorious &#8211; as a telemarketer; 2. how sales leaders &#8211; 
VPs of Sales, Sales Managers, and Heads of Sales Training &#8211; perceive their level 
of success in relation to how they decide to add course titles; 3. how much 
willingness corporations have for exploring out-of-the-box material. </p>
<p>Interestingly, of the 200 people that I actually got to speak with, I heard 
the same thing over and over again: &#8220;We are Relationship Managers. We truly care 
about giving our customers great products, great service, and fair value. We 
take time to understand their needs before we introduce our products, and only 
offer product data if we think we can help.&#8221; All said with a somber tone to 
convey the basic belief that they teach the skills that exhibit care and 
connection, problem-solving and information gathering. I heard those sentiments 
close to 100% of the time. </p>
<p>Lovely. Except it doesn&#8217;t work. Each of them said that they were still 
closing less than 10% of their prospects (from first prospecting call to closed 
sale). Therefore, they must assume that what they are doing, and the 
commensurate results, is successful. So that&#8217;s what success looks like. </p>
<h2>Relationships don't create a purchase</h2>
<p>The real question is what is going on here? Wanting a real relationship with 
your customer and caring about their needs is like Mom and Apple Pie: you can&#8217;t 
argue with that sentiment. </p>
<p>But let&#8217;s get some reality here: </p>
<ol>
  <li>if that plan of action were successful, they&#8217;d be closing a lot more than 
under 10%.; </li>
  <li>everyone is doing the same thing. Every. One. That means that everyone is 
being nice-kind-smart-caring-service oriented. That means that you are no longer 
differentiated. And if you can&#8217;t differentiate by being 
nice-kind-smart-caring-service oriented, what does that leave? Two things: a. 
price. If everything looks the same, the only differentiator becomes price. b. 
personal preference. You have to find THAT prospect that you hit it off with 
really well (i.e. your selling patterns match her buying patterns). Yet if 
personality is the deciding factor, you better go out and visit lots of people 
to find those whose personality is similar to yours. </li>
  <li>understanding the buyer&#8217;s Identified Problem is only a small fraction of 
the route toward a buying decision, and a secondary one at that. Not to mention 
that the seller will never understand the full range of unique, internal issues 
the buyer needs to manage before being able to buy. Problem solving questions 
certainly don&#8217;t teach the buyer how to examine those areas beyond the bounds of 
the Identified Problem that have gotten them, and keep them, where they are at 
and would need to be reconfigured before change can take place. </li>
  <li>an outsider will never, ever understand the full range of elements that 
buyers live within: before they can make a purchasing decision they must manage 
and shift the elements that created their status quo, or Identified Problem. 
  </li>
  <li>sellers can&#8217;t have a &#8216;real relationship&#8217; with a prospect. It takes time, 
history, activity, and agreement of mutual benefit. Everyone knows that sellers 
begin &#8216;relationships&#8217; as a way to show the prospect that they are &#8216;nice&#8217;, 
trustworthy, able to sell product, and keep customers happy: there is no real 
&#8216;relationship&#8217; &#8211; certainly not one at the prospect phase that would cause a 
prospect to make a purchase from you, rather than another vendor, unless your 
price is as low as your competitor and they like you better. </li>
</ol>
<h2>It's bigger than understanding the problem</h2>
<p>To help you understand that there is a much larger picture operating here, 
let&#8217;s look at a prospect calling in with a very simple &#8216;need&#8217; that would be 
defined as an easy sale. </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you sell desktop computers. The buyer is calling for data to 
possibly purchase one computer for an in-house group of techies. Seems like a 
simple sale. The buyer goes away and will call you back. Given it appears so 
simplistic, what is he waiting for? Maybe the prospect has a political decision 
as to where to seat the new recruit &#8211; with the others in the tech department? or 
to break ranks and put the new person with the department that he&#8217;ll be working 
with? Maybe it&#8217;s a logistics decision: the prospect isn&#8217;t sure if the new person 
will get the new desktop, or take an old one, and one of the older programmers 
will get the new machine as a perk. Maybe there is a budget decision going on: 
who will pay for the computer - the tech department, the user department, or the 
R&amp;D department? </p>
<p>Are you getting the point here? Being able to sell the right computer at a 
good price and caring service is not the issue. Oh, certainly, it&#8217;s one of the 
issues that will help the final decision get made and help the prospect choose 
between vendors. But it&#8217;s not part of the foundational deciding factors. The 
prospect must first manage internal issues. </p>
<p>Even if you had some personal preferences to how they might manage their 
political, logistical, or financial decisions, you can&#8217;t make their decisions 
for them. Outsiders don&#8217;t have that type of power or credibility. Not to mention 
that even if the insiders shared the history of what has happened until the 
present, an outsider couldn&#8217;t manage the deep- seated politics and relationships 
that would need to be addressed. </p>
<p>Going for the Relationship, working at Problem Solving, and Understanding 
Needs doesn&#8217;t manage the buying decision process, although those skills will 
help with the final closing process. First your buyer must manage their internal 
issues and get buy-in. Otherwise, even bringing in something simple like a new 
computer can cause disruption. And the time it takes buyers to come up with 
their own answers is the length of the sales cycle. </p>
<p>Of course you care about your customers, but I think that means something 
different. For me, caring about your customers means helping them solve their 
business problem more efficiently. That&#8217;s all they want. They don&#8217;t want your 
relationship. They don&#8217;t want your product. They don&#8217;t want you. They merely 
want to solve a business problem. </p>
<p>Helping buyers attempt to resolve a problem by Problem Solving and 
Relationship Management and Understanding Needs is your way of Placing Product. 
It&#8217;s not caring about your customer. </p>
<h2>Helping buyers choose you</h2>
<p>Surely there must be easier ways for buyers to choose you than to try to 
convince them that you, better than the others attempting to do the same thing, 
are their Relationship Partner. </p>
<p>Sales, as a model, has been used to Place Product and Problem Solve. The 
means to do this has been to Understand Needs. You&#8217;ve gotten extremely good at 
doing these things and your company has done a great job giving you good, 
branded, well-positioned and priced product to sell. But you are still closing 
only a fraction of the sales you deserve to close. </p>
<p>Why not use sales as a means to support the buyer&#8217;s decision making? </p>
<p>Until now, having unbiased tools to help your buyer manage their own 
internal, idiosyncratic, systems-based decisions (that have actually created the 
Identified Problem as it appears) has not been part of the sales model, nor has 
it been in the consciousness of the industry. The entire industry has assumed 
that if a seller can find the right prospect, with the right problem that fits 
with your solution, there should be a match. </p>
<p>You have been trained to ask great questions to Understand the Problem, but 
you fail to recognize that you are asking biased questions as if the Identified 
Problem is an isolated event. It would be like asking what the person in the 
computer example above what she would do with the computer or how much memory is 
needed, but not asking how she&#8217;d know to choose one provider over another given 
that competing products were so similar. </p>
<p>With just a few Facilitative Questions up front, you can easily direct the 
buyer to all of his decisions, prior to discussing product or needs. Now, you
</p>
<p>can&#8217;t go any further than the data you are being given. And let&#8217;s face facts: 
your questions are biased toward solving what your product can resolve, and your 
questions don&#8217;t help the buyer recognize the full range of issues they encounter 
every day within the system they live within (the people, policies, 
relationships, strategies, vendor criteria, etc.). </p>
<h2>Facilitate the decision process before offering solution</h2>
<p>Buying Facilitation codes the process that buyers must go through as they 
make the necessary decisions to seek an external solution. It&#8217;s not problem 
solving, product placement, or understanding needs. It&#8217;s decision facilitation 
and a different part of the sales process to the one you&#8217;re currently focusing 
on. </p>
<p>Until or unless a buyer can recognize and manage their internal elements that 
created the problem and that hold it in place, they cannot make a purchasing 
decision. It would be like giving a youngster a brand new car the day following 
a drunken smash-up: until you all get to the root cause and learn how to manage 
the Identified Problem through change, any attempt to resolve the situation 
would create more disaster. And finding out what type of car the kid needs is 
moot until that happens. </p>
<p>Buying Facilitation will give you the vehicle to be a real Relationship 
Manager. What elements created and maintain the status quo? What is keeping it 
in place? What has stopped it from being resolved already? Who needs to lead the 
internal &#8216;pack&#8217; toward the new behaviors or decisions they will need to make to 
adopt something new? The buyer needs to know the answers to these questions. You 
don&#8217;t. </p>
<p>The most difficult thing for you is to recognize that the prospect needs to 
Understand the Problem. You need to act as a neutral navigator through their 
examination process at the front end of the sales process. First support the 
buying decision, then problem solve, understand, and place product as you 
support the product decision which will naturally follow. </p>
<p>You knowing how the problem got where it is now will not help the buyer make 
the internal shifts necessary toward resolution: </p>
<p>You can&#8217;t make the buyer&#8217;s decision for him; </p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have the internal relationships, the history, the team trust to 
effect change. </p>
<p>You are an outsider, and until you are hired by the prospect, you will never 
fully understand anything more than the area immediately around the Identified 
Problem. </p>
<p>You won&#8217;t be able to tell the CEO that he hired the wrong people, or needs to 
shift departments heads, etc. unless you are an Executive Coach and are paid to 
do this; </p>
<p>You won&#8217;t be able to address the entire decision team and get them to change 
direction, disconnect relationships, or fire the current vendor unless you are 
an internal change-management consultant getting paid to do this. </p>
<p>Unfortunately for you, the buyer just has to do this part alone. But you can 
help define the structure of the process for them. Not to mention that the buyer 
will have all of the answers and then be able to make a purchasing decision in 
half the time, without a price criterion. You helping the buyer know these 
things for himself will encourage the trust you have been seeking by Problem 
Solving, Understanding Needs, and Placing Product. </p>
<p>Add Buying Facilitation to your skill set. Start with the ebook Buying 
Facilitation: the new way to sell that expands and influences decisions as a way 
to understand all of the decisions buyers need to make before they&#8217;ll buy. 
Consider taking a training that will teach you how to help buyers make and 
manage their decisions. Then add the new skill to your sales model. It will give 
you the ability to manage the sales cycle as an outsider who has both the skill 
and care to be a real Relationship Manager. </p>
<p>Would you rather sell? Or have someone buy?</p>
