5 Keys to Hiring the Right Sales Manager</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Lee B. Salz </i> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>There are few decisions more critical for a company than the hiring of the 
leadership of their sales organization. Yet, few know how to do it well. Many 
err and &#8220;promote&#8221; their best seller to a sales management position. Why this is 
called a promotion is beyond me. The job of the sales manager is vastly 
different than that of a sales person, so why is this considered employment 
elevation? Often times, sales managers earn less than the top sales people. 
Promotion? </p>
<p>Some sales people make the transition successfully, but many struggle with 
the change. Sometimes, it is a mismatch of the person to the role. However, more 
frequently, the struggle is caused by the lack of recognition by the company 
that this is not a promotion, but rather a move into a completely new job. How 
do you handle an employee in a new job? You train, mentor, and monitor their 
performance! Look, most people don&#8217;t come out of the womb with the skills 
required to be an effective manager. Thus, it is a key responsibility of the 
company to recognize that when moving their top sales person into that role they 
need to own the development of that individual. A congratulatory handshake and 
smile just won&#8217;t get it done. </p>
<p>Many companies look for their sales management candidates from outside their 
organization. This approach also has its challenges. Whether you promote from 
within or hire from outside, consider these five points to make sure you find 
the right person for the role. </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Selling versus Managing</b>. If you consider the broad spectrum of 
responsibilities from selling business directly to managing a team, what 
percentage of the time do you expect this person to be focused on personal 
selling versus managing? As mentioned above, the skill set required for those 
two responsibilities is vastly different. It is also difficult to find 
professionals that have equal strength in both skill sets. Often times, there 
will be a trade-off. If there is a sacrifice to be made, it makes the best sense 
to select someone who has their primary strength in the more predominant part of 
the responsibility.<br>
  <br>
  If the decision is made that the position has equal responsibility for 
selling and managing or the dominant responsibility is selling, it may make 
sense for an internal hire. This allows the company to develop a new manager. 
However, the plan falls down if the company is not committed to a development 
plan.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Creating versus Executing</b>. Another consideration is what your expectations 
of the sales manager are relative to developing the company&#8217;s sales 
architecture? (the framework of the sales organization). In some companies, 
there is a plan already in place and the job of the sales manager is to ensure 
the plan is executed as written. In essence, the job is to motivate the troops 
and coach them to make sure revenue targets are achieved. This is usually the 
case for mid-level sales managers. <br>
  <br>
  In other situations, the primary job is to establish the overall direction of 
the sales organization, formulate the compensation plan that supports that 
direction, and execute the plan. Needless to say, this is a very different 
profile than the sales manager described above. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Title versus Responsibility</b>. Check any job board and you will find a 
plethora of titles referring to sales management. However, there is not a direct 
correlation between title and responsibilities. This can create a disconnect 
with the new manager and with clients if those two are not synchronized. If you 
are going to give someone the title of &#8220;Vice President,&#8221; there is an inherent 
expectation that this is a high-responsibility, high-authority position. When 
clients hear that title, they believe that this person is a senior-level person 
in the company and can make decisions. Thus, this can create client frustration 
if the responsibility and authority are not consistent with the title. <br>
  <br>
  At the other end of the spectrum, calling this person a &#8220;sales manager&#8221; 
creates a more junior-level perception. There is nothing wrong with the term, 
but it is important that you recognize the created perception. Again, this can 
cause issues with both the person in the role and clients if the 
responsibilities don&#8217;t match the title. Some very good sales management 
candidates will elect not to apply to your company because they believe it is a 
junior-level role. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Interviewing</b>. Probably the toughest role for which to interview is the 
sales manager. For one, they are experienced in interviewing. They know the 
desired answers. They know the sales lingo and buzz words. How do you get past 
the fluff and get your real answers? One way is to develop a list of benchmark 
questions that candidates are asked. This allows for comparison of answers among 
the candidate pool. (Send me an email and I will send you my favorite 20 
questions.) It is important that the questions not follow a sequence so that the 
candidate cannot build off their prior answers. Be sure to document the 
responses to each so you can review them later. You will be amazed by what comes 
out of this step of the process. <br>
  <br>
  Another important consideration when interviewing these candidates is with 
whom they will need to have a healthy business relationship to be successful in 
their role. For example, there is an inherent strife between sales and 
operations. However, the company will fail if the leaders of those two areas are 
not able to work together in a productive manner. Consider the various 
department leaders with whom this person will interact and engage them in the 
process. This also helps the new manager assimilate into the organization once 
they are onboard.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>The Ultimate Screening Tool</b>. The most effective tool that I have found in 
screening sales management candidates is the request for the submission of a 
written business plan. When the candidate has satisfactorily completed all of 
the other steps of the pre-offer process, the request is made for a one-page 
business plan that shows how they would approach the job. I mention the one-page 
scope three times in the conversation so my expectations are clear. The 
candidate is asked by when they can submit the document. It is important that 
the submission date be asked of the candidate, not the other way around as you 
will see in a moment. <br>
  <br>
  The benefits of this step are numerous. For one, it shows if the candidate 
can communicate in written form. Writing is a lost art in business, but a 
critical one for someone in a leadership role. <br>
  <br>
  Another benefit is that it shows if the candidate understands what the role 
entails. A number of hours have been spent with the candidate by this point. If 
they are near the finish line, they should have a clear vision of the 
expectations. <br>
  <br>
  Another is to see if there is a synergy in the approach to the role. It is 
best to see before the marriage is performed if their approach is aligned with 
the leadership&#8217;s vision.<br>
  <br>
  Still another is the ability to see if this person can meet a self-imposed 
deadline. I asked when he could have the plan to me. He provided me with a date 
and time. If it is late, the candidate is no longer considered for employment. 
End of story. <br>
  <br>
  Finally, in this role, I am the client. I&#8217;ve asked for a one-page plan, not 
an epic. Do they follow directions? Or do they ignore what the client desires 
and do whatever they want. While I don&#8217;t eliminate candidates solely for this, I 
refer to this in a follow-up session with the candidate. </li>
</ul>
<p>One final point that is critical when hiring is to background screen. Resume 
fraud is at an all-time high! Candidates lie about employment history, salary 
history, and their education experience, not to mention criminal history. Find a 
reputable firm to do this work for you. </p>
<p>Finding the right person for your sales management role is difficult. It is 
also expensive. These five keys will help mitigate the risk and create a happy, 
healthy sales marriage between you and your new employee. <br>
