Techniques of Persuasive Communication: Old Wisdom in a New Package</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Philip Yaffe </i> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you are about to read will probably sound familiar. Indeed, it has been 
said many times before. However, I believe this formulation is original and may 
help you better apply it in your marketing communication. I immodestly call it 
Yaffe&#8217;s Law. </p>
<h2>Yaffe&#8217;s Law </h2>
<p>If you give people <u><b>what they want first</b></u>, then they are likely to accept 
anything else you want them to have. If you give them <u><b>what you want first</b></u>, 
chances are they won&#8217;t accept anything at all. </p>
<p>This is simply the classic principle that you should write from the reader&#8217;s 
point of view. And of course we all do this. Or do we? </p>
<p>How often do we interpret writing from the reader&#8217;s point of view as telling 
people: &#8220;What I have to say will be of benefit to you, so you should pay close 
attention&#8221;? When we do this, we are in fact writing from our point of view, not 
theirs. We may sincerely believe that our message is important and beneficial to 
our potential readers. But unless they agree&#8212;and agree almost immediately&#8212;the 
argument is lost. </p>
<p>We have all been guilty of such self-serving logic, and some of us do it more 
often than we would like to imagine. This is why this new formulation of the 
classic principle is potentially so useful. It forcefully reminds us that the 
readers are king. And like royalty they must be served first. Only after readers 
have sampled what we have on offer and find it palatable will they be truly 
inclined to listen to what we want to say. Assimilate it. And hopefully act on 
it. </p>
<p>The power of Yaffe&#8217;s Law lies in the fact that it is more than just a 
reminder. It is in fact a formula for ensuring that you will always write from 
the reader&#8217;s point of view. The trick is first to apply the formula, then check 
how well you have applied it&#8212;and, if necessary, reapply it. </p>
<p>The formula consists of three steps: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Determine what your readers really want to know, rather than what you want 
to say. </li>
  <li>Give this to them--first. </li>
  <li>Link what you want to say to what they 
really want to know. </li>
</ol>
<p>Here are a few examples of how Yaffe&#8217;s Law works in practice. </p>
<h2>Corporate Image Brochure </h2>
<p>I was once commissioned to write a corporate image brochure. Two things are 
certain about these expensive, glossy booklets: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Almost all companies of any size feel compelled to produce them. </li>
  <li>Virtually no one ever reads them. </li>
</ul>
<p>By applying the formula, I created a brochure that people not only read. They 
called the company to request additional copies to give to friends, clients and 
professional colleagues! </p>
<p>How? I started from the assumption that no one would want to read anything 
about the company itself. So I asked myself: <i>What things does the company do 
that people might really want to read about?</i> </p>
<p>The company&#8217;s basic activity was producing vaccines. We are all naturally 
interested in health and virtually everyone knows the importance of vaccination. 
Here were already two things people might want to read about. </p>
<p>I was able to define seven areas of the company&#8217;s activities that could be 
naturally attractive to potential readers. However, it didn&#8217;t stop there. If all 
this interesting information were mixed up with company publicity, people would 
still probably not read it despite their natural inclination to do so. </p>
<p>The brochure was therefore laid out in seven double-page spreads, i.e. each 
of the seven areas of activity would be allotted two facing pages. However, the 
text would be rigorously segregated. </p>
<h3>&#8226; Theory </h3>
<p class="quote">The left side would be pure science; the company&#8217;s name would never be 
mentioned. </p>
<h3>&#8226; Practice </h3>
<p class="quote">The right side would explain how the company used the science to produce 
vaccines. </p>
<p>In short, I gave the readers what they wanted first (scientific information), 
then what the company wanted them to have second (company information). </p>
<p>When I proposed this to the company, the reaction was one of shock. &#8220;You mean 
people could read the brochure left side only and never ever see our name?&#8221; 
Exactly. But having learned about the basic science, wouldn&#8217;t they naturally 
want to learn how the company was using the science? </p>
<p>It took a while for management to accept the idea, but finally they did. When 
the brochure was ready, they couldn&#8217;t print enough of them. </p>
<p>Of course, not all companies would be suitable for this particular type of 
corporate image brochure. The important thing here is not the specific structure 
of this specific brochure, but the thinking process that led to it. </p>
<h2>Stand Specific Video </h2>
<p>I have done considerable work for pharmaceutical companies. This often 
included attending medical congresses. The first couple of times I did this, I 
noted something strange. </p>
<p>Pharmaceutical companies regularly erect exhibition stands to inform 
specialist doctors about new drugs and new applications of older drugs. I noted 
that many of the stands had several video monitors at their edges running 
videotapes. I observed the behavior of the doctors. The vast majority of them 
watched the tape for only a minute or two, then went away. </p>
<p>I asked an international marketing director why he was using these monitors 
and tapes. &#8220;To attract attention to our stand,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But the doctors stay 
in front of the monitor only a couple of minutes, then leave.&#8221; &#8220;Yes, but they 
were attracted to our stand. They know we are here and may come back.&#8221; </p>
<p>Frankly, this didn&#8217;t make much sense to me, but being young and inexperienced 
I accepted it. A couple of years later, when I felt I knew better what I was 
doing, I made a suggestion. </p>
<p>The videotapes ran anywhere from 10 - 15 minutes, then automatically 
recycled. The problem was, doctors who began watching after the tape had started 
never knew how long they would have to wait for it to finish and restart. 
Moreover, hardly any were likely to stand in front the video monitor for 15 
minutes or more, even if they had known how long the presentation was. </p>
<p>The tapes were so long because they had not been conceived for medical 
congresses, but for a totally different purpose. They were used simply because 
they already existed. </p>
<p>I suggested making a &#8220;stand-specific videotape&#8221;, which would concentrate all 
key information about the company&#8217;s product into no more than 90 seconds. The 
fact that the tape ran only 90 seconds and then automatically recycled would be 
prominently posted, so that the doctors would know exactly how much time they 
were being asked to invest in it. </p>
<p>Consider the benefits: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Virtually all doctors who started to watch the tape stayed for it to 
recycle. </li>
  <li>Because they got all the key points, many who wanted more detailed 
information immediately came onto the stand. </li>
  <li>Those who were interested but were short of time probably came back later. 
  </li>
  <li>Even those who were not certain they were interested nonetheless went away 
with a complete picture of what the company&#8217;s product was all about. </li>
</ol>
<p><b>In short, <u>virtually 100% effectiveness!</u></b><u> </u> </p>
<p>There was no way to gauge the effectiveness of the previous system. But if it 
had been as much as 10%, I would have been shocked. </p>
<h2>Interactive Stand Animation System </h2>
<p>Another thing I noticed at medical congresses. Doctors would come onto the 
stand, pick up the brochures and scientific papers, put them in the congress 
bags, then move on to the next stand and do the same thing. The problem is, 
pharmaceutical companies could never really tell if doctors actually read the 
materials they take away. Estimates are that up 95% of it ends up in the hotel&#8217;s 
wastepaper basket without ever being opened. </p>
<p>Using the method of Yaffe&#8217;s Law, a few years ago a colleague and I created 
what we call the Interactive Stand Animation System. It is applicable not only 
to medical congresses, but virtually every other kind of professional trade 
show. </p>
<p>There is not room here to describe how it works, but I can tell you its 
results. </p>
<p>With this system, you are certain that your brochures, data sheets, etc., are 
being read, because people read them right in front of you on the stand. Even 
better, they actually study the documents, then discuss, debate and compare 
notes with their colleagues. At the same time, they provide you with valuable 
market research information that would be difficult to obtain in any other way. 
This can be very important for determining the best ways of presenting your 
products, which features to emphasis, which aspects may require change for later 
versions, etc. </p>
<p>I once described this system to the international marketing director of a 
major pharmaceutical company. He was very sceptical. Basically he said: &#8220;I have 
been in this business for nearly 30 years and I have attended dozens and dozens 
of medical congresses. What you are telling me just isn&#8217;t possible.&#8221; He 
maintained this position until he went to a congress where we were running the 
system for another company. His reaction: &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen it, but I still don&#8217;t 
believe it. I never would have imagined anything like this could possibly be 
true.&#8221; </p>
<p>But it was. </p>
