competition.&nbsp;Proper management &nbsp;is vital in these complex environments.&nbsp;The 
quality of manager and effective management styles can determine the culture of

Managers develop their own leadership qualities and those of others. Management 
utilises planning, organisational and communications skills.&nbsp; These skills are 
important in leadership also, but even more so are qualities such as integrity, 
honesty, courage, commitment, sincerity, passion, determination, compassion and 
sensitivity.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">There are certain other qualities required for a good 
manager to manage his staff.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-US">Planner</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-US">A Manager has to take a long-term view; while a team 
member will be working towards known and established goals, the manager must 
look further ahead so that these goals are selected wisely. By thinking about 
the eventual consequences of different plans, the manager selects the optimal 
plan for the team and implements it. The manager ensures that work is not 
repeated nor problems tackled too late, and that the necessary resources are 
allocated and arranged. </span></p>
<h3>Provider</h3>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The Manager has access to information, which the team 
needs. The role of a manager is important because authority, which the manager 
holds uniquely within the team and the manager, must exercise the power for the 
benefit of the team for the effective productivity. </span></p>
<h3>Protector</h3>
<p style="background: white"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;In any company, there are 
problems, which can deflect the work force. The manager should be there to guard 
against these and to protect the team. If a new project emerges which not given 
an impossible deadline. If someone in your team brings forward a good plan, you 
must ensure that it receives a fair hearing and that your team knows and 
understands the outcome. If someone is in your team has a problem at work, you 
have to deal with it.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-US">Inspires a S</span>h<span lang="EN-US">ared Vision</span></h3>
<p style="background: white"><span lang="EN-US">An effective manager is often 
described as having a vision of where to go and the ability to articulate it.
</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN-US">Qualities of a Manager</span></h2>
<h3><span lang="EN-US">Good </span>Communicator</h3>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The ability to communicate with people is the most 
important skill by managers and team members. The Manager is also the team's 
link to the larger organisation. He must have the ability to effectively 
negotiate and use persuasion when necessary to ensure the success of the team 
and project. Through effective communication, manager support individual and 
team achievements by creating guidelines for accomplishing tasks and for the 
career advancement of team members.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-US">Enthusiasm</span></h3>
<p style="background: white"><span lang="EN-US">If Managers are negative - they 
bring staffs down. Manager with enthusiasm, with a bounce in their step, with a 
can-do attitude. Many people tend to follow people with a can-do attitude. 
Enthusiastic Managers are committed to their goals and express this commitment 
through optimism.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-US">Competence</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Managers will be chosen based on their ability to 
successfully lead others rather than on technical expertise, as in the past. 
Having a winning track record is the surest way to be considered competent. 
Expertise in management skills is another dimension in competence. The ability 
to challenge, inspire, enable, model and encourage must be demonstrated if 
managers are to be seen as capable and competent.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-US">Ability </span>to<span lang="EN-US"> Delegate Tasks</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Trust is an essential element in the relationship of 
manager and his or her team. You demonstrate your trust in others through your 
actions - how much you check and control their work, how much you delegate and 
how much you allow people to participate. </span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-US">Cool Under</span> <span lang="EN-US">Pressure </span>
</h3>
<p><span lang="EN-US">In a perfect world, projects would be delivered on time, 
under budget and with no major problems or obstacles to overcome. A leader with 
a hardy attitude will take these problems in stride. When leaders encounter a 
stressful event, they consider it interesting, they feel they can influence the 
outcome and they see it as an opportunity. </span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-US">Team-</span>Building<span lang="EN-US"> Skills</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-US">A team builder can best be defined as a strong person who 
provides the substance that holds the team together in common purpose toward the 
right objective. In order for a team to progress from a group of strangers to a 
single cohesive unit, the leader must understand the process and dynamics 
required for this transformation. He or she must also know the appropriate 
leadership style to use during each stage of team development. The leader must 
also have an understanding of the different team players styles and how to 
capitalise on each at the proper time, for the problem at hand.</span></p>
<h3>Communicate<span lang="EN-US"> the big picture</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;If you want your employees to work hard and be committed 
to your business, you have to keep them in the loop. Open communication helps 
foster loyalty and gives employees a sense of pride. It helps them understand 
how their work contributes to the company's success.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-US">Delegate work and responsibilities</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Some employees, share their 
workload with them and assign the work according to people's strengths and 
weaknesses, and let employees develop their own good work habits and abilities.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-US">Help employees set goals</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Setting deadlines and goals 
helps keep employees focused, busy and motivates them to do their work. Talk to 
each of your employees about the company's goals, and work with them to set 
individual goals directly linked to your business's mission. Make sure employees 
understand their professional growth path in the company.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-US">Recognize problems</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-US">It is impossible to know about 
personality conflicts, lagging productivity or other problems in the office if 
you have your head in the sand. If you notice a change in an employee's work 
habits or attitude, try to get to the root of the problem before it starts 
affecting the rest of your staff.</span></p>
<h2><span lang="EN-US">Effective dealing of Problems </span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The first step in dealing with a problem employee is to 
identify the trouble. Many times, a simple, honest talk with an employee will 
dissolve issues such as occasional tardiness or minor attitude problems. 
Coaching requires a manager to work one-on-one with problem employees or to 
assign another employee to work with the employee to overcome their 
shortcomings. The mentor should provide the employee with feedback and solutions 
for improving their performance. Coaching requires patience and a substantial 
time investment, but it can help modify an employee's behavior. </span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-US">Poor performance</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Poor performance is not always due to a 
lack of skills; the employee may simply be disorganized or sloppy. These habits 
can usually be corrected with proper guidance. If performance difficulties 
relate to a lack of skills, consider coaching or additional training. </span>
</p>
<h3><span lang="EN-US">Job incompatibility</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-US">In some cases an employee becomes a 
problem because their skills aren't compatible with their assigned tasks or 
regular duties. In this case, offering the employee additional training or 
assigning them a different set of tasks is usually the most appropriate course 
of action.</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-US">Sloppy work</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-US">When you notice that, an employee has made 
some errors, point out the mistakes to the employee and monitors their work more 
closely. If the problem persists, speak with the employee and detail the most 
serious examples of problems with their work. Remember to remain positive and 
focus on how important the employee's contribution is to the company. </span>
</p>
<h3><span lang="EN-US">Create an effective message</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Consider the specific 
informational needs of executives, middle managers, supervisors and employees, 
and tailor your message to fit each audience. An effective message should also 
explain how your employees´ day-to-day duties directly affect the company's 
performance and should touch on the values and pride of the employees. A direct, 
face-to-face interaction can help reinforce positive attitudes inspire employees 
and help them adapt to the change. </span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-US">Listen to your employees</span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Employee feedback is critical in 
managing change. Holding focus groups with employees is a great way to gauge 
reaction and monitor the progress of change. You also can encourage employees to 
provide feedback through email or the company intranet. Communication is the 
cornerstone to successful change management. Talking to your employees is not a 
one-time event, and you need to reinforce your message by communicating early 
and often. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span lang="EN">To be an effective manager you must know yourself, your 
strengths and your weaknesses, and those of the people around you.&nbsp; You must 
know your objectives and have a plan of how to achieve them.&nbsp; You must build a 
team of people that share your commitment to achieve those objectives, and you 
must help each team member to achieve their best which will be able to attain a 
common goal.</span></p>
