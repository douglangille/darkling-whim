<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="../articles.htm">Guest articles</a> &gt; Masterful Time Management</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Louis Lautman</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its eleven o&#8217;clock and you realize that you didn&#8217;t get everything done that 
needed to get done for the day and you must be awake at six-thirty to be on time 
for work tomorrow at eight am. You go to bed and toss and turn thinking about 
all the things that you forgot to do during the day and are tired when you wake 
up the next day because of your lack of sleep. This is just another day in your 
life, looking like all of the preceding ones. When does it stop? It will stop 
when you decide it stops, hopefully after reading this article.</p><p>
Why do some people accomplish more in a day than some of us do in a week? And 
some of us accomplish more in a month than others in an entire year? We all have 
the same twenty-four hours in a day, so how can some people do magic with these 
twenty-four hours while others watch in awe? The answer is masterful time 
management. </p><p>
You must learn to tend to business, not to busyness. Place more value on results 
and less on putting in time or effort. If your goal is to produce x number of 
widgets in y amount of time, is your time most effectively spent putting 
together the widget, or can you delegate the assembly of the widgets and earn 
more money doing something else. You must focus on your highest pay off 
activities. There is the old story of jar and you have to put in a bunch of 
rocks, gravel, sand and water. In what order do you put them in the jar? Well if 
you put in the water first, then the sand, followed by gravel and finally the 
rocks, chances are you won&#8217;t be able to fit the rocks. If you reversed the 
order, everything would fit nicely in the jar.</p><p>
What does this story have to do with time management, everything, if you do 
things in their order of importance (big rocks first) everything fits nicely 
into your day and the smaller less urgent and less important things tend to fit 
in just as nicely. So the story was great, but Louis, I need help, put it to me 
in English&#8230;right? OK, there are three important keys to masterful time 
management.</p><p>
The first key to Masterful Time Management is to prioritize. Why do so many 
people say &#8220;Well, I would do that, but it is just not a priority now&#8221; or &#8220;When I 
find the time I will get around to that.&#8221; You must decide what is a priority and 
what is not. You must also not hope to find the time, you must make the time. To 
begin get out a sheet of paper and list all the things that you must do in the 
next year, month, week and day.</p><p>
Under each place an A, B, C, or D next to each where A is the most important 
thing that must get done and D being the least important. Your list may have 
just a few items or be many pages long, however long it is, is ok. This will 
tell you what you must do and after a while of mastering your time, you will be 
able to do a lot more in less time.</p><p>
Look at each item and write a plan on how each of these activities is going to 
get done. This will be like an instruction manual for your life or like the 
recipe for a great meal. Please make sure that the steps are spelled out, 
because if things are not done in the correct order, rarely can we run before we 
can walk.</p><p>
This brings us up to our next step in the process which is delegation. 
Delegation is simply assigning a task to another to have completed. What do you 
delegate and what do you do on your own? I once heard someone say &#8220;The less I do 
the more I make.&#8221; Well if you do not like mowing your lawn and you make thirty 
dollars an hour and the kid down the street will mow your lawn for twenty 
dollars, I would suggest working an extra hour and give the kid his twenty to 
mow your lawn. Not only do you help the economy, but you are also helping 
yourself manage your time effectively. Never step over a dollar to pick up a 
dime. That is why the wealthy can afford to have someone cooking their food, 
cleaning their clothes and taking care of their house. It is just not cost 
effective for them to do it themselves, they would be taking from the economy to 
do these things themselves. Support your local economy and figure out what is 
worth you time and what is not. How do you figure out what your time is worth? A 
good gauge is how much do you make per hour? A better gauge is how much do you 
want your time to be worth&#8230;and do the things that someone whose time is worth 
that much would do. Don&#8217;t forget, people are in business to serve you and those 
who think govern those who labor. Are you a thinker or a laborer?</p><p>
You&#8217;ve prioritized your activities, you&#8217;ve delegated the things that are not 
worth your time to do, now for the third key to masterful time 
management&#8230;scheduling. &#8220;I have a date book&#8221; you say. Keep it in the drawer 
because the following will revolutionize your day to come. Go back to your list 
of things to get done for the next day, week, month and year. Begin with all the 
things that have A&#8217;s next to them and work on them until they are complete 
before you work on the B&#8217;s. Do the same with the B&#8217;s before you start the C&#8217;s 
and the same with the D&#8217;s.</p><p>
Your daily must do list should be comprised of the working parts of completing 
your weekly must do list. The same goes for the weekly, being made up of the 
action steps for the monthly and in turn for your yearly things to accomplish. 
When you begin to plan you day, time becomes your friend. You must plan your 
work and work your plan, because if you fail to plan, you are planning to fail. 
UPS drivers have 340 time saving movements when delivering packages from which 
hand buckles the seat belt to accelerating on the gas, how is that for micro 
management?</p><p>
Sometimes working on the biggest rocks first is not as fun to knocking out some 
of the other gravel type tasks. If you are in an office and had to call back 
that one customer that you have been putting off for days, would you rather call 
him first thing in the morning or keep putting it off hour by hour until it is 
time to go home and you never make the call because the same thing happen day 
after day. If you called him first thing in the morning, the rest of the day is 
yours to enjoy without having to worry about making that call.</p><p>
The same goes for a relationship would you rather marry someone and not really 
love them and stay married and have a miserable life, or would you rather 
address the issue immediately and enjoy the rest of your life. Now that&#8217;s time 
management. People fear scheduling many things that they know must get done, but 
are comfortable knowing that they can do it later. Sometimes it doesn&#8217;t mater if 
you go over the fence or just jump back down, you just can&#8217;t stay on the fence 
for the rest of you life. When you decide to get off that fence, there are many 
more options out there for you. There is also the old saying of &#8220;Poop or get off 
the pot.&#8221; I find it appropriate to mention this only because too many people are 
comfortable not scheduling things because if they stay in their comfort zone, 
they cannot fail. In reality the longer they push things off, they are 
constantly failing.</p><p>
Start with your next day and look at the activities that must get done. Starting 
with the A&#8217;s than the B&#8217;s through D&#8217;s set times to accomplish each task. Ask 
yourself, &#8220;How long should this task take?&#8221; Once you answer that question, get a 
day planner and write in that task in the appropriate time block. Make sure you 
have scheduled all you&#8217;re A&#8217;s before you work on the B&#8217;s through D&#8217;s. You may be 
asking what if I don&#8217;t get to all my C&#8217;s and D&#8217;s before the day is over. Every 
day, transfer them to your next day and eventually you will finish everything. 
There are many computer programs that do all this for you automatically. I 
personally use Microsoft Outlook and Act, there are many out there that work 
just as well. I suggest you find the way that works best for you, but you must 
implement immediately.</p><p>
Every night before you go to bed you should know what the next day will look 
like and when you will be doing what. These tasks should all be broken down into 
blocked time. Please don&#8217;t forget to schedule time for yourself to have some 
fun. A secret that I learned some time ago was to enjoy your work somehow by 
being creative with your activities. (Please check out my article, Balance In 
Life &#8211; No Longer A Balancing Act) The only time when we are bored doing 
something is when we lose interest in doing what is boring us, so find something 
exciting in all tasks and you will suddenly find energy. Maybe you can make a 
game out of what ever you are doing and challenge yourself. It is great to want 
to do a lot of things but never sacrifice quality for speed. If you put in a 
gallon&#8217;s worth of water in an eight ounce cup, you have wasted most of your 
water. Don&#8217;t be like a Chinese dinner, initially feeling full and satisfied, but 
hungry again and looking for substance soon thereafter. Make sure you are doing 
things that are aligned with your values, beliefs and rules. Make many mistakes, 
but only make each one once. When you master the three keys of Prioritizing, 
Delegating and scheduling, you will be a master in time management.</p><p>
No one is perfect, so anticipate problem in all of your tasks. Handle one thing 
at a time, because when your focus is not 100% on the task at hand, you are 
cheating yourself and not utilizing your energy to its fullest. Have you ever 
heard the phrase if you need something done, give it to a busy person? This is 
because busy people know the value of the three keys of masterful time 
management and know how to get things done. Bad habits aren&#8217;t done by bad 
people, just the unbusy. When you have a full schedule, you will not have time 
to waste and be unproductive. Time wasters will slowly realize that they have to 
schedule time with you to try and waste your time.</p><p>
When you are working&#8230;work. When you are playing&#8230;play. If you are thinking of 
work at play, or play at work, you will not get the most abundance out of what 
you are doing and not be using your time as effectively as you should be. Is it 
in your best interest to pick up the phone when you are in the middle of things? 
Do you run your business or does it run you? If I challenged you to turn off 
your cell phone and computer for a week, could you handle it? Don&#8217;t react to 
things, plan for them. Yes I am suggesting that you schedule time to return 
telephone calls and e-mails. Do you read junk mail? Do you wish you had all the 
time you wasted reading junk mail back? What could you do with that time now? 
Here is you chance to decide, and schedule because you can decide not to read 
junk mail anymore.</p><p>
I am also going to mention a few more things that may open your eyes to new 
possibilities of gaining a few extra hours a day for you. Do you watch sitcoms 
on television? Would you wait in line for over an hour to save five dollars? 
Have you ever arrived at an appointment only to find that the person you were 
meeting with had to reschedule? This is my pet peeve so I will give you some 
quick tips to prevent this from happening (for more on this topic see my 
article, Commitments If You Make &#8216;Em Keep &#8216;Em). Any time I set an appointment, I 
ask the person to call me the morning of to confirm and I ask if they can&#8217;t see 
me to call and reschedule. This is done when setting the appointment, so the 
responsibility falls into their lap if they can not see me. This will prevent 
95% of your no-show&#8217;s, the other 5%usually have their heads in the clouds so 
high, you may ask if it is really worth you time to meet with them.</p><p>
You have learned many things in this article about time management that should 
make you more productive and earn you a few more hours in your day to enjoy. In 
closing I would like to share with you some statistics I found rather 
surprising. Is there an area in the following list where you could free up some 
time for yourself? You should be able to make cuts of up to at least 50% in this 
list of wasted time. The amount of time the average American in life spends&#8230;</p><p>
