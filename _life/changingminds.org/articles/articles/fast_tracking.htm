Fast-tracking Foreign Languages: How to Meet the Linguistic Challenges of 
Working Abroad</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Philip Yaffe</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Native English-speakers are increasingly exhorted to learn foreign languages 
to play a more effective role in globalisation. However, we tend not to learn 
foreign languages for three very valid reasons. </p>
<ol>
  <li>&nbsp;Many other peoples in the world are not just exhorted to learn 
  English, they are required to do so. Thus, you can find English virtually 
  everywhere you go. </li>
  <li>The grammar of most other languages, certainly most European languages, is 
  much more complex than English. Thus, native anglophones often view language 
  learning as a daunting, and even demoralising task. </li>
  <li>Most native anglophones, especially in North America, live in almost 
  exclusively English-speaking environments. We virtually never hear other 
  languages spoken live, on radio or television, and virtually never see them 
  written in newspapers, magazines, books, etc. This is hardly motivating. </li>
</ol>
<p>The fact is, the world conspires against anglophones learning other 
languages. So if you speak only English, you have no reason to be ashamed. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, whilst these factors explain why so few anglophones know other 
languages, they are not valid excuses for not learning them when the situation 
calls for it. For example, you are sent to open or manage a foreign subsidiary, 
you are assigned to negotiate or maintain working relationships with a foreign 
partner, etc. </p>
<p>How should you go about learning a foreign language with the least pain and 
most gain? In my personal experience, the secret lies in changing your mindset.
</p>
<p>I live in Brussels. I speak French fluently, understand and can more-or-less 
get around in Dutch and German, and I am now rapidly acquiring Spanish. But the 
first language I mastered was none of these. It was Swahili, which I learned 
when I spent two-and-a-half years working in Tanzania. </p>
<p>Like many (probably most) Americans growing up in an essentially 
English-speaking environment, I thought the ability to speak another language 
required superior intelligence; only people endowed with this unique talent 
could actually achieve it. Shortly after I got to Tanzania, I visited in a 
remote tribal area where virtually everyone spoke three languages. Moreover, 
virtually none of them had ever seen the inside of a school (there just weren't 
any schools), let alone graduated from a prestigious university (UCLA). </p>
<p>I therefore had to radically rethink my attitude towards language learning. 
This new mindset has significantly helped me master the languages I now 
regularly use. I will illustrate with French, the language I know best. But 
remember, these same ideas and techniques apply to virtually any language you 
may need to acquire. <br>
</p>
<h2>Some Useful Psychology </h2>
<p>The good news is: Learning to speak a language is the easiest part of the 
job. </p>
<p>I know you may have thought that speaking would be the most difficult part. 
However, I would argue that most people, with minimal effort, can learn to speak 
a foreign language reasonably well really quite quickly. </p>
<p>Writing a language is very a different story. French, for example, is one of 
the most complex written languages in the world. In fact, written French and 
spoken French are almost two separate languages. Therefore, if your objective is 
to speak, concentrate on the spoken language and leave the written language to 
come along later. </p>
<p>I know this may sound like heresy, because the majority of language courses 
try to teach both at the same time, particularly in public schools. They spend a 
demoralising amount of time making you write a language (probably because it is 
easier to grade students this way), although this is the last thing you really 
need to know. </p>
<p>When I say that speaking is the easiest part of the job, I am not advocating 
&quot;total immersion&quot;. Few of us have the luxury of spending a week, or preferably 
several weeks, totally concentrating on learning a language. What I am 
advocating is doing things in the proper psychological order. </p>
<p>Most people can master enough of the fundamentals to be able to speak (poorly 
but nevertheless coherently), and to understand what is being said to them, 
within only 2 - 3 months. The trick is to recognise that the major obstacle to 
acquiring a foreign language is not grammar. <u>It's vocabulary</u>. </p>
<p>If you don't know the verb you need, it doesn't matter that you know how to 
conjugate verbs; you still cannot speak. If you don't know the adjective you 
need, it doesn't matter that you know how to decline adjectives; you still 
cannot speak. And so on. </p>
<p>I therefore suggest that the most effective order for learning a language 
would be: <br>
</p>
<h3>1. Basic grammar </h3>
<p>The minimum necessary to put together an intelligible (if incorrect) 
sentence.<br>
</p>
<p>In my experience, this is most efficiently done self-taught. Sit down with a 
grammar book for about 10-15 minutes each day until you begin to feel somewhat 
comfortable with it. <br>
</p>
<h3>2. Basic vocabulary </h3>
<p>The minimum necessary to begin using the basic grammar.</p>
<p>Again, in my experience this is most efficiently done self-taught, i.e. the 
classic &quot;learn five new words each day&quot;. It won't be very long before you start 
seeing how different words are related, so you can begin to guess what new words 
mean without resorting to the dictionary. <br>
</p>
<h3>3. Speaking the language </h3>
<p>Putting basic grammar and vocabulary to work as soon as you can actually 
begin using them. <br>
</p>
<p>This is the time to consider a language school or a personal tutor. With the 
foundation of what you will have already learned by yourself, you will certainly 
progress more easily and rapidly than if you had leapt into formal language 
instruction at the very beginning.<br>
</p>
<h3>4. Writing the language </h3>
<p>Tackling the daunting task of putting the language on paper. <br>
</p>
<p>You will almost certainly never need to do much writing. And what you do 
write will certainly need to be revised and corrected by a native speaker.<br>
</p>
<p>Since vocabulary is crucial, then the largely unrecognised key to mastering 
another language is: Learn to read it. </p>
<p>There is nothing like being able to sit down with a newspaper, magazine, or 
even a novel in the language to reinforce both grammar and vocabulary. The more 
you read, the more your vocabulary will expand. And the more some of the 
language's apparently bizarre ways of doing things will become increasingly 
familiar. </p>
<p>best results, the novel should contain a maximum of dialogue and a minimum of 
description. With dialogue, you can frequently anticipate and interpret what the 
characters are saying; with description you haven't a clue. </p>
<p>When I was learning French, I used novels by Agatha Christie and the 
adventures of Tarzan by Edgar Rice Burroughs, because they are about 90% 
dialogue and 10% description. Hardly my favourite literature, but they served 
the purpose. I would also suggest Animal Farm by George Orwell and Candide by 
Voltaire. However, any novel with a high ratio of dialogue to description will 
do. </p>
<h3>Important Tip </h3>
<p>The purpose of reading in the language is to learn vocabulary <u>
automatically</u>. Constantly looking up unfamiliar words will break your 
reading rhythm and damage your enjoyment. <i>Consequently, keep use of a 
dictionary to an absolute minimum</i>. </p>
<p>It isn't heresy to say this, just common sense. </p>
<p>In fiction, very few words are crucial for understanding the story line. Do 
you really need to know precisely what a room looks like? It's enough to know 
that is large and elegantly furnished. Do you really need to know precisely what 
a landscape looks like? It is enough to know that it is isolated and windy. </p>
<p>Moreover, words repeat. You will certainly see an unfamiliar word many more 
times throughout the text. At least one of those times, the way it is used will 
tell you exactly what it means, with no effort at all. <br>
<br>
</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, if you are using a dictionary more than 2 - 3 times a 
page, you are probably being too fastidious. Stop it. Just read and enjoy! </p>
<p>Once you arrive on site where the language is spoken, all the grammar and 
vocabulary you have stored up in this way will rapidly show its worth. </p>
<p>In my case, this occurred only a very few weeks after landing in Tanzania. At 
the beginning, I was speaking by translating through English. However, one magic 
day I suddenly realised that I was no longer translating through English. I was 
speaking in Swahili directly. It was like being released from prison. Although 
this happened more than 40 years ago, the picture of my cell door flying open 
and my mind flying free is as vivid now as the day it happened. It's an 
experience not to be missed! </p>
<p>Having discovered that I could really speak a foreign language - <i>and that 
I didn't have to be a genius to do it </i>- I tried to determine how it had 
happened. I came to the conclusion that the single most important psychological 
factor is <u>resignation</u>. </p>
<p>Different languages have different ways of doing things, some of which will 
seem quite absurd. It is useless to keep moaning: &quot;Why do they speak in this 
ridiculous way when it is so much easier to do it the way we do it in English?&quot;
</p>
<p>Whatever it is you find so annoying: <u>Don't fight it; accept it</u>. </p>
<p>This is how children learn languages. They don't constantly question 
grammatical structures, because it would just never occur to them to do so. And 
we all know how much more easily and rapidly &quot;naïve&quot; children learn languages 
than do we &quot;sophisticated&quot; adults! <br>
</p>
<h2>Three Fundamental Principles </h2>
<p>With Swahili as a basis, I also tried to determine the fundamental principles 
of language learning that could help me go on to mastering others. I found three 
to be particularly useful. </p>
<h3>Facility Principle</h3>
<p>What you don't have to do is always <br>
easier than what you do have to do. <br>
</p>
<p>In other words, the less you have to think about in learning a language, the 
more rapidly you will learn it. And the fewer mistakes you will make. As I will 
demonstrate below, French has certain features and characteristics that make it 
dramatically easier than English. Take advantage of them. </p>
<p>Here is the second principle that can smooth your way. </p>
<h3>Familiarity Principle</h3>
<p class="quote">Familiar habits and patterns of thought are often hard to 
break.<br>
</p>
<p>Paradoxically, some of the aspects where another language is easier than 
English at first glance appear unfamiliar - and therefore falsely difficult. 
Although it may take you some time to accept them, once you begin to think in 
the language, you will rapidly come to appreciate them and enjoy their benefits.
</p>
<p>Here is an anecdote to illustrate the point. </p>
<p>One time I was talking with a Dutch-speaking friend. He agreed that English 
is fundamentally simpler than his own language; nevertheless, he complained that 
he just couldn't get used to English's simpler sentence structure. In certain 
instances, Dutch grammar requires the order of the words in the sentence to 
reverse; this never happens in English. Objectively, then, English sentence 
structure should be easier than Dutch. But to him, <i>not reversing the word 
order just didn't seem natural</i>. </p>
<p>Here is a third principle you will find extremely useful. </p>
<h3>Context Principle</h3>
<p class="quote">By themselves, words and sentences have little meaning; often 
they can be understood only in relation to other words and sentences.<br>
</p>
<p>This is very reassuring. It means that even if you say something incorrectly, 
in general people will still understand you because of the context in which you 
say it. Likewise, even if people say something to you using unfamiliar grammar 
or vocabulary, in general you will still be able to understand them because of 
the context in which they say it. </p>
<p><i>In short, you don't have to approach perfection in a language in order to 
use it effectively.</i> </p>
<h2>Focus on Simplicities, not Complexities </h2>
<p>To conclude, let me fulfil the promise I made to demonstrate that French has 
certain features and characteristics that make it dramatically easier than 
English. This is equally true of most other languages, regardless of how 
difficult they may seem at first. The important thing is to focus on the 
simplicities, not the complexities. <br>
Here are just seven examples; I could cite many more. <br>
</p>
<h3>1. No tonic accent <br>
</h3>
<p>Most people are largely unaware of how seriously difficult their own native 
language could be to a foreigner. As a native speaker, you probably find that 
English is quite easy to pronounce. But the fact is, French is even easier. <br>
</p>
<p>What! With its nasalisation, trilled &quot;r&quot; and other difficult sounds? 
Absolutely! <br>
</p>
<p>First, it is important to understand that <u>no sounds, in any language, are 
inherently difficult to pronounce</u>. If they were, they wouldn't exist because 
the native speakers would never have accepted them in the first place. <br>
</p>
<p>Learning to pronounce unfamiliar foreign sounds is never easy. Francophones 
learning English have a terrible time pronouncing the &quot;th&quot; sound in words such 
as &quot;the&quot;, &quot;they&quot;, &quot;through&quot;, &quot;throw&quot;, etc., because there is no French 
equivalent. But they do it reasonably well. Just as you may have difficulty with 
certain French sounds that have no English equivalents. But you can also do it.
<br>
</p>
<p>Where French pronunciation has an undeniable advantage over English is its 
virtual lack of a &quot;tonic accent&quot;.<br>
</p>
<p>Tonic accent simply means that certain syllables are given more stress than 
are others. For example, &quot;difficult&quot; is pronounced &quot;<u>dif</u>-fi-cult&quot;; the 
first syllable carries the tonic accent. It could just as easily be pronounced 
dif-<u>fi</u>-cult, or even &quot;dif-fi-<u>cult</u>&quot;.<br>
</p>
<p>Technically, the tonic accent does exist in French, but it is very hard to 
hear it. For example, in English we say &quot;<u>rest</u>-au-rant; there is a 
distinct stress on the first syllable. In French, this is &quot;rest-au-rant&quot;, with 
no stress anywhere. Likewise, &quot;con--<u>ven</u>-tion&quot; has a distinct stress on 
the second syllable. In French, this is simply &quot;con-ven-tion&quot;, with no stress. 
And so on for every word in the language. </p>
<p>Thus, you never have to guess where the tonic accent should go, <u>so you can 
never make a mistake</u>. <br>
</p>
<p>You have grown up with the tonic accent, so you might not immediately 
recognise what a problem it really is, even between native speakers. Britons, 
for example, like to say &quot;con-<u>tro</u>-ver-sy&quot; whilst Americans prefer to say 
&quot;<u>con</u>-tro-ver-sy&quot;. And sometimes they don't understand each other because 
of this difference. Britons say &quot;<u>gar</u>-age&quot; whilst Americans say gar-<u>age</u>&quot;, 
again with the possibility of misunderstanding. And so on. In French, there is 
no tonic accent, so this problem simply doesn't exist. <br>
</p>
<h3>2. Gallic Impersonality <br>
</h3>
<h4><i>A. Use of &quot;on&quot;</i></h4>
<p>or anglophones, imbued with the idea that French is a very personal language 
(the so-called &quot;'language of love&quot;), few things are more surprising than the 
frequent use of the very impersonal &quot;on&quot; (pronounced <i>ohn</i>). By contrast, 
francophones learning English are surprised to discover that English has no 
equivalent of &quot;on&quot;, so they have to search all over the place for substitutes.
<br>
</p>
<p>Actually, this is not entirely true. English does have an equivalent, &quot;one&quot;, 
but it is seldom used. The Queen of England uses it: &quot;One has considered the 
matter carefully&quot; rather than &quot;I have considered the matter carefully&quot;. 
Moralists use it: &quot;One should not kill&quot;, &quot;One should be ready to fight for one's 
country&quot;, etc. <br>
</p>
<p>French uses &quot;on&quot; without the slightest embarrassment. In fact, using it 
prevents a lot of embarrassment. For example, a key problem in English is 
avoiding &quot;genderism&quot;. This is the explanation for the very odd use of the plural 
pronoun &quot;they&quot; as if it were a singular. Example: If someone studies hard, <u>
they</u> will succeed.</p>
<p>Why do we make this apparently illogical switch from the singular pronoun 
&quot;someone&quot; and the singular verb &quot;studies&quot; to the plural pronoun &quot;they'? Because 
otherwise, it would have been necessary to say &quot;he will succeed&quot;. However, the 
sentence clearly is not directed only to males. Alternatively, it would have 
been necessary to say &quot;he or she will succeed&quot;, or &quot;he/she will succeed&quot;, which 
are cumbersome. French has no such problem, because &quot;on&quot; (one) is the universal 
solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<h4><i>B. Use of possessive adjectives </i><br>
</h4>
<p>Here is another example of how Gallic impersonality avoids genderism. 
Consider the sentence: &quot;Everyone who studies hard will see <u>their</u> effort 
rapidly rewarded.&quot; We start the sentence with a singular subject and verb; 
however, we finish it with a plural possessive adjective (&quot;their&quot;). In French, 
the sentence remains singular all the way through, because there is no gender 
distinction. &quot;Son effort&quot; can mean either &quot;his effort&quot; or &quot;her effort&quot;, 
according to the context. <br>
</p>
<p>Thus, the inherently impersonal nature of French grammar automatically 
precludes a lot of &quot;political incorrectness&quot;. In English, we can achieve this 
only through some rather illogical and inelegant grammatical contortions. <br>
<br>
</p>
<h4><i>3. Use of infinitives</i></h4>
<p>A major problem French speakers (and most other Europeans) face in English is 
the correct use of infinitives. As a native speaker, you probably never realised 
that infinitives can be a problem. After all, an infinitive is just an 
infinitive. <br>
</p>
<p>Well, not quite. English infinitives are in fact very unusual compared to 
French infinitives. This is because French infinitives are unified, whilst 
English infinitives are separable. For example: <br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. French: mang<u>er</u> (-er marks the infinitive)<br>
2. English: to eat <br>
<br>
</p>
<p>The French infinitive is always a single word; however, the English 
infinitive can be used with both parts or only the second part. The problem is, 
in many cases this is not optional, but required. For example: &quot;I need to eat 
something&quot; (both parts), but &quot;I must eat something&quot; (only second part). So 
what's the difference? Why in the first example is the &quot;to&quot; necessary and in the 
second not only isn't it necessary, using it would be quite incorrect? <br>
</p>
<p>In French, this problem never arises. &quot;J'ai besoin de <u>manger</u> quelque 
chose&quot; (I need to eat something) and &quot;Je dois <u>manger</u> quelque chose&quot; (I 
must eat something). Simple, isn't it. Just imagine if French worked like 
English. You would constantly be making choices about which form of the 
infinitive to use - and in many cases you would be wrong. <br>
<br>
</p>
<h4><i>4. Use of definite articles</i></h4>
<p>Use of the definite article (&quot;the&quot;) in English presents pretty much the same 
problem as use of the infinitive. In other words, you must always be making 
choices about when to use it and when not to use it. French is much simpler.<br>
</p>
<p>Really! Doesn't French have three definitive articles (le, la, les) compared 
to only one in English? Absolutely! But the problem is not deciding which 
definite article to use. Rather, it is deciding whether or not to use any 
definitive article at all. <br>
</p>
<p>In French, you retain the definite article much more frequently than you do 
in English. Thus, you have considerably fewer decisions to make, and therefore 
considerably fewer opportunities to make a mistake. <br>
</p>
<p><i>Example </i><br>
1. &quot;I like cats&quot; (cats in general)<br>
2. &quot;I like the cats&quot; (specific cats, not necessarily all cats) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In French, both statements are rendered &quot;J'aime <u>les</u> chats&quot;, so no 
decision about whether or not to use the definite article. You distinguish the 
meanings of the two sentences from the context in which they are used, not their 
grammatical form.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h4><i>5. No distinction between &quot;a&quot; and &quot;one&quot; </i></h4>
<p>The words &quot;a&quot; and &quot;one&quot; are the equivalent of &quot;un&quot; in French. Fundamentally, 
these two words mean the same thing; however, &quot;one&quot; is more precise, so it adds 
emphasis. <i>For example</i>: <br>
1. I saw a Chinese film (<i>at least one, perhaps more</i>)<br>
2. I saw one Chinese film (<i>only one, no more</i>) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both of these sentences are rendered in French as &quot;J'ai vu <u>un</u> film 
chinois.&quot; As with the definite article, you distinguish the meaning from the 
context.<br>
</p>
<p>Many francophones speaking English frequently make the mistake of saying &quot;I 
have eaten in one Japanese restaurant&quot; when they really mean &quot;I have eaten in a 
Japanese restaurant&quot;. As an anglophone speaking French, you will never make this 
mistake, because it <i>simply isn't possible</i>! <br>

<h4><i>6. Simple &amp; progressive (continuous) tenses </i></h4>
<p>English makes frequent use of progressive (continuous) verb tenses, whilst 
French almost never does.</p>
<p>The progressive tenses are formed by two verbs: the helper (auxiliary) &quot;to 
be&quot; and the &quot;present participle&quot; (-<u>ing</u> form) of the other one. </p>
<p><i>Example</i>: She is eating. <br>
<br>
</p>
<p>English uses progressive tenses to distinguish between the general time 
period during which an action takes place and the exact moment that the action 
takes place. French generally does not make this distinction. &quot;Elle mange&quot; means 
either &quot;she eats&quot; or &quot;she is eating&quot;. Once again, French leaves interpretation 
of the correct meaning to context. <br>
</p>
<p>And once again, since there is only one grammatical form, there is no 
possibility of error! <br>
<br>
</p>
<h4><i>7. Converting verbs into nouns </i><br>
</h4>
<p>Because of its fondness for progressive verb tenses, English has a 
characteristic way of converting verbs into nouns, i.e. using a verb as the 
subject or the object of a sentence. <br>
</p>
<p>In French, and many other languages, you simply use the infinitive: <u>
Marcher</u> est bon pour les poumons. You can do the same thing in English: <u>
To walk</u> is good for the lungs. However, the preferred form is: <u>Walking</u> 
is good for the lungs. To anglophone ears, &quot;walking&quot; is more dynamic than &quot;to 
walk&quot;, i.e. it seems to give a better picture of what is happening.<br>
</p>
<p>This may very well be the case - <i>in English</i>. But there is no such 
distinction in French. So once again, <i>there is no way of making a mistake</i>!
</p>
<p>Admittedly, learning another language is never easy; it takes time, energy 
and dedication. However, as we have seen, there are three powerful strategies 
you can use to make the job considerably easier. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Focus on the simplicities of the other language rather than on its 
  complexities.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Channel your energies according to the best psychological order:
  <ul>
    <li>Basic grammar </li>
    <li>Basic vocabulary </li>
    <li>Speaking the language</li>
    <li>Writing the language </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Concentrate on reading the language to comfortably and automatically 
  master its grammar and vocabulary </li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck! Bonne chance! Veel geluk! Viel Gelück! Buena suerte! Buona fortuna!
