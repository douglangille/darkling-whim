<h1>The Power &amp; Paradox of Disruptive Leadership</h1>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="../articles.htm">Guest articles</a> &gt; The Power &amp; Paradox of Disruptive Leadership</p>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Ted Santos</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What separates extraordinary leaders from managers?&nbsp; One way to distinguish 
the difference is to compare the mindset of leaders and managers.&nbsp; Managers are 
great at solving problems.&nbsp; Leaders, on the other hand, exude their greatness by 
creating problems. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Dilemma of Creating Problems</h2>
<p>People who are great problem solvers are often presented with the opportunity 
to become a manager.&nbsp; However, the keys to the executive suite require that you 
develop new skills and competencies.&nbsp; You must become comfortable creating 
problems for your people to solve. </p>
<p>Why would a leader create problems?&nbsp; Intentional problems can be the catalyst 
for a company to make changes.&nbsp; Problems can evoke the necessary motivation to 
make a quantum leap in revenue, innovation or significant cost savings.</p>
<p>Yet, creating problems intentionally is counterintuitive.&nbsp; We are taught to 
fix problems, get rid of them or find out who caused the problem and then get 
rid of them.&nbsp; Culturally, we reward people for being problem solvers.&nbsp; 
Nevertheless, when you look at extraordinary accomplishments of great leaders, 
one finds quantum leaps were always preceded by a problem. </p>
<p>However, there is a catch to continuously making quantum leaps.&nbsp; It requires 
constant learning and development as well as change.&nbsp; Can leaders continuously 
develop themselves to create problems or more importantly, master change?&nbsp; </p>
<p>This article will focus on leaders who created problems and created history 
in the process.&nbsp; It will also explore what could happen when leadership stops 
creating problems.&nbsp; In subsequent articles, we will reveal the strategies 
extraordinary leaders implement to drive change in their organizations as well 
as the kind of environment that must exist in a corporation to fulfil on the 
leaders vision of the future. </p>
<p>Before an environment can be created, leadership has to be comfortable 
managing chaos.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; While change and innovation are chaotic, they are also 
the competitive edge.&nbsp; If an organization is committed to greatness, the leaders 
are called upon to drive and manage change.&nbsp; However, if leadership is not 
comfortable with chaos, they are faced with a paradox: drive change and disrupt 
the organization, or avoid it, at the risk of stagnating.</p>
<p>While change can be chaotic, stagnation can be fatal to the company&#8217;s 
future.&nbsp; Disruption, on the other hand, can be managed by acquiring leadership 
tools.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When leaders of the past were the catalyst for historical events, did they 
possess tools? &nbsp;Do today&#8217;s leaders have access to those tools.</p>
<p>There have always been leaders who orchestrated change throughout history.&nbsp; 
When you look at Sony, Ford or even go as far back as the Founding Fathers of 
the United States, they all demonstrated a set of skills and competencies for 
driving change and innovation. Were they just lucky or did they possess special 
tools?</p>
<h2>Necessity is the Mother of Invention</h2>
<p>In 1908 Henry Ford created a problem. He stated that he would make it 
possible for most households in the US to purchase a car.&nbsp; This was at a time 
when only 2% of the US population earned enough income to buy an automobile.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In the late 1800s, the cost of an automobile was $1,500.&nbsp; The average annual 
income in the US was $750.&nbsp; This gave Henry Ford the insurmountable problem of 
capturing 98% of the market.&nbsp; In 1908, he launched the Model T for $850.&nbsp; By 
1924, when most households owned an automobile, the cost of the Model T was $290<a name="_ftnref1" title style="color: blue; text-underline: single" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>By building the assembly line, the problem he created was solved.&nbsp; He was 
able to significantly reduce the cost of making a vehicle.&nbsp; As a result, the 
Ford Motor Company successfully increased market share from 9% in 1908 to 61% in 
1921<a name="_ftnref2" title style="color: blue; text-underline: single" href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>. 
&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1979, Sony brilliantly created the personal audio market with the 
Walkman.&nbsp; The problem they created was simple: develop a device that allows 
individuals to privately listen to music anywhere, anytime.</p>
<p>These are excellent examples of enterprises stepping out of the box and 
creating problems.&nbsp; Was it enough?&nbsp; Creating problems requires that leaders have 
the competency called mindset or intrapersonal skills &#8211; a clear understanding of 
relationship with self, opportunity, the future, change and others &#8211; before they 
can effectively managing chaos.&nbsp; Strong intrapersonal skills can empower an 
individual in the face of risk or uncertainty.&nbsp; It also contributes to one&#8217;s 
ability to continue to learn beyond the proverbial comfort zone. </p>
<h2>The problem of not creating problems</h2>
<p>Sometimes success can be a corporation&#8217;s biggest enemy.&nbsp; In the case of Henry 
Ford, he did not continually develop himself as a problem creator. Instead of 
managing problems he intentionally created, he focused on solving a problem that 
had, for the most part, been solved.&nbsp; What he experienced next was a big 
problem. </p>
<p>For example, once most households owned a car, he stayed focused on making 
the automobile still more affordable.&nbsp; As a result, the window of opportunity 
was left open for General Motors.&nbsp; GM created the next problem in the auto 
industry: people could now drive a car in any colour they chose and could select 
from a variety of new models.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In 1924, GM launched their innovative line of automobiles.&nbsp; As a result, Ford 
lost tremendous market share.&nbsp; Ford&#8217;s market share dropped from 50% in 1926 to 
20% in 1950<a name="_ftnref3" title style="color: blue; text-underline: single" href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>.&nbsp; 
Conversely, GM&#8217;s market share increased from 20% in 1926 to 50% in 1950. </p>
<p>In the case of Sony, they were the innovator of the Walkman.&nbsp; However, Apple 
dominates the digital personal audio market with 78 percent market share in the 
U.S today.&nbsp; Could Sony have created the iPod?&nbsp;&nbsp; Or did the possibility of 
changing their infrastructure to support a new innovative product look like a 
problem? </p>
<p>In the midst of chaos, there is always the difficulty of distinguishing 
opportunity from disruption.&nbsp; In most cases, it depends on your 
mindset/perspective.&nbsp; It is not that chaos itself is inherently a problem.&nbsp; It 
is the mindset of the individual that will determine how clearly they can see 
what is in front of them and the actions that ensue.&nbsp; It is analogous to a 
captain of a boat steering a ship though a violent storm.&nbsp; The captain must 
always keep his eye on what he is committed to accomplishing &#8211; return to shore.&nbsp; 
Once his or her mind drifts and focuses on what&#8217;s wrong, his or her ship is 
sunk.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
