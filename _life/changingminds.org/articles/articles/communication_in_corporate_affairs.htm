<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="../articles.htm">Guest articles</a> &gt; Communication in Corporate Affairs</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Margaret Francis</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Globalization of economy is the basic trend of 21st century. Most of the 
academic discussions concentrating on corporate communication which is important 
in the application of marketing techniques in the industry. The relevance of 
successful and coordinated corporate communication is unquestionable. 
Theoretically supported corporate communications are effective in the successful 
business and its effects identified by the leading companies. It is equally 
important as technology since application of technology need to communicate 
effectively in the corporate world. With out effective communication corporate 
relationship will be impossible. Proper communication will enable the business 
growth in an organization. </p>
<p>Now a days Information Technology and management are the recent trend in the 
career field. Most of the company is looking for the people who are able to make 
some changes. Communication skill is an essential element in this new generation 
job. Also employees should be able to take new challenges and to perform the job 
responsibility effectively. In this competitive world, employees should be able 
to understand the situation and to communicate the meaningful information in 
time. </p>
<p>The purpose of communication management is the accessibility of information 
flow from top management to bottom. It will be effective only when officials are 
communicating information effectively to all the employees. Thus all parties 
should be communicate and transfer the necessary information meaningfully and 
resourcefully. The development of the organization depends on its communication 
process. Since each and every business process communication is inevitable. It 
is an exchange of information and knowledge with the internal groups as well as 
stakeholders who have direct relationship with the organization, which will 
enhance the growth of the organization.</p><p>
Corporate communication is the strong and consistent message which is 
influencing and motivating its employees and stakeholders and also it aims to 
attain business development success. If there is any change or business crisis, 
corporate communication plays a very vital role to handle it effectively. Every 
body is looking forward how will the change or crisis affect the organization 
and how it handled by the authorities. They also have the curiosity to know how 
a company tackles the situations even after the event is over. In corporate life 
it is very indispensable; you need to put into words what ever you did. Moreover 
you need to communicate confidently.</p><p>
Communication is the cornerstone function of every organization to buildup its 
status in the corporate world as well as its stakeholders. Their work is very 
concerned with internal communications management from the standpoint of sharing 
knowledge and decisions from the enterprise with employees, suppliers, investors 
and partners. Communications is one of the most important link between an 
organization and the public.</p><p>
Major companies are considered communication as an effective tool to 
intensifying its scope and rationalizing its service. They have renewed their 
communication strategy to expand their branches in various parts of the country. 
Organization interaction with the community, its stakeholders, staff and other 
interested groups always channel its progress. Leading organizations have 
their own communication team with efficient communicators who are responsible 
for communication function with various national and international 
organizations. </p><p>
Each communication department has its own Communicators and communications 
director is the head of the board. They have communication teams and department 
has its own right. Certain other organizations communications happen in the 
areas of public involvement, clients and the corporate affairs department. 
Communication can be a part of someone&#8217;s job. Time demands are not concerned in 
the case of important communications. Communications professional&#8217;s role is 
different based on their seniority and designation. It may also depend on 
whether they are working individually or group based. Usually their role is to 
make information about their organization which is to be accessed by their staff 
and public. It also aims to the accountability and their involvement in the 
reforms that are taking place.</p><p>
Early management theories assumed bosses should be dominant, paternal, and
rational in the use of communication to direct employees' work. The body of
knowledge relevant to that managerial philosophy can be reduced to one 
directive:
Give instructions clearly and firmly. From that limited beginning, research and
theory progressed to explain the impact organizations have on how people communicate and why communication helps or harms organizations (Morgan, 1986;
Redding, 1985; Richetto, 1977).</p><p>
Many research studies revealed that human relationship empowering employee&#8217;s 
interest in their work and a positive attitude about themselves and about the 
organization. This leads to the use of advanced management philosophy. </p>
<p>Employee&#8217;s involvement in the design and execution of work recognized by the 
managers and researchers and they emphasized bosses cannot control workers as 
per human resource approach. There is a cooperative balance between bosses and 
employees in the Revolutionizing management theory, where the human resources 
shifted the locus of control. A recent version of this approach reduces organizational excellence and productivity to the axiom &quot;Work smarter, not harder.&quot; 
That
approach to management treats employees and organizational processes as being
thoughtful ( Jablin, 1982a; Morgan, Frost, &amp; Pondy, 1983)</p><p>
Corporate Communications is the processes a company uses to communicate all its 
messages to key constituencies. It encodes and promotes a strong corporate 
culture, a coherent corporate identity, an appropriate and professional 
relationship with the media, and quick, responsible ways of communicating in a 
crisis. It also defines how an organization communicates with its stakeholders 
and how that brings a company's values to life. Corporate Communications are 
often defined as the products of communications, memos, letters, reports, Web 
sites, community engagement, social and environmental initiatives or programs. 
These make up most importantly an aggregate of messages that a company sends to 
its constituencies whether internal or external. </p><p>
It is important to build up an image of a company by demonstrating its integrity 
and to listen and speak to its stakeholders honestly. This makes corporate 
social responsibility as a vital component of Corporate Communications, making 
it as a strategic tool in which a company stand out by creating competitive 
advantage </p><p>
Interpersonal communication in an organization, realize the fact that the 
interpersonal communication transpires when people inside a company interact 
with out side people like products sale and services to customers or
clients. All means of communication occurs in large companies, employees 
routinely communicate interpersonally with one another, for instance by phone or 
writing, without ever meeting face to face. A variety of new electronic 
innovations offer many possibilities for interpersonal contact through mediated 
channels. &quot;Interpersonal communication,&quot; Weick ( 1987) observed, &quot;is the essence 
of
organization because it creates structures that then affect what else gets said 
and
done and by whom&quot; Organizational performances are interactional, contextual, episodic, and improvisational (Pacanowsky &amp; O'Donnell-Trujillo, 1982).</p><p>
Interpersonal communication is important for the exchange of information and
coordination of activities. Employees' perception of the quality of 
communication
in their organization depends on their interaction with their supervisors, the 
climate
in the company, and appraisal others make of their work performance ( Pincus,
1986).</p><p>
Employees are approaching their immediate head to get job related information 
which will affect their performance, satisfaction, team work and turn over. They 
are also seeking information from the top management to extent the scope of 
their efforts in the outcome especially productivity, commitment, morale, 
loyalty and trust. The crisis issues of the company like risk management, 
environment, social investment and community engagement are forcing companies to 
become more deliberately engaged through communicators. </p>
<p>Communication is the key factor in the creation, implementation, monitoring 
and reporting on all corporate activities. Through communication, stakeholders 
understand company&#8217;s purpose, goals and values. Communication also aimed to 
influence employee&#8217;s attitude toward the workplace loyalty and pride in the 
company in which they are working. Theoretically speaking, Corporate 
Communication plays a critical role in building and maintaining relationships 
with the stakeholders of a corporation. Communication is an unavoidable tool in 
the corporate sector. Media communications are an essential channel through 
which all stakeholders receive information and develop perceptions of a company.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p>
<p>Specific responsibilities of a corporate communicator include:</p>
<ul>

  <li>Producing high quality information service </li>

<p>
Now a days communication professional are facing lot of challenges in the areas 
of global corporate and brand positioning, internal relations in change 
situations, corporate identity shaping, and brand management. All communication 
is based on organizational strategy and the communication professionals are 
expected to fulfill the objectives of the organization.</p><p>
Corporate Communication experts are the advocates for an organisations in 
managing the complex communications that take places between organisations and 
their external and internal audiences. These specialist communicators are 
representing the organisation and make the organisation to aware of public views 
and attitudes. Other responsibilities of corporate communicators include media

successful accomplishment of organisational objectives. </p><p>
In conclusion, corporate communications represents the corporation's voice, its 
reputation, integrity and the images it projects of itself on a global and 
regional stage populated by its various audiences and stakeholders. </p>
