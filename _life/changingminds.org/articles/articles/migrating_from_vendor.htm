Migrating from Vendor to Partner</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Lee B. Salz</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no bigger insult to a sales person than being called a &#8220;vendor.&#8221; Are 
you the reason why prospects see you that way? In this article, you will learn 
how to be seen as a partner.</p>
<p>So, it&#8217;s been another round of price squeezing. Very painful! They want it 
cheaper and your company has tasked you with protecting margin. To make matters 
worse, the prospect called you one of the worst things possible&#8230; a vendor! At 
this point, you have probably decided that sales really isn&#8217;t fun. There is 
hope! You can change the entire playing field by changing your style, your 
approach, and your game. 
</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at two restaurants&#8230; McDonald&#8217;s and Morton&#8217;s. When you go to 
McDonald&#8217;s, you are there because you are hungry. When you go to Morton&#8217;s, you 
want a dining experience. McDonald&#8217;s offers value meals. Morton&#8217;s offers a high 
cost a la carte dining experience. If you are concerned about price, Morton&#8217;s is 
not for you. The McDonald&#8217;s experience involves you ordering a meal and the 
order is provided quickly and accurately for you. The question asked of every 
order at McDonald&#8217;s is, &#8220;would you like fries with that?&#8221; (Apparently, fries go 
with everything.) At Morton&#8217;s, the wait staff make initial recommendations, 
listen to the diner, make additional recommendations based on the dialogue, 
finish receiving the order, and the end result is a stellar meal. While both are 
successful restaurants, this is a metaphor for the vendor/partner relationship.
</p>
<p>With that in mind, consider these definitions courtesy of Websters.com&#8230; </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Vendor</i>: someone who promotes or exchanges goods or services for money.</li>
  <li><i>Partner</i>: one who participates in a relationship in which each member has equal 
status. </li>
</ul>
<p>Now consider these&#8230; </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Customer</i>: one that buys goods or services</li>
  <li><i>Client</i>: one that depends on the protection of another </li>
</ul>
<p>So if you put this together, customers have vendors, but clients have 
partners. Let&#8217;s make a deal, we won&#8217;t call them customers anymore and they won&#8217;t 
call us vendors because at the end of the day, people really want to be treated 
as clients. Vendors don&#8217;t have clients. I suspect that this isn&#8217;t overly 
revolutionary for you, but let&#8217;s contrast the vendor/partner relationship.<br>
</p>
<p>Vendors provide data, but partners interpret the data, analyze it, and make 
recommendations. For example, if you were having a business review meeting and 
told them how many widgets and gadgets they bought, you behaved as a vendor. If 
you asked them why the location in Missouri bought 30% more than the past, you 
behaved as a partner. </p>
<p>Vendors take orders, partners inquire as to why they want what they want. Out 
of the blue, you are asked to provide a different service than you have 
previously provided to your client. The vendor gets it done, and probably pretty 
quickly too. The partner asks questions to understand why this is desired and 
determines the optimum way to solve the business challenge at hand. </p>
<p>Vendors are reactive, or even responsive, but partners are proactive. Many 
sales people confuse handling issues quickly as being a partner. However, a true 
partner looks at the business and makes recommendations before challenges are 
experienced by the client. </p>
<p>Vendors take a narrow look at the world, but partners see the world in 
totality. If you were selling windows and your discussions exclusively focused 
on the windows and their benefits and functionality, you function as a vendor. 
If you discuss the entire house in conjunction with &#8220;the how&#8221; the windows 
purchase is related, you behave as a partner. </p>
<p>Vendors ask for the business, but partners share their perspective of the 
synergies that have been identified and ask how to put a marriage together. One 
of my favorite vendor questions is, &#8220;what will it take to get your business 
today?&#8221; There was a lesson I learned at a very young age when using a similar 
approach. I was selling to someone and we offered a point of sale incentive for 
buying on the initial visit. After presenting this, the man stood up and said if 
the deal isn&#8217;t good tomorrow, it isn&#8217;t good today. It was over seventeen years 
ago, but I remember it as if it were yesterday. No one wants to be sold. Trite 
sales expressions create the vendor aura. </p>
<p>Vendors make sales, but partners formulate mutually beneficial relationships. 
This is all about matchmaking which will be explored further. </p>
<p>In the movie &#8220;Wedding Crashers,&#8221; true love is defined as the soul&#8217;s 
recognition of its counterpoint in another. Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if client 
relationships worked the same way? Well, they can and they do. When true 
business partnerships are formulated, both parties grow as a result. In essence, 
one plus one equals four. But how do you find a match? </p>
<p>As a sales person, it is all about the mindset. If you wake up each morning 
with the goal of selling something to someone, the likelihood that you will 
formulate a partnership is probably equal to, or less than zero. Your mindset is 
about peddling your wares, not understanding and solving business problems. 
Business partnerships come together by identifying the synergies between 
organizations resulting in strong benefit for both. </p>
<p>The mindset of a matchmaker is very different than that of the traditional 
salesperson. Matchmakers wake up each morning with the goal of finding common 
bonds with business associates. Think of Velcro. The tighter the bond between 
the two surfaces, the more difficult it is to separate them. Thus, the ideal 
business partnership is created. </p>
<p>But what does it take to do this well? First, you have to master your half of 
the equation. You need to know every bit of what your company does and who the 
right audience is for it. You need to understand industry challenges and issues 
impacting your users. The best sales people are often viewed as industry experts 
because they understand the pertinent issues impacting their clientele. They 
have invested time to study and learn what is important to their clientele and 
mastered those elements. Most sales people never do this. They continue to 
repeat the same boring sales mantra over and over again. &#8220;Can I have your 
business, please?&#8221; </p>
<p>The second component is the ability to ask key questions of the potential 
business partner and synthesize the information. Launching questions into the 
air and failing to process the information is a common mistake. When preparing 
for the meeting, you should know what questions you will ask and the possible 
responses that you might hear. You can then prepare the appropriate direction 
for the conversation based on those responses. Another common mistake is asking 
questions that have little or nothing to do with matchmaking. There are just so 
many questions that someone will tolerate in one session, and in totality. 
Therefore, you need to ask the most relevant ones. Again, proper preparation on 
your part will help you to avoid this pitfall. </p>
<p>As a salesperson, there are a number of things you can do to establish 
partnerships instead of vendor relationships. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Learn and understand your company&#8217;s capabilities so you can clearly 
  articulate them.</li>
  <li>Study the industry you are in. Become well-versed on the issues impacting 
  users of your product or service.</li>
  <li>Ask global questions to understand the overall perspective and direction 
  of the company, not just relative to your solution.</li>
  <li>Analyze your client&#8217;s data. Ask questions of them and make recommendations 
  based on responses. </li>
  <li>Focus on match-making, not selling.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
