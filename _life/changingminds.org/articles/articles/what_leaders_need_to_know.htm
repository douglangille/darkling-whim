What Leaders need to know about failure: when Jack Welch blew up the plant</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Phil Dourado</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Failure is not the opposite of success, says Phil Dourado, leadership author 
and founder of www.TheLeadershipHub.com . Organizations, particularly their 
formal leaders, need to re-think failure, he argues in this short article. </p>
<p class="quote">ARNIE ON FAILURE:&nbsp; &#8216;If you fail, try, try again. Then bring in the stunt 
double.&#8217; - Arnold Schwarzenegger, quoted in Vanity Fair </p>
<p>You probably don&#8217;t think of yourself as a failure. But, you or so-called 
&#8216;leaders&#8217; in your organization may find it a useful label to hang on others. 
Allocating blame when things go wrong is a longstanding convention for 
maintaining the myth of leader infallibility. It poisons your culture, as those 
below will follow the lead. Using the authority of position to cascade blame 
becomes the norm. </p>
<p>The best leaders adopt a different perspective on failure, encouraging a 
<i>forgive and remember</i> culture. Firstly, you separate failure from the person &#8211; 
it&#8217;s an occurrence, not an inherent trait*. Secondly, you make it clear some 
failures are a desirable outcome of trying new things. Thirdly, you set in place 
practices for limiting damage when failure occurs and for capturing &amp; sharing 
learning. (*The caveat is, of course, that even with the best recruitment 
methods you can end up with someone who repeats mistakes or just makes too many 
and has to be moved or leave.) </p>
<p>This last &#8211; sharing learning to prevent repetition of mistakes - is where 
most organizations still fail. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Jack Welch, the legendary CEO of General Electric, illustrating the 
importance of leaders tolerating failure, with an episode from his own past: </p>
<p><b>Kirsty Wark</b>: I understand one of the first things you did at GE was blow up 
the plant you were working in and that it had a profound effect on you. Can you 
explain? </p>
<p><b>Jack Welch</b>: I did accidentally blow up the plant, yes. I was about 25 and had 
been experimenting with a different mixture. There was an explosion. I was 
scared stiff when I went to the manager. But, he was mainly curious as to why I 
had done what I had done and what I had learnt from it. &#8216;Would the process I was 
trying have worked,&#8217; is what interested him! That real encouragement to get it 
right rather than a punishment did have a profound effect on me, yes. (1) </p>
<p>Admit it: you would have fired him. </p>
<p class="quote">The road to wisdom? Well, it's plain and simple to express: <br>
Err <br>
and err <br>
and 
err again <br>
but less <br>
and less <br>
and less <br>
&nbsp;-- <i>Piet Hein, Danish inventor and poet</i>. </p>
<h2>Limiting the damage of failure </h2>
<p>Use pilots to limit the damage when trying new ways of working. The three 
principles of successful pilots are: Think big. Start small. Scale fast. </p>
<p>Another useful phrase to try and embed in your culture to help limit the 
damage of failure is a simple four-word formula that gets the message across: 
<i>Only make new mistakes</i>. </p>
<p>If you can embed this phrase into your culture as a way of managers setting 
expectations, it becomes clear to all that an absence of mistakes is a sign that 
people aren&#8217;t stretching themselves and trying new things. But, it also makes it 
clear that you need to share the learning from mistakes to prevent that mistake 
being repeated. </p>
<h2>Mechanism for spreading learning from mistakes </h2>
<p>Jack Welch again: &#8220;We celebrated mistakes at a management gathering with 
1,000 people in the room. A manager would get up and say why the environmentally 
sensitive light bulb or whatever it was&#8230;had failed&#8230;Then we&#8217;d give them $1,000 or 
a TV or something, depending on the scale of the thing. The point was to share 
the learning and get smarter as an organization.&#8221;(1) </p>
<h3>On the other hand&#8230; </h3>
<p>You will hear again and again in leadership development circles the mantra 
&#8216;Learn from mistakes &amp; failures&#8217;. But, in among the din of all that noisy 
received wisdom, I recently heard one voice point out that there is an uber-message 
about failure; a message that is more important than &#8216;learn from your mistakes&#8217;. 
I heard Bob Geldof say this at the end of 2006: </p>
<p>&#8220;The Bob Dylan line always appealed to me: &#8216;There&#8217;s no success like failure 
and failure is no success at all.&#8217; It was a while before I understood it. 
Leaders need the ability to fail and then get up and go on. <i>It doesn&#8217;t matter if 
you don&#8217;t learn from the failure</i>. But it does matter that you get up and get 
on.&#8221; <br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>USEFUL CONCEPT</b> The Tripping Point (2): Refers to those moments in life where 
you land on your backside and suddenly realize, with blinding clarity, that you 
got it wrong. For great leaders at all levels in an organization, these are 
significant illumination points in life where the shock of failure sears into 
you, you learn, change and, as Geldof says above, get up and move on. And you 
show other people by your own example how to do it. <br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>And, finally&#8230;who&#8217;s this failure? </h3>
<p><i>(Thank you to Professor Aidan Halligan for sharing this with me): <br>
</i>1831 Failed 
in business <br>
1832 Defeated for congress <br>
1834 Failed in business <br>
1835 Sweetheart 
died <br>

the most revered US Presidents in history. </p>
