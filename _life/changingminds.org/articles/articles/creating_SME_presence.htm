Creating A SME Web Presence That Delivers </p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Niall Devitt</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the today&#8217;s business environment the Internet has become an extremely 
powerful business tool. At a minimum it can be used to generate plenty of juicy 
new sales leads or at its full potential delivering a full e-commerce sales 
vehicle and revenue stream. </p>
<p>Unfortunately this been said it still tends to be the very large business 
groups or industry specific groups such as the hospitality sector that use the 
internet to anywhere near its full potential. </p>
<p>Using the Internet for your companies&#8217; business advantage need not be either 
a complicated or costly measure. I believe armed with a little knowledge you can 
start to develop your company&#8217;s web presence so that it will quickly become an 
important part of your business strategy and ultimately deliver plenty of new 
sales and customers. </p>
<h2>Your Website </h2>
<p>Your website is your both your company&#8217;s shop front and product showroom on 
the web. Therefore it&#8217;s critical that you put in some work beforehand and plan 
for its design, wording and creation so that it delivers your company, people 
and products in their best light. Start by asking yourself questions. What do 
you want to achieve from this process? Can your on line presence add to your 
bottom line? </p>
<h2>Goal </h2>
<p>Once someone visits your site they become a potential customer so the primary 
goal of a business website needs to be to guide and encourage the visitor to 
make a positive next step such as giving contact details (leads), picking up the 
phone to call (leads) or making a decision to purchase on line (sales). Don&#8217;t 
forget a web designer&#8217;s business is the look and feel of the site not what your 
customers will want so you are the one that is best placed to manage the 
process. </p>
<h2>About<br>
</h2>
<p>Keeping your primary goal in mind your site is also a source of information 
to your potential customers. In other words, it&#8217;s like a sophisticated on-line 
brochure providing potential buyers with relevant information about the company, 
its people, products and existing customers. What is a potential customer likely 
to want to know about your business to help them to buy your product? </p>
<h2>Text </h2>
<p>The text needs to contain a decent sprinkling of the key words (search terms) 
that your potential customer is going to type into the search bar when searching 
for your product. In this way it&#8217;s very different to a standard hard copy 
brochure and that why it&#8217;s never a good idea to just replicate existing hard 
copy text on line. This bit requires some research beforehand from you. You may 
feel you have a good idea of what people are lightly to be searching for but you 
also need to consider and research less obvious keywords and search terms. Not 
doing this is lightly to be cutting off large numbers of potential visitors and 
ultimately customers. Include all these keywords in the text of the site and 
where possible in the text of your home page. It is also worth considering that 
search engines love new information so where you can stay away from coping or 
replicating existing on line content. </p>
<h2>Pictures and Bios </h2>
<p>It&#8217;s a good idea to include pictures and bios of the main people within the 
company. This allows you to demonstrate to the potential buyer the levels of 
experience within the organisation and show off any relevant qualifications and 
achievements. </p>
<h2>Graphics </h2>
<p>Buck the latest trends and keep graphics to a minimum. While they can look 
good they sometimes create more trouble than they are worth. Heavy graphic 
dependent type-sites are extremely difficult to get a good ranking on Google or 
the other search engines due to the nature of how websites are indexed. Remember 
Information rich sites rather than flashy sites usually win the ranking battle 
within the search engines. </p>
<h2>E-content </h2>
<p>Newsletters, blogs and free advice are a great way of keeping your potential 
customers on the site while also giving you an opportunity to demonstrate your 
expertise in your chosen field. The process of having a visitor sign up for a 
newsletter also provides you with sales leads. </p>
<h2>Links Page </h2>
<p>You also need to create a links page in your site. This is to allow you to 
add relevant links to other sites within your site. You include this page so 
that you can start to exchange links with other sites and build up the back 
links to your site. </p>
<h2>SEO </h2>
<p>Now that you have created your website you first need to get it listed in 
Google, Yahoo and DMOZ. You can wait for the search engines to discover your 
site or alternatively you apply to have your site listed. Yahoo charge for the 
privilege but if you wait they will pick it up. Once this is done your next task 
is to ensure that your site appears high enough up the search engine listings so 
that people actually click through and visit your home page. This is called 
<i>search engine optimisation </i>or SEO for short.</p>
<p>One way to do this is to pay an SEO specialist company to do this for you or 
alternatively you can do it for your self. In simple terms search engine ranking 
is decided by three factors<br>
</p>
<p>1. The number of links backs to your site<br>
2. The quality of these links<br>
3. The relevance to your site of the sites linking in </p>
<h2>Online Directories </h2>
<p>Your first port of call should be on line directories. There are literally 
hundreds of directories out there that will list your site. Some charge for the 
privilege but many don&#8217;t. Be warned this can be a time consuming process because 
you have to enter the details about your site with each application and many 
take months to list your site. Remember try to target directories that are in 
some way relevant to your site i.e. Irish, Industry, business or product 
related. </p>
<h2>Link Exchange </h2>
<p>Exchanging links with other sites is another extremely effective way of 
building up the number of quality back links. Again target sites that are 
relevant to your business. Contact their web or IT person by e-mail or phone and 
propose to list their site provided the return the favour. Ideally you want to 
target sites that have a better or at least similar page rank than yours. To see 
what page rank a site has download the Google toolbar. </p>
<h2>Online Articles </h2>
<p>You can also write articles within your area of expertise and get them 
published online including a link to your site. One way to do this is to set up 
a free account with a site such as <a href="http://www.ezinearticles.com">www.ezinearticles.com</a>. These types of sites 
provide a service that allows their visitors to publish your articles on their 
website or blog therefore creating additional links back to your site. 
Alternatively you can target relevant sites and directly request to have your 
article published. Well-placed articles also deliver quality additional visitors 
and potential customers. </p>
<h2>Google Adwords </h2>
<p>Adwords is an online advertising service provided by Google. You pay to have 
your site listed for specific keywords and search terms. In effect you bid for 
relevant keywords and your site appears somewhere in the sponsored listing 
section. Where it appears depends on the popularity of the specific search term 
and the amount that you are prepared to pay. Adwords is a good way to get 
visitors to your site while you are building up your search rankings. </p>
<h2>Google Page Rank </h2>
<p>Page rank goes from 0-10 (10 being the highest) and is how Google views the 
importance of your website. Building up the number of quality back links is the 
easiest way to achieve a higher ranking. Results take time but it is worth the 
effort over the long term. Download the Google toolbar and you can watch your 
rank increase over time. </p>
<h2>Summary </h2>
<p>Your website should be an effective on line marketing and selling vehicle for 
your company. It can be used to generate good quality leads or be full 
e-commerce revenue stream for your business. Creating a professional business 
website is only the first step, it also needs to appear high enough up the 
search engine listings so as to attract sufficient visitor numbers. Lastly it 
will then need to hold these potential buyers attention and guide and encourage 
them to make a positive next step. This process doesn&#8217;t have to be costly 
provided you are prepared to invest some of your time and energies. What you 
will get back depends largely on what you are prepared to put in. <br>
