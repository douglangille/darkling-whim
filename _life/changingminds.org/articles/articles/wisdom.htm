<h1>Wisdom</h1>

Wisdom</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: </i>Michael Levy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Science has yet to define the meaning of wisdom in scientific terminology. I 
guess they require some type of clever or mathematical proof wisdom exists? 
Perhaps clever humans may not at this time be able to use their sophisticated 
minds to determine the meaning of wisdom, however a few clever people maybe able 
to understand the difference between a clever mind and a mind that can embody 
wisdom.</p>
<p>A clever mind possesses the ability to learn knowledge, skills, logic and 
reasoning, then to perform some or all of them in a brilliant, amazing manner, 
for good or evil deeds. Two examples of devilish cleverness are 9-11 and Enron. 
Both were conduced by very clever minds for evil deeds.. One followed religious 
ideology doctrines to legitimize their acts for their followers. The other found 
greed and power was all they required, so they used their cleverness to rob 
millions of innocent people. Many other lesser known detrimental deeds are 
performed daily all around the world by cunning and conniving cleverness.<br>
</p>
<p>On the other side of the coin, two examples of a clever mind are a conjurer 
who can perform amazing tricks and a person who can invent a computer or 
software that can change every day life for most people on earth. Both clever 
deeds are initially performed for the benefit of humanity, however, a conjurer 
only entertains, whereas the application and use of computers can be used for 
evil deeds by a clever minded person lacking wisdom.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Wisdom is the capacity to distinguish between authentic meaning and erroneous 
meaning, which translates into the adaptiveness to live joyfully in a constantly 
changing world. Wisdom feeds purity of thought and cannot ever be used for evil 
intent, for if it is attempted to be used with a persons cleverness for evil or 
unsound deeds, it ceases to be wisdom. Let's explore two examples of how wisdom 
can be misused, one in religion the other in science ...<br>
</p>
<p>The three main modern religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam have been 
around for a few thousand years. Many wise sayings are quoted on a daily basis 
from the Bible and Koran. They give a guidance on living a joyful life while 
helping other people to enjoy their lives. However, in the process of worshiping 
a God that gives unconditional love, somehow clever thinkers managed to 
indoctrinate hatred and fear into Gods messages. Where is the wisdom in fearing 
a God that gives unconditioned love? Surely, unconditional love that anyone has 
to fear is a paradoxical oxymoron that only a clever mind can dream up and get 
billions of people to believe it!. <br>
</p>
<p>The results are plain to see and history can vouch for the slaughter of 
millions of innocent people in Gods name. So, what started out as wisdom, 
distorts itself and turns into clever doctrines that still today, humbug and 
deceives clever, professional, academic and business people, all who go to 
houses of worship, praying to a God that long ago supposedly killed first born 
babies to free his chosen people, he loved so much that he had to put them into 
slavery to teach them a lesson? <br>
So, the question on religion is ... who captured the wisdom in all three 
religions and where is it hidden? Could clever minds have the answer or does it 
take wisdom itself to figure it out!<br>
</p>
<p>Science is helping people to overcome sickness/disease and it is a noble 
deed. Wisdom in science has been used in many ways to determine the cause of 
illness. Cleverness is then employed to find new medications to treat the 
symptoms. For instance, when then Panama Canal was being built many people died 
of Malaria until one wise mind proved still water breeds insects that carry 
Malaria. He used his wisdom by observing nature at work. Clever people then 
found a drug to aid the bodies recovery from Malaria. When wisdom is combined 
with cleverness humanity goes from strength to strength and all is well. <br>
</p>
<p>Many clever people's recreation time is spent at seemingly enjoying 
themselves by drinking alcohol and eating foods that will induce fatal illness 
sometime in the future... The drug companies take advantage of the clever 
peoples lack of wisdom and advertise drugs with harmful side effects on TV and 
radio to brainwash them into asking their doctors to prescribe the harmful 
drugs...Where is the wisdom?<br>
</p>
<p>The education system teaches students how to read, write and add-up sums. It 
does not teach them how to apply wisdom with their education because wisdom 
cannot be taught by clever people... It can only be directed by wise people who 
will admit they cannot teach it. Wisdom's characteristics can contain, balance, 
insights, intuition, experience, spirituality, logic, reason, knowledge, skills, 
science, religion, prudence, judgments, ethics, morals, virtues, feelings, 
sensibility, however it is not governed, restricted or limited by any of them 
individually. It thrives on truth in intelligent minds and many times is 
thwarted and isolated in oblivion by intellectually programmed clever minds. It 
is said a wise tongue knows when to speak and when to stay silence. 
Unfortunately, for many clever people, their wisdom has a silent communication 
overwrought by a loud knowingness of sophisticated thought.<br>
</p>
<p>In essences wisdom has no academic or literal meaning, for like faith, a 
person knows it if they have it and if it is genuine wisdom it will steer them 
on a path of contented, absolute bliss, for every second they spend on earth. A 
person who receives wisdom in their thoughts can only guide by the example they 
set and the credibility of the life they live. By example, people with wisdom 
stand the test of time. Every baby on earth is born with wisdom dancing in every 
cell and molecule of their being. It can only be hidden by a clever mature mind 
that has forgotten the keys to wisdom's treasures .... La - De - Da!<br>
