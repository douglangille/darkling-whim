Polishing Your Presentation Skills</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Estienne de Beer</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps you think your career does not entail delivering any presentations. 
Well, this is where you might be wrong because no matter what your job is, 
presentation skills ultimately will come into the picture in some ways. This 
article, therefore, focuses on the significance of presentation skills in the 
marketplace and in your career.</p>
<p>You have heard it before &#8230; public speaking is the number one human fear. 
Studies show that this fear ranks ahead of the fear of death for many people. 
Some people are born presenters. Most are not. Hence, you are not alone when you 
say that you do not enjoy delivering presentations and speaking in front of a 
large audience. Stage fright is inevitable. And yet, speak well and you can rise 
to the top of your organization or industry. Good presenters are quickly 
recognized as rising stars and catapult over their &#8220;mouth-full-of-sawdust&#8221; 
colleagues.</p>
<p>Communication is a vital key in this new century. All of us will at some or 
other time chair meetings, deliver presentations, training or workshops, either 
to internal or external customers. It gives an edge to keep abreast with the 
fast pace of the times. Presentation skills definitely work towards this goal. 
Maybe you are up for a presentation delivery soon and you need valuable tips. Or 
perhaps, you see the link between success and effective presentation skills, and 
have realized that effective presentation skills can be a great ally. </p>
<p>The diversity of opinions today in the workplace, which are often 
controversial, has increased the need for presentations. People need to voice 
their views to function well at work. For some four thousand years, public 
speaking has been the key in building and keeping a democratic society and way 
of life. Aristotle said &#8220;a speaker needs three qualities &#8211; good sense, good 
character, and goodwill toward his hearers.&#8221; </p>
<p>Presentations before colleagues can sometimes be a real challenge, if not a 
source of embarrassment; not only to employees, but even to persons of high rank 
such as scholars, scientists, politicians and executives. They may have 
hesitations in facing an audience, often accompanied by sweaty palms, 
stuttering, and the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon. These dilemmas often cause 
untold problems to the presenter (especially in self-expression) and unpleasant 
effects to the audience. </p>
<p>Presenters usually fall into one of four categories. Do you perhaps recognize 
yourself? </p>
<p><i>The Avoider </i>does everything possible to avoid facing an audience. In some 
cases, avoiders seek careers that do not involve delivering presentations. </p>
<p><i>The Resister </i>becomes fearful when asked to speak. This fear may be 
overwhelming. Resisters may not love to deliver presentations, but they have no 
choice. When they speak, they do so with great reluctance. </p>
<p><i>The Accepter</i> can do presentations but is not that enthusiastic to do them. 
Accepters occasionally give presentations and feel good about them. Quite often 
these presentations can be quite persuasive and satisfying. </p>
<p><i>The Seeker</i> always looks for opportunities to speak. Seekers understand that 
anxiety can be a stimulant that fuels enthusiasm during presentations. Seekers 
work hard at building their professional communication skills and 
self-confidence by trying to present often, despite anxiety. </p>
<p>Success in delivery of effective presentations can open a whole world of 
opportunities for your career. It can help you conquer new frontiers. It can 
broaden your horizons through personal development, influence, and advances in 
your profession. </p>
<h3>Presentations Improve Your Personal Development </h3>
<p>There was once a student who dropped a course five times because she hated 
speaking in front of the class. But after a self-study on building up 
confidence, she decided to give it a try and was successful. In fact, she came 
to enjoy the experience so much and even volunteered to deliver more 
presentations. I can certainly relate to this example. I used to harbour an 
extreme distaste of public speaking in any way, shape and form. Today my bread 
and butter comes from a professional speaking career and I passionately pursue 
every single opportunity to give a motivational talk or to conduct a corporate 
workshop. </p>
<p>Through presentation skills tools like research, conceptualization, and 
organization, you have a systematic and effective way of presenting your ideas; 
and thus, you will be able to express yourself better. Inevitably you will also 
become more open to other people in the process. Furthermore, presentation 
skills can launch you into a more significant role as you get recognized. 
Lastly, well-honed presentation skills can satisfy one&#8217;s sense of achievement 
when you add value to an audience. This is one of the strongest motivators to 
further raise your level of communication skills and acumen in this crucial 
developmental area. </p>
<h3>Effective Presentations Benefits Your Organization </h3>
<p>It is not only you who can benefit from the art of communication but your 
organization as well. Most meetings or presentations are exceptionally boring 
and with proper communication skills, you can breathe new life into dull 
boardrooms. And not only that, but good communicators get recognized more often 
and over time get promoted. If you want to get ahead in life and in business, 
there is really no way you can nor should avoid public speaking. </p>
<h3>Presentation Skills Advances Your Profession </h3>
<p>Good presentation skills can boost your career remarkably, and eventually, 
your finances. Usually, success in the business world is gauged by answers to 
questions like, &#8220;Do you hold an MBA degree or something similar?&#8221; However, 
researchers have proven that the best indicator of success in any profession is 
whether the person is often asked to deliver presentations. Those who give more 
presentations tend to have higher salaries than those who give less or no 
presentations.<br>
</p>
<p>The longer you work for an organization and the higher you climb the 
organizational ladder, the more the boss will ask you to preside over meetings 
and to give talks to the staff and subordinates or the clients. The higher your 
position, the more your responsibilities in leading people under you; and the 
more you must speak effectively. A manager once said, &#8220;From the chairman of the 
board to the assistant manager of the most obscure department, nearly everyone 
in business speaks in public or makes a speech at some time or the other.&#8221; </p>
<p>Big corporations and small organizations alike need people who are successful 
presenters, both internally and externally. For example, if salespeople cannot 
present their services or products with a convincing sales pitch, then fewer 
customers and clients would buy their products. Employees of big organizations 
meet regularly to make group decisions that they will present formally to senior 
management. </p>
<p>The bottom line is this: Whichever road you take, you will encounter 
instances that require you to deliver presentations. This begs the obvious 
question &#8230; will you avoid, resist, accept or seek?<br>
