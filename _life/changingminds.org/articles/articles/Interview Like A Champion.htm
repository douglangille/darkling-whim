Interview Like A Champion</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Louis Lautman</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Maybe you have decided that you deserve more money than you are currently 
being paid or maybe you have decided that not having a job and not being paid 
anything must come to an end. You may be looking for a new position in the 
company you are in or you may be looking to jump companies and possibly even 
industries all together. Whatever you situation is, you must face the 
inevitable&#8230;The Job Interview.</p><p>
Why so many people have given this process a negative connotation, is because 
they do not know the proper steps to take to interview like a champion. Being a 
champion interviewer like any other skill takes practice. When you were a kid 
and first learned how to ride a bike, chances are you fell off a few times 
before you were burning rubber on your first two wheeler. The same goes for 
interviewing like a champion, your first interview ever may have a few flaws, 
but after going on a couple of interviews and reading the remainder of this 
article, you will be an interviewing powerhouse.</p><p>
First you must establish what kind of job you want. In order to do this I like 
to say, what do you love to do? If money was not an object, what would you do 
for a living? Maybe you would help out in a hospital, teach children, or maybe 
you enjoy the roller coaster ride of a salesperson, manager or work in human 
resources. What ever it is that you enjoy, you can increase your chances of 
being happy on the job is you are working in a job that you enjoy. In addition 
to the kind of job, you must enjoy the atmosphere of your working environment 
and industry.</p><p>
So you know what you like, now are you really able to perform this type of job? 
If you are five foot two and weigh 250 pounds, you probably shouldn&#8217;t expect a 
job in the NBA. Finding what you love and what you are qualified for really 
takes some soul searching and should not be rushed. Take a look at what you do 
in your free time, are you doing something you love? If money wasn&#8217;t an object 
what would you be doing? Is it possible to take these two and find a job in this 
area? If you enjoy traveling, would a job in travel interest you? If you enjoy 
building things, would a job in construction interest you?</p><p>
Once you have figured out what you enjoy, it is time decide what job you believe 
you qualify for that is in your area of interest. It is best to choose at least 
three different companies in this industry that suit your needs. You don&#8217;t have 
to necessarily choose an industry if it is just the position that you enjoy, but 
why not obtain a position in an industry that you really enjoy. Working in an 
industry that you enjoy as well as having the position that you enjoy will add 
to your day to day happiness on the job. If you believe you have found the 
company and are working in it already, you have one foot in the door and are a 
step ahead of those coming in from the outside. Do not get to comfortable 
though, because the prize always goes to the person who wants it the most&#8230;this 
is true for everything in life, not just interviewing.</p><p>
You have picked the industry and narrowed your choices down to your top three 
companies in that industry. Hopefully you have done this by looking at many 
things such as the size of the company, the location of the company (how long is 
the commute from home), the companies reputation in the industry and many other 
things that you can imagine you would need to look at in working for this 
company.</p><p>
Next you must look at the position available in that company. Is the position 
available (if it is not today, it does not mean that you can&#8217;t earn that 
position, it just may take some real champion interviewing), what are the 
requirements for that position, who would you be reporting to, what is the 
working environment like and of course how much can you make at this position. 
These are just some of the many things you will want to consider when deciding 
on a job.</p><p>
You have narrowed down you choices and have your top 3 companies in mind that 
are aligned with your values and are ready for the interview&#8230;or are you? Sure if 
you believe you are, but like the master craftsman - measure twice&#8230;cut once. Why 
have you picked these three companies to work for? List as many reasons as you 
can possibly list for each company on paper&#8230;yes on paper. This will allow you to 
go back to this list before your interview to study so you can have an answer 
when asked the question &#8220;Why do you want to work here?&#8221; </p><p>
Get ready because the follow up question to the preceding question is &#8220;Why 
should we choose you for this position? What do you have to offer to us that 
someone else doesn&#8217;t?&#8221; Am I suggesting that you have answers to these questions 
already scripted out before the interview&#8230;yes! In fact, you should know the 
answers to these questions even before you make your first contact to set up the 
interview.</p><p>
Now it is time to set up the interview. Hopefully when you were contacting the 
companies to ask questions about the positions available and about the company 
itself, you were friendly and built rapport with everyone you talked to (for 
more on rapport, please read my articles on building rapport). As you are 
setting up the interview it is a great idea to befriend some workers in the 
company to get the &#8220;inside scoop&#8221; on the job, the company and the person(s) 
interviewing you. These will be good contact to have to prep you for the 
interview, especially because today interviews are becoming more and more 
complex.</p><p>
It is best to find out the appropriate way to apply for the job, not all of us 
are fortunate enough to be drinking a cup of Joe in a run down cafe next to a 
successful movie producer like in the movie &#8220;Sullivan&#8217;s Travels.&#8221; If dad owns 
the company, you can promise to wash his car and mow the lawn, but chances are 
good that someone in human resources or the hiring manager will give you their 
companies&#8217; process of landing that dream job. </p><p>
I believe in The Top Down Theory, where you go right to the top of the company 
and they refer you to the person responsible for the hiring decision. How does a 
referral from Bill Gates sound to you, that is if you can get a hold of the 
person at the top. If not a simple phone call, personal letter, fax or e-mail 
should do. When setting up the interview do not sell them on hiring you on the 
phone, your main concern should be booking the interview, who knows who or what 
is on the other end of the phone. The in person interview is where the true 
champion thrives past the unprepared person.</p><p>
You have the interview booked, now what? What are you strengths and weaknesses, 
define them, yes on paper, and ask others who know you to define them for you as 
well. This will really give you an opportunity see if you see yourself the way 
that others see you. Get to know what kind of questions will be asked in the 
interview and role play with people, remember sloppy practice equals sloppy play 
and outstanding practice equals outstanding play. What questions would you ask 
someone hiring for the positions. Know the questions, know and believe your 
answers because you can see trepidation when someone does not believe in what 
they are saying.</p><p>
Interview day, this is where the champion shines. I will not get into appearance 
in this article (if you would like to know more about appearance, check out my 
article Dress For Success), but needless to say you should look the part of a 
successful employee in the position you are interviewing for whatever the attire 
calls for wear it, and groom yourself accordingly. Review you notes about the 
company, yourself and why you are their best choice. Visualize the interview and 
imagine any questions that may be asked of you and have answers for them.</p><p>
Unless you are applying for a job as a mafia hit man, I would suggest smiling at 
everyone. Nothing is more becoming than someone who brightens a room with a 
beautiful smile. Not only is it contagious, but people will want to be around 
you because you must be smiling about something good about yourself. This may 
even have the interviewer wondering what is so great about you that you are 
smiling and you may even be offered the job. In addition to your smile, please 
be friendly to everyone, yes everyone. You never know who is who in the office. 
The CEO may have just decided to take a seat for a moment in the lobby, wouldn&#8217;t 
that be great if you were smiling and acting friendly.</p><p>
Here comes the interviewer. With a friendly warm smile shake hands and let them 
lead you to where the interview will take place. Please shake hands like you 
want the job, the dead fish handshake really is a turn off (for more on 
handshakes, check out my article (Who You Are Is Speaking So Loud That I Can&#8217;t 
Hear What You Are Saying). The person giving the interview will probably take 
the lead and let you know that the interview will probably look something like 
this (This is how the most common interview is structured, for more on unique 
interviews check out my article Now That&#8217;s An Interview). First they will ask 
you questions about yourself, they will tell you about the company and position, 
and then ask why you are a fit. You will master that question because of all 
your outstanding practice. Finally they will ask if you have any questions. You 
should have at least one if not several. The one you should have is if you can 
have the job. This will show confidence and that you mean business, if you are 
this powerful in the interview, the interviewer will think that you will be just 
as powerful in the job. Confidence is the most important thing to have on an 
interview, if you are not confident about yourself, why should the person 
conducting the interview be confident about you? (For more on confidence, check 
out my article Confidence&#8230;Fake It Till You Make It.)</p><p>
In regards to questions, you should also ask them to clear up anything that you 
did not understand when they were giving you information about the company and 
position. You should also ask anything else that you want to know about 
anything. It is said that the quality of your performance is judged by the 
quality of your questions. Outstanding questions get outstanding answers&#8230;and 
people who ask outstanding questions, must be outstanding&#8230;wouldn&#8217;t you agree?</p><p>
If you are not offered the job on the spot, kindly thank the interviewer for 
their time and when you get home, send a thank you letter or e-mail for their 
time. This shows that you respect them and their time. What if they had to 
decide to hire you or someone else and you were both even for the job, but the 
other person didn&#8217;t send a thank you card, who do you think they would hire?</p><p>
You should be contacted in a week or two and if not, follow up with a phone call 
inquiring about the job. If you got the job great (check out my article First 
Day On The Job), if not you should have two other employers getting back to you 
if not at least two more interviews to go on.</p>
