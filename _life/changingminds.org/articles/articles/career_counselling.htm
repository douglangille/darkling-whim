Career Counselling</p>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Margaret Francis, MSW, M.Phil,PGDCIM</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Career counselling is nowadays an emerging field in counselling, which gives 
relevant information regarding different career. Career Guidance helps the 
students to select the career according to their choice and interest. Career 
counselling is now being increasingly stressed as an integral part of 
education. In order to secure the right job, the right career choice is foremost in 
the minds of every job seeker with /with out professional qualifications. The 
demands of the modern age are very complex. In addition to the right kind of 
job, and the right approach in this direction.</p>
<p>The original approach to formal vocational counseling is generally traced 
back to Frank Parsons (1909). Parsons became interested in unemployed school 
leavers and developed a counseling service in the Boston Civic House, a social 
settlement. In 1909, he published a book (Choosing <i>a Vocation</i>) in which 
he structured the three steps of vocational counseling as he viewed them in 
practice: self-analysis, occupational analysis, and true reasoning or counseling 
to relate personal and occupational information. Since Parsons' original 
contribution, a variety of approaches to career counseling have been developed 
representing a rich range of intellectual perspectives. Differential, 
developmental, social learning, cognitive, sociological, economic, and 
mathematical models have all been used. </p>
<p>Career Counselling can be defined as the process of helping and enabling 
people in their career development. Career counselling and guidance may involve 
both face-to-face help or may be mediated through telephone, letter, text, or 
even the internet. However, most important of all remains the one-to-one 
interview between the career counsellor and the client. A career counsellor 
would be facing clients who are making career decisions and choices or coping 
with life changes, which relate to their working life -- career changes, 
redundancy and unemployment.</p>
<p>In 1981, Crites used this model and methods of career counseling to define 
the unique parameters of a given career counseling approach and provide a schema 
for synthesizing the approaches (trait-and-factor, client-centered, 
psychodynamic, developmental, and behavioral). The methods of career counseling 
are more pragmatic than theoretical and attempt to translate the model into 
operational terms (Crites, 1981). They include the interview techniques used by 
the counselor, the test-interpretation procedures engaged in by the client and 
counselor, and the acquisition and use of occupational information.</p>
<p>Career Counselling is a life long process since the individual choose an 
occupation, prepare for it, and make progress in it. Career Counselling has to 
do with knowing their interest, selection of their subject, formation of their 
study habit and make them progress in those subject and activities and attain 
the ultimate aim of getting good career as per their wish. </p>
<p>It is concerned primarily with helping the individual to make decisions and 
choices involved in planning for future and to form career decisions and choice 
necessary in affecting career adjustment. It stands to take necessary care of 
the interest of the individual.</p>
<p>Career counselling is a personalized process that combines both intuitive and 
cognitive techniques to help to understand oneself, explore career options, and 
clarify and attain desired career goals. The processes of career counselling 
offer insight, guidance and support to help students to understand and manage 
different career and lifestyle issues. <br>
Jones et al. (1970) proposed that the following five assumptions underlie the 
trait-factor conception of vocational development: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Vocational development is largely a cognitive process in which the 
  individual uses reasoning to arrive at his decision</li>
  <li>Occupational choice is a single event</li>
  <li>There is a single right goal for everyone making decisions about work.</li>
  <li>A single type of person works in each job.</li>
  <li>There is an occupational choice available to each individual</li>
</ul>
<p>Career counselling and guidance generally involves face-to-face interaction 
and interaction through telephone, letters, or Internet. However, most important 
of all is the one-to-one interaction between the career counsellor and the 
client. A career counsellor deals with people who are making career decisions 
and choices or coping with changes like- choice of subjects, career changes, and 
redundancy. The matter of career decision, and a student's direction and 
progress towards professional goals often play a crucial role in the development 
of individual identity and purpose, as well as positive self-esteem and 
interpersonal functioning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Career counselling acts as a process of self-exploration and interest, 
identification of the client and helps in career choice and decision 
making. Career counselling, thus spans both the internal psychology of the person 
and external context of education and employment.</p>
<p>Career counsellor helps the student s to evaluate their abilities, interests, 
talents and personality characteristic to develop realistic academic and career 
goals. Career counsellor also helps the individuals make career decisions after 
exploring and evaluating their education, training, work experience, interest, 
skills and personal traits and arrange for aptitude and achievement tests. This 
helps the individual to develop job search skills such as resume writing and 
interviewing techniques.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Career counsellors should know in broad terms how one occupational field 
differs from another and the different levels each jobs within each field. A 
wide knowledge of career opportunities is essential for career counsellors, so 
that the counsellor will be able to give appropriate suggestions at the career 
planning stage and also assesses the client&#8217;s view of the opportunities and can 
be provide information on existing career. Based on the client&#8217;s wish, 
counsellor can help him/her to choose a career according to his/her wish.</p>
<p>In the College, the management should take the initiative in installing 
career/behavioural counselling as part of its infrastructure. It should convince 
the students and the parents about the advantages of counselling by removing any 
misgivings and being open about the system. A broad knowledge of career 
opportunities will be available through effective career counselling.</p>
<h2>Qualifications for a career counselor </h2>
<p>Searching for a professional to help improve any aspect of your life takes 
time. It is important to know about the person's qualifications, experience, and 
style of practice. Even though all counselors are different, and your session 
should be tailored to your specific needs, there are some actions that all 
counselors should be able to perform</p>
<ul>
  <li>Conduct personal counseling sessions to help you clarify career goals
  <ul>
    <li>Administer and interpret tests to assess your skills and interests, to 
    help identify career options</li>
    <li>Plan career exploratory activities through assignments </li>
    <li>Provide exercises for improving decision-making skills</li>
    <li>Help you to develop a personal career plan</li>
    <li>Teach strategies for job search </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Skills and assist in the development of resumes.<ul>
    <li>Provide support for those experiencing job stress, job loss, and career 
    transition<br>
    Like other professions, career counseling has filled with guidelines, 
    certifications, special distinctions, and ethical standards. Most counselors 
    have some level of certification. </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Career Consultant</h2>
<p>The recent years the new title &#8220;consultant &#8220;popularised .the consultants have 
special insight into the field though they don&#8217;t have related academic degrees. 
But they are offering good practical support in real life training.</p>
<h2>Career Counselor</h2>
<p>Career Counsellors are professionals who hold degrees in related areas, such 
as Counseling or Psychology, who have chosen to concentrate in the field of 
career development. Their strength is the academic training they receive in 
counseling, helping them to understand how different personalities work in a 
professional setting. As counselors advance in education and experience level, 
there are higher levels of recognition they may receive.</p>
<p>As per the National Career Development Association, a person could be 
certified on one of the following levels as a Career Counsellor. </p>
<ol>
  <li>The National Certified Career Counsellor is a title held by a person who 
  has a graduate degree in counselling or a related professional field from an 
  accredited institution, completed supervised counselling experience which 
  included career counselling, acquired a minimum of three years of full-time 
  career development work experience, and successfully completed a 
  knowledge-based certification examination. </li>
  <li>In 1999, the NCDA retired this title, and made all who held it into Master 
  Career Counsellors. Other qualifications, professionals hold a master's degree 
  in counselling or related field and have been active as an NCDA member for a 
  minimum of two years. An MCC has at least three years of experience in career 
  counselling and must successfully complete a supervised career counselling 
  practicum. MCCs are skilled in administering and interpreting career 
  assessments and provide the highest quality of career counselling services</li>
  <li>The Master Career Development Professional (MCDP) is an NCDA member who 
  holds a master's degree or higher in counselling or related field. The MCDP has 
  at least three years of postmaster&#8217;s career development experience in 
  training, teaching, program development, or materials development. </li>
  <li>The Fellow is an NCDA member of professional distinction. A Fellow 
  designation recognizes outstanding and substantial contributions to career 
  development in science, teaching and training, practice, service, policy 
  development, and political action. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Holland Theory</h2>
<p>Based on Holland Theory related to career, there are six basic types 
individuals like Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising and 
Conventional. They prefer their career as per their basic type.</p>
<p>The descriptions below are giving a brief idea of each of the types.</p>
<p><u>Realistic</u> type individual&#8217;s prefers the careers like mechanical 
engineer, production planner, building inspector, safety engineer, and marine 
surveyor etc. They enjoy working outdoors, and like to work with tools and 
machines. This type of people generally prefers to work with things rather than 
people.</p>
<p><u>Investigative</u> Individuals consisting of this category are biochemist, 
orthodontist, anthropologist, economist, researcher, and management analyst. 
They have usually has mathematical and scientific abilities, enjoys working 
alone, enjoys research, and likes to solve problems. They prefer working with 
ideas rather than with people or things. </p>
<p><u>Artistic</u> Individuals likes careers such as architect, copywriter, 
technical editor, story editor, composer, stage director, interior decorator, 
and commercial designer. They enjoys creating original work, and has a good 
imagination. They prefer to enjoy working with ideas rather than things. </p>
<p><u>Social</u> type individual choose social careers such as teacher, clinical 
psychologist, psychiatric caseworker, personnel manager, paralegal assistant, 
and speech therapist. The have social skills, is interested in human 
relationships, and likes to help others with problems. They work with people 
rather than with things. <br>
Enterprising individuals prefer the careers such as public relations 
representative, financial planner, real estate agent, sales representative, 
stockbroker, and attorney. They have skill in leadership and speaking abilities. 
They likes to work with people and ideas rather than things.</p>
<p><u>Conventional</u> individuals prefer the careers such as accountant, cost 
clerk, bookkeeper, budget analyst, and business programmer. They enjoys working 
with words and numbers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vocational development is the process by which individuals choose a career 
path or occupation. Individuals continue to develop vocationally throughout 
their lives, and many have several major careers as personal needs and interests 
change.</p>
<h2>Choosing a Career</h2>
<p>The career counsellor should assess following areas through that the 
counsellor can help the clients while choosing a career.</p>
<ul>
  <li>aptitude </li>
  <li>skills </li>
  <li>personality </li>
  <li>The level of responsibility that suits him/her</li>
  <li>interests </li>
  <li>needs </li>
  <li>priorities </li>
</ul>
<h2>Evaluating a Job Offer</h2>
<p>The career counsellor also able to help the counsellee to assess the job 
offer. A good job offers give opportunities to learn new skills, increase 
earnings, and rise to positions of greater authority, responsibility, and 
prestige. When they receive a job offer, they will be able to take apt decision 
that whether they accept the job or not.<br>
Thus, a career counsellor plays a very vital role in taking career decision by 
the counsellee.<br>
