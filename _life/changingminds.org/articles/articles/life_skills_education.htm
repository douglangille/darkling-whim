<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Margaret Francis<br>
&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>Youth are considered as the most productive members of the society, due to 
their physical and intellectual capacity. But it is sad to recognize the fact 
that most of the youth are unable to utilize their potential in an appropriate 
way due to lack of guidance and motivation. Now a days a large number of youth 
engaged in antisocial activities which create a lot of social problems like 
alcoholism, drug abuse, sexual abuse, smoking etc. These habits deteriorate 
their physical and intellectual capabilities and also seem to be a burden to the 
society. Youths are engaged in many antisocial activities and which adversely 
affecting other members of the society. These high risk behaviors affecting 
society in a large extend. This new challenge requires immediate and effective 
responses from a socially responsible system of education. It may be noted that 
to date, no university or board of school education has come forward to initiate 
such a programme in the country which may be beneficial to our young people. In 
this connection life skill education plays a very vital role to increase the 
awareness among the youth about all social problems and to alleviate social 
evils from the society. Life skill education helps the individual to improve the 
decision making skill, ability to take every thing in the right sense and also 
improve their contributions to the society.</p><p>
<b>Life skill</b>: A skill is a learned ability to do something well. Life skills are 
abilities, individuals can learn that will help them to live a fruitful life. 
Life skills are defined in the Targeting Life Skills (TLS) Model (Hendricks, 
1996) as &#8220;Skills that help an individual be successful in living a productive 
and satisfying life.&#8221; </p><p>
<b>Meaning of Life Skill</b>; The abilities for adaptive and positive behavior that 
enable individual to deal effectively with demands and challenges every day life 
(WHO). It further encompasses thinking skill, social skill and negotiation 
skill. It also helps the young people to develop and grow into well behaved 
adults.</p><p>
Life skill education aims to provide students with strategies to make healthy 
choices that contribute to a meaningful life. Life skills are the abilities that 
help to promote mental well being and competence in young people as they face 
the realities of life. It helps the young people to take positive actions to 
protect them selves and to promote health and meaningful social relationship. 
Life skill facilitates a complete and integrated development of individuals to 
function effectively as social beings.</p><p>
Life skill education is a value addition programme for the youth to understand 
self and able to assess their skill, abilities and areas of developments. Which 
also enable them to analyze their capacity to enhance the function in a most 
productive way. Life skill education allows the youth get along with other 
people, able to adjust with their environment and making responsible decision. 
Which also incorporate to build up their values and to communicate effectively. 
In many circles, reproductive health education, population education and family 
welfare education are interchangeably used to convey the same meaning. The main 
objective of life skill education is to enable the learner to develop a concept 
of oneself as a person of worth and dignity. It should help one to understand 
oneself and lead to growth in personal responsibility. </p>
<p>Life skill education is a basic learning need for all young people. It will 
help the young people to empower in challenging situations. Various skills like 
leadership, responsibility, communication, intellectual capacity, self esteem, 
Interpersonal skill etc.extends its maximum level, if it is practicing 
effectively among the youth. We need to create life skill education as the 
cornerstone of various youth programmes. An effective implementation strategy 
will help the youth to practice it in their life. Specific activities like 
leadership training, communication, interaction, understanding self, making 
decisions, working with groups, socialization etc added the quality of youth.
</p>
<p>Developing life skill helps the adolescents to translate knowledge, attitude 
and their health behavior such as acquiring the ability to reduce specific risk 
behavior and adopt healthy behavior that improve their lives in general. Life 
skills have produced the following effects: lessened violent behavior; increased 
pro-social behavior and decreased negative, self-destructive behavior; increased 
the ability to plan ahead and choose effective solutions to problems; improved 
self-image, self-awareness, social and emotional adjustment; increased 
acquisition of knowledge; improved classroom behavior; gains in self control and 
sociability; better handling of interpersonal problems and coping with anxiety; 
and improved constructive conflict resolution with peers, impulse control and 
popularity.</p><p>
Skill based approach in life skill education follows well established mentoring 
techniques to develop students innate quality and also motivating them to adopt 
socially acceptable pattern of life style&#8217;s particularly, strategy consisting of 
a group of people combined together to help themselves by identifying their 
talents and directing them to choose an appropriate steps to enhance their skill 
and abilities as a part of development. Proper feed back are necessary from the 
trainer as well as the peer groups to an individual to improve their confidence. 
Through the experiential learning process, youth internalize the knowledge and 
gain the ability to apply the skills appropriately. </p><h2>
Life skill education Strategies</h2><p>
Life skill covering the areas like leadership, ethics, accountability, 
adaptability, personal productivity, personal responsibility, people skill and 
self direction. Leadership skill enables the person to solve problems, attain 
his/her life goal and the ability to motivate others and also achieve a common 
goal. Person will meet the high standard of accomplishments by following the 
ethics in his/her personal as well as professional life. He will be able to 
adapt different roles and responsibilities. They are able to tolerate ambiguity 
and willing to change their priorities as per the requirement. Thus they will be 
committed to their work by utilizing the time more effectively. Life skill 
education will be effective only when people are able to act upon the skill 
which they have learned. In mental health and other areas, there is a 
considerable improvement in behavior with the help of life skill education. Life 
skill education lays the foundation for learning skill, which is greater demand 
in job market. Life skill education enhances self direction of the individual. 
He/She will be able to monitor his or her own understanding and learning needs. 
And also has the commitment to learning as a life long process.</p><p>
A life skill programme could include content about friendships, bullying, sexual 
relationships, anger management, perceptions about drug use. The Key basic 
categories of life skills including communication, negotiation, refusal skills, 
assertiveness, cooperation, empathy. Cognitive skills including problem solving 
skills, understanding consequences, decision making, critical thinking, self 
evaluation. Emotional coping skills including managing feelings self management 
and self monitoring.</p><p>
In order to have an effective implementation of life skill education there is a 
need for professionally trained and skilled personal from within the country. 
Professional training requires a purposely planned programme of study prepared 
by experts which has the approval of a competent authority. There is an urgent 
need to train and prepare a large contingent of &#8220;trainers of trainers&#8221; (TOTs). 
The TOTs will require adequate training on all aspects of the subject. They have 
to be expert in this field of study in order to be effective in performing their 
task.</p><p>
Through life skill education one can move towards a more positive and holistic 
approaches in order to educate the new generations and through them the future 
generations. </p><h3>
