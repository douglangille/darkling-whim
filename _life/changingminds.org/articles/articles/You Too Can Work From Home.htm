You Too Can Work From Home</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Louis Lautman</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of us dream of waking up at noon, to our delicious brunch that the maid 
prepared, only to jump on the computer for an hour and spend the rest of the day 
relaxing on the beach or by the pool with our mate and kids playing by our side. 
The only stress we imagine having is whether to have the butler drive us in the 
Rolls Royce or should we jump in the Ferrari up the coast. Yes you can have this 
lifestyle with a home based business, but it does take a little work to get 
there&#8230;well maybe a lot of work.</p>
<p>Many of us see the commercials late at night of people just like you and I who 
have &#8220;made it in life&#8221; when they left their minimum wage job to start their very 
own home based business and are now mega-wealthy. What sets these people apart 
from me you ask yourself as you finish off your last Budweiser and eat the last 
piece of stale pizza before you call it another night. The answer is 
determination. We all can say that we want to live the lifestyle, but it is 
these people who have proven to be determined to live it because they are as you 
are reading this. Don&#8217;t worry, it is not that long and after reading this you 
will well be on your way to owning your own home based business.</p>
<p>Today 85% of people in the US hate their jobs and 95% of people want to own 
their own business. However, 70% of businesses fail in the first 3 years. A 
successful owner is a good consumer, compares prices and buys the lowest prices. 
There are many reasons why people do not open their own business; the first is 
fear, you must control it or it will control you. To do this put a face on fear, 
what is it and is that really a reason not to open your own home based business. 
The second of the main reasons is the opinions of other people. People stop us 
because they love us and don&#8217;t want to see us get hurt or don&#8217;t want us to be 
more successful than them.</p>
<p>If you are really determined read below and decide that you will start your own 
home based business today. I am not suggesting that you quit your job yet and go 
full time at home, though if you follow the proper steps, this will be the 
inevitable. The first thing to do is decide what kind of home based business do 
you want to start. You should find a growth industry or product that is 
recession proof, has low overhead, is a convenience that creates necessity, has 
broad appeal, is not available in retail stores, produces exciting, emotional 
response, is easy to use, consumable, priced competitively, has a money back 
guarantee and whose timing in market is good.</p>
<p>One of the easiest ways to have a successful home based business is to model a 
successful home based business. Look for a market that already exists and know 
the margins, they must be at least 4:1. Market the solution immediately and 
easily, solve a problem rather than prevent one because people will always pay 
more for the solution than the prevention, if you want proof talk to someone who 
has gotten cancer from cigarette smoking. You don&#8217;t need to find anything new, 
just d it better and remember there is always a market for the best.</p>
<p>So you found your product now what, in your spare time get an additional phone 
line with voice mail and caller ID and an 800#. Build a website, get 
incorporated with a tax ID number, think of a business name, print up some 
business cards, and you are good to go. I am going to suggest selling 
information on the internet. First I will address reasons to sell something on 
the internet as apposed to a product. 
</p>
<p>The first reason to sell something on the internet is the convenience and timing 
of the transactions, with improved and affordable web technology and e-commerce 
solutions, people can shop from the convenience of their own home 24/7. An 
internet business is easy and quick to start and readily accessible instantly. 
You will save money and make money easily because an internet business is the 
least expensive to start, operate and market. There is hardly any overhead and 
lots of tax breaks (to find out more on the tax break of a home based business, 
check out my article Hey Uncle Sam, I Run A Successful Business From My House). 
Web traffic is doubling every 100 days, so there are more prospective customers 
out there for your products and information. Today there are over half a billion 
people on line and that number is growing every day. Thirty trillion dollars 
will be exchanged on the internet this decade; do you want a piece of that?</p>
<p>Now that you agree you should have a business on the internet, allow me to share 
with you why selling information on the internet is your best choice. There are 
minimal production costs, once you have the words on file, if you bought them or 
they are your intellectual property; that is all of your cost of production. 
There is minimal production time, once an order is in, a copy and paste is all 
that is in order before you send a file. There are no inventory concerns because 
everything is on file in your computer and there is instant delivery to a global 
market with automated 24/7 sales and distribution. There are minimal marketing 
costs because the majority of your marketing is done over the internet. Ongoing 
revenue streams can be built into the product by continually marketing to your 
customer and you can promote yourself as an industry expert. You can also 
promote your offline business to the world on your website for free. Best of all 
the value of your content is determined by the information, not the production 
cost, this can lead to a pretty profit.</p>
<p>If you are not fired up, you better check you pulse. Tomorrow when you are at 
your J.O.B. (Just Over Broke), ask yourself is the life that I have always 
dreamed about, or can I succeed at a home based business. You can have your new 
home based business set up and running during your lunch hour. (For ideas on a 
home based business check out my article, Home Based Business Ideas.) For now, I 
look forward to seeing you enjoying life the way it was meant to be enjoyed&#8230;by 
your rules. Just remember, if your home based business is going to succeed, the 
word is determination.<br>
