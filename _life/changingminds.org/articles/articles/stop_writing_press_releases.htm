<h1>Stop Writing Press Releases. Start Writing News Releases</h1>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="../articles.htm">Guest articles</a> &gt; 
Stop Writing Press Releases. Start Writing News Releases</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Philip Yaffe</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recommending that you stop writing press releases and start writing news 
releases is not a play on words. It is sound advice. </p>
<p>In common parlance, &#8220;press release&#8221; and &#8220;news release&#8221; mean the same thing. 
However, the terminology people use often betrays a fundamental difference in 
how they put this information together and how well it is accepted by the media.
</p>
<p>Early in my career, I was editor of a daily newspaper and later a writer with 
The Wall Street Journal. One of my jobs was to screen submissions to decide 
which ones we would print and which ones we would throw away. </p>
<p>Approximately 80 - 85% of submissions failed the first screening, a life or 
death decision usually made within 60 seconds or less. On the other hand, the 
vast majority of those that survived this first screening also survived the 
second one and were ultimately published. </p>
<p>What made the difference? Basically, it was in how the author of the document 
viewed the material being submitted. </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Losers</b>. Information a company or organisation wanted to see printed 
  for its own benefit.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Winners</b>. Information a company or organisation wanted to see 
  printed for its own benefit and the benefit of our readers. </li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, the submitter had something to gain if we published the 
release, i.e. positive publicity. However, in the first case, the focus was on 
only how the submitter would benefit from publication. In the second, it was on 
both how the submitter <i><u><b>and</b></u></i> our readers would benefit. </p>
<h2>A Concrete Example </h2>
<p>If all this sounds a bit theoretical, here is an example to make it more 
concrete. </p>
<p>After leaving <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, I was an account executive with 
a major international press relations agency. One of my subordinates presented 
me with a typically self-serving press release he wanted to distribute on behalf 
of his client. </p>
<p>The headline was something like: <i>Egotistical Industries gains major new 
contract</i>. The first paragraph said something like: </p>
<p class="quote">Tom Bighead today announced that Egotistical Industries has won 
a $350,000 contract to supply window sealants for the new sports centre 
currently under construction in Baden-Baden, Germany. Egotistical Industries was 
founded in 1989 by Mr. Bighead and his brother George, and is now considered to 
be the leading company in its field. Last year the company&#8217;s sales were . . . .&#8221;
</p>
<p>In the fifth paragraph, if anyone would read that far, we learned that the 
sealant the company would supply had the property of not freezing in cold 
weather, so work on the sports centre could be carried out in December, rather 
than waiting for warmer weather in March or April. </p>
<p>This of course was the true story. If you are a reader of a professional 
construction magazine, you couldn&#8217;t care less that Egotistical Industries has a 
new contract. By contrast, you could be vitally interested in knowing that you 
could possibly gain three months on your construction schedule by using 
Egotistical&#8217;s product. </p>
<p>More importantly, editors of professional construction magazines would view 
the release this way. </p>
<p>Remember: Editors are vitally concerned about what their readers want to 
read, because if they lose readership, they lose their jobs. The real target of 
your release must be the editors. They are the gatekeepers. <i>If they value the 
release, it gets published; if they don&#8217;t, it doesn&#8217;t. </i></p>
<p>We therefore rewrote the information into a news release with the headline:
<i>Windows in Baden-Baden Sports Centre will be sealed in the dead of winter, 
saving the contractor approximately $30,000 in labour costs</i>. The first 
paragraph, and as many additional paragraphs as necessary, elaborated on this 
very attractive theme. The background information about the company came at the 
end of the release where it justifiably belonged. </p>
<h2>The Short Road to Nowhere </h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s another example. As a marketing communication consultant, I was asked 
by a client to write a release announcing an important new service. I was told 
to limit the release to 400 words. &#8220;Why 400 words?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s our 
policy to keep our releases short. Journalists like that.&#8221; </p>
<p>The problem was, I couldn&#8217;t find a way of saying everything that needed to be 
said in only 400 words. The client was insistent. I finally produced something 
at 400 words which the client felt was exactly what was wanted. But when the 
release was issued, no one published it. </p>
<p>The client called a few newspapers and magazines to find out why. The answer 
was, they just didn&#8217;t see anything that would be of interest to their readers. I 
then called a couple of these newspapers and magazines and asked, &#8220;Do you think 
you readers would be interested in X.&#8221; &#8220;Yes, why didn&#8217;t you put that in the 
release?&#8221; </p>
<p>Well, I had. But under the stricture of the 400-word limit, it had become so 
severely condensed as to be cryptic. It was there&#8212;if you knew what to look for. 
The function of an effective release is to give information, not challenge 
journalists to find it. </p>
<p>I rewrote the release. This time it came out to 650 words and was widely 
published. Why? Because it had been transformed from a press release, i.e. what 
the client wanted to say, into a news release&#8212;what journalists believed their 
readers wanted and needed to know. </p>
<p><br>
Each time you start tapping at the keyboard, keep uppermost in mind the aspects 
that make a release a &#8220;news release&#8221;. </p>
<ul>
  <li>First, a release gets published only if editors feel that it offers 
  something their readers want and need to know. So make certain that it does.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Second, there is no &#8220;correct&#8221; length for a news release. To paraphrase a 
  sexist joke (I apologise, but it is just too pertinent), a news release should 
  be like a miniskirt: short enough to be interesting, and long enough to cover 
  the subject.</li>
</ul>
