<h1>Leaders Take Real Control</h1>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="../articles.htm">Guest articles</a> &gt; 
Leaders take real control</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Andrew Burnham</p><p>
&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>Leaders lose the capacity for authentic, creative and measured responses by 
allowing their buttons to be pushed. By learning how to be in the moment, 
leaders and others take control and remain calm and centred in challenging 
situations and with difficult people. </p>
<h3>What do we look for in leaders?</h3><p>
We admire and appreciate leaders who are calm and centred in difficult 
situations. We are more comfortable trusting and following people who stay 
focused on constructive action. This is true across cultures and times. We look 
to people who are not adversely affected amidst chaos and are able to make 
decisions. </p>
<h3>How do we want to be as Leaders?</h3><p>
As leaders we are not satisfied with merely appearing calm in challenging 
situations and with difficult people, we want to be calm. We also want to be 
authentic, creative and action oriented. We cannot evidence these qualities 
consistently nor are we walking the talk of leadership when we our allowing our 
buttons to be pushed. </p>
<h3>Making Wise Use of Limited Time</h3><p>
Can you afford the time it takes to become and stay agitated? Agitation has an 
uninspiring effect on others. When conditions are right agitation in the leader 
becomes productivity loss in the team and rising costs for the organization. As 
leaders we now have two problems and no solutions. </p>
<h3>Buttons</h3><p>
When someone or something pushes our buttons we are having a negative reaction. 
A negative reaction is simply an automatic and uncontrolled way of processing 
what is happening. The &#8216;what happens out there&#8217; starts to negatively affect our 
&#8216;in here&#8217;. </p>
<h3>Where are our Buttons?</h3><p>
Start the process of reducing and eliminating your buttons by considering the 
following: If a golf ball hits you on the head is the pain in the golf ball or 
is the pain in you? &#8220;Of course, the pain is in me&#8221;, you say. It&#8217;s easy to see 
that our reactions are not in the difficult people or challenging situations 
themselves. Our reactions are clearly in us so why not look for solutions where 
they really are and not where we are unlikely to find them? </p>
<h3>Stick to the Facts</h3><p>
As far as being in the moment is concerned, we only deal with the facts. And all 
we know is what we experience. What the golf ball experiences and what is going 
on in the minds of the difficult people we encounter is unknown and 
inconsequential. Knowing what is going on in the minds of others doesn&#8217;t change 
the fact that we are still agitated and have buttons. For this reason, it&#8217;s far 
more useful to pay attention to what is going on in our own minds and leave the 
speculative thinking for later. </p>
<h3>The Problem is not &#8216;Out There&#8217;</h3><p>
We sometimes erroneously think that it is the other person or the situation that 
is responsible for our stress. Our focus is not on the real problem. Thinking in 
this way puts everyone and everything else in control, paves the way for 
problems to recur again and again, and leaves us floundering when we can least 
afford it. </p>
<h3>Being Response-able</h3><p>
Being responsible begins with developing an awareness of what our attention is 
directed to. This is being in the moment and it&#8217;s the most practical place to 
be. When we are in the moment we are &#8216;response-able&#8217;. </p>
<h3>Take Action or Take Attention Away</h3><p>
Take constructive action right here and now to change the situation or person if 
this is possible. There is no agitation or stress in this approach. Is something 
bothering you right now? What can you do about it? If there is nothing that can 
be done right now, in this very moment, then what is the value of continuing to 
focus on it? </p>
<h3>Where is the Problem?</h3><p>
If we can control or change the other person or situation, then that is where 
our focus would be right now. Where is the problem now? If we can do something 
constructive then that is what we are doing in the moment. As we start to learn 
how to process our work and our interactions with others in this way, what we 
can control on the outside also increases. </p>
<h3>Be Vigilant, Be Aware</h3><p>
When our buttons are pushed, our reactions usually occur with lightning speed. 
Being in the moment creates space between the outside and event and our reaction 
to it. Cultivating this awareness is the key to trading our self-defeating 
reactions into authentic responses. We respect and trust leaders who are 
authentic. </p>
<h3>Quick Change</h3><p>
Once we become aware that we have just picked up a searing hot pan we put it 
down. That is what awareness is like. And once we realize that we can trade our 
reactions in for responses, dealing with difficult people or situations is no 
longer a problem and change is easy. We don&#8217;t pick up the hot pan anymore. </p>
<h3>Focus on What Is</h3><p>
It&#8217;s not difficult to see that many things and people should be different. But 
does dwelling or stewing on what or who should be different change anything? 
Continuing to dwell on our own make-believe worlds does not create solutions. 
Deal with reality as much as you can. Are you going to take action now or are 
you going to dwell on what should have happened or how someone should be 
behaving? </p>
<h3>Focusing on the Wrong Things</h3><p>
As our thinking becomes less automatic we notice some telling things. We 
actually see in real time when and how our thinking has gone off the rails. For 
example, we directly realize that dwelling on the shortcomings of others doesn&#8217;t 
diminish their faults nor does it make our own leadership qualities grow. 
Powerful and immediate learning like this is par for the course as we learn how 
to be in the moment. To realize something is to know something directly and it's 
the quick way to long and lasting change. </p>
<h3>What is Being in the Moment Like?</h3><p>
Leaders and others who are in the moment experience the same challenges as 
everyone else. The critical difference is that they create no negative reaction 
and are in control. They actively work for change and solutions without any 
negativity, loss of time or wasted energy. Another way to say this is that these 
leaders don&#8217;t make a problem out of what is happening in the moment and have 
unlimited access to all of their skills. </p>
<h3>In the Moment Questions</h3><p>
&#8226; What is my mind now focused on?</p><p>
&#8226; Is what I am focused on leading to action?</p><p>
&#8226; Can I take action now or am I just dwelling on something without results?</p><p>
