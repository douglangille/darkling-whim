Coaching That Counts</p>

</b>
<p>Coaching is a profound leadership mindset, but you have to believe in it 
first. Andrew Wood explains the big picture as follows: &#8220;Leadership is not a 
right of passage, or at least it shouldn't be. Leadership is a state of mind. A 
philosophy. An attitude. Understanding this, you can recognize and develop the 
key traits that will enhance and improve your personal capacity for leadership.&quot; 
Great leaders touch the lives of their followers through coaching. The key to 
consistent business success is to understand that people come before 
spreadsheets. The personal growth and coaching of their employees is put on top 
of the priority list and soon the results on the spreadsheets will follow. </p>
<p>When you hear the word &#8220;coach&#8221;, what comes first into your mind? Do you 
picture a sports team with someone shouting out directions? Or perhaps a 
frowning manager pacing to and fro and calling out the names of the players? 
Coaching is no longer reserved for sports teams; it is now one of the key 
concepts in leadership and management. So why has coaching become so popular in 
the business world? </p>
<p>Coaching levels the playing field. </p>
<p>Coaching is one of the six emotional leadership styles proposed by Daniel 
Goleman. Moreover, it is a behaviour or role that leaders enforce in the context 
of situational leadership. As a leadership style, coaching is used when the 
members of a group or team are competent and motivated, but do not have an idea 
of the long-term goals of an organization. This involves two levels of coaching: 
team and individual. Team coaching makes members work together. In a group of 
individuals, not everyone may have nor share the same level of competence and 
commitment to a goal. A group may be a mix of highly competent and moderately 
competent members with varying levels of commitment. These differences can cause 
friction among the members. The coaching leader helps the members level their 
expectations. Also, the coaching leader manages differing perspectives so that 
the common goal succeeds over personal goals and interests. In a big 
organization, leaders need to align the staffs&#8217; personal interests and goals 
with that of the organization so that long-term direction and strategy can be 
pursued. </p>
<p>Coaching builds up confidence and competence. </p>
<p>To take any company or team to the top, you can't treat employees as digits. 
That is why I dislike the term &#8220;human resources&#8221; &#8230; it is expendable. But not a 
&#8220;human asset&#8221; approach. This means that in both theory and practice, people come 
before projects. You will never reap the right kind of financial numbers until 
you truly invest in the coaching of your people. This is the ultimate 
competitive advantage in the business world. Individual coaching is an example 
of situational leadership at work. It aims to mentor one-on-one building up the 
confidence of team members by affirming excellent performance and behaviour 
during regular feedbacks; and increase competence by helping the individual 
assess his/her strengths and weaknesses towards career planning and professional 
development. Depending on the individual&#8217;s level of competence and commitment, a 
leader may exercise more coaching behaviour for the less-experienced members. 
Usually, this happens in the case of new employees. The manager gives more 
defined tasks and holds regular feedbacks for the new staff, and gradually 
lessens the amount of coaching, directing, and supporting roles to favour 
delegating as competence and confidence increase. </p>
<p>Coaching promotes individual and team excellence. </p>
<p>Excellence is a product of habitual good practice over a period of time. The 
regularity of meetings and constructive feedback is important in establishing 
these habits of excellence. Employees catch the habit of constantly assessing 
themselves for their strengths and areas for improvement that they themselves 
perceive what knowledge, skills, and attitudes they need to acquire to attain 
team goals. In the process, they attain individual excellence as well. An 
example is in the case of a musical orchestra: each member plays a different 
instrument. In order to achieve harmony of music from the different instruments, 
members will polish their part in the musical piece, aside from practicing as an 
ensemble. Consequently, they improve individually as an instrument player. </p>
<p>Coaching develops high commitment to common goals. </p>
<p>A coaching leader balances the attainment of immediate targets with long-term 
goals towards the vision of an organization. As mentioned earlier, with the 
alignment of personal goals with organizational or team goals, personal 
interests are kept in harmony. By constantly communicating the vision through 
formal and informal conversations, the members are inspired and motivated. 
Setting short-term team goals aligned with organizational goals; and making an 
action plan to attain these goals can help sustain the increased motivation and 
commitment to common goals of the team. </p>
<p>Coaching produces valuable leaders. </p>
<p>Leadership by example is most crucial in coaching. Coaching leaders lose 
credibility when they cannot practice what they preach. This means that coaching 
leaders should be well organized, highly competent in their field, communicates 
openly and encourages feedback, and has a clear understanding of the 
organization&#8217;s vision-mission-goals. By vicarious and purposeful learning, team 
members catch the same good practices and attitudes from the coaching leader, 
turning them into coaching leaders themselves. If team members experience good 
coaching, they are most likely to do the same things when entrusted with formal 
management roles. </p>
<p>Some words of caution though: coaching is just one of the styles of 
leadership. It can be done in combination with the other five emotional 
leadership styles depending on the profile of the emerging team. Moreover, 
coaching as a leadership style requires that you are physically, emotionally, 
and mentally fit most of the time since it involves two levels of coaching: the 
individual and the team. Your team members expect you to be the last one to give 
up or bail out in any situation especially during times of crises. A leader must 
be conscious that coaching entails investing time on each individual, and on the 
whole team. Moreover, that the responsibilities are greater since while you are 
coaching members, you are also developing future leaders as well.</font> </p>
