Demystifying Co-Counseling</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: </i>Bharati Rao Pothukuchi, MA. PG Dip(Couns)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Studies have indicated that there are not as many counselors in India as are 
the people with problems Suitable individuals can therefore be given short 
training to work as group counselors, peer counselors, or co-counselors, to 
answer the emotional and psychological needs of society in a period of 
transition from the joint family to a nuclear family pattern. </p><p>
Co-counseling is particularly relevant in the Indian context in the areas like 
Tsunami affected regions, in earthquake affected regions like Gujarat wherein 
trauma has been great, and lot of death and rehabilitation has occurred. Many 
people still remember the pain and suffering that happened because of Tsunami. 
Such people have to be taken care of, and volunteers who are helping these 
trauma affected people can be trained in co-counseling techniques. What was the 
psychological support given to the relatives of Bhopal gas victims is not known. 
At least those people who have witnessed disasters more recently can be provided 
some psychological support by training them in co-counseling. Volunteers 
equipped with this skill can be prepared to face unforeseen disasters. </p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p><p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Counseling is a relatively recent addition to the range of 
human service professions in India. It is still an evolving field Counseling 
came as an answer to the human relations problems that occurred when there was a 
change in the structure of society. I.e. there was breakdown of joint families, 
and there was a gradual transition to a more individual centric society. 
Agencies other than family started having a hold on the individual because of 
breakdown of joint families. Counseling is one such field that came into 
existence as an answer to the emotional needs that surfaced as society gradually 
changed to a more individual centric pattern. </p><p>
Counseling can be defined as a professional relationship between a trained 
counselor and a client, wherein the counselor helps the client to be well 
adjusted, efficient, and well-balanced to tackle problems that come up in daily 
life They will then be able to contribute their maximum to society Counseling is 
a subject in itself, and counselors are given intense training to do counseling.
</p>
<h2>Types of counseling</h2><p>
A number of variations of traditional counseling have come up. They are very 
different from traditional counseling; Examples are group counseling, 
peer counselling, co-counseling and so on. . All these are in response to the 
need for help in the area of counseling, because of the fast life and changing 
social scenario. People have started needing more and more help to sort out 
their life issues. Studies have indicated that there are not as many counselors 
as are the people with emotional problems. Hence the need for people who can 
attend to these specific problems. Suitable individuals can therefore be given 
short training to work as group counselors, peer counselors, or co-counselors.
</p><h3>
Group Counseling</h3>
<p>
Group counseling takes place in groups. Means attending to 
specific nonpathological problems that client are aware of and which do not 
involve major personality changes. For example group counseling may involve 
helping clients achieve goals such as relating better to families, becoming 
organized, or relaxing in the presence of superiors at work. The groups are 
normally 10 to 12 people in number, and formed in educational institutions or 
agencies. The group leader is the one who co-ordinates the group counseling 
session. For example, if a group of new employees are facing a tough time with 
their boss they may form a group to discuss the differences they have with their 
boss. After coming to a consensus, the group leader can sort out the differences 
with the boss. </p><h3>
Peer Counseling</h3>
<p>
Life can be stressful at college. Sometimes students need 
someone with whom they can discuss roommate problems, academic distress, long 
distance relationships, or other personal issues like child abuse, suicide and 
so on. . The Peer Counseling Program helps the students to settle down and do 
well in college, or university .Peer counseling is done on a one to one basis by 
a student volunteer in consultation with a professional counselor.</p><h3>
Co-Counseling</h3>
<p>
Another variant of the counseling process is Co-counseling. Co-counseling 
is very different from traditional Counseling. Co-counseling was originally 
formulated in 1957by American Harvey Jackins through a combination of his 
personal experiences gained in counseling sessions.</p><p>
Salient features of co-counseling Co-counseling is used in case of occurrence of 
natural calamities like earthquakes, floods, etc.or in case of riots, huge fire, 
etc. Here the calamity is great and the need for mental health workers is more 
because people have gone through a traumatic experience. In such cases the 
clients sometimes need to work out their stress by way of crying, shouting 
weeping etc. In co-counseling, the clients work out by crying, shouting, 
etc.when the counselor is available. In turn the client becomes a counselor and 
listens to such outpouring from the person who was the counselor before. Since 
the number of mental health workers available is lot less than those needed, the 
people available (and interested in counseling) are given short training to 
handle such emotions. They work under the guidance of a professional counselor.</p><p>
Methodology for co-counseling In this there are two people alternately acting 
out the role of counselor and the counselee for a mutually agreed fixed period 
of time. There is a basic agreement between two people, that each person takes 
turn being the counselor (the person listening) and the client (the person being 
listened to.) This is usually done in pairs. This exchange is called &#8216;having a 
session&#8217;</p><p>
However in co-counseling a person who is counseling will maintain total silence 
when he is in the role of the counselor, but when the same person is in the role 
of client, he will speak to the heart&#8217;s content. In other words in co-counseling 
the fundamental meaning of the process is, &#8220;I scratch your back and you scratch 
my back. </p><h3>
Differences between Traditional counseling and Co-counseling</h3><p>
In contrast to traditional counseling, in co-counseling you can have a session 
with any co-counselor at any time that suits you. You can have it anywhere- in 
your room, home, over phone. The rules in co-counseling appear less rigorous 
than traditional counseling. . There is no time fixed for the session as such, 
the only thing is the agreement between the two co-counselors to share the time 
equally. If co-counselor A is going to spend 1 hour with co-counselor B, the 
co-counselor B has the right to have 1 hr with co-counselor A. Since the person 
who is going to be counseled, is trained in being a co-counselor too, the 
co-counselor need not explain what the process that is going to be followed is. 
Gifts are not accepted and friendship not made between the co-counselor in order 
to maintain objectivity in counseling </p><p>
One important difference between a co-counseling session and just talking about 
your problems to your friend is that you can put your full attention on the 
other person with the knowledge that you&#8217;ll get your own turn to talk too, 
wherein the other person will listen to what you are saying. Co-counseling 
sessions are timed, so that both the persons get equal time to be heard. </p><p>
Co-counseling is not traditional therapy. The co-counselor offers care and 
attention to the client. Thereafter, the person who has first been a 
co-counselor switches role and becomes a client .The client of the first part 
should be prepared to switch roles and be supportive and appropriate as a 
counselor in the second round. In order for this to happen, both the parties go 
through a short course to learn the approach.</p><p>
The emphasis is on lightness and encouragement, because the approach is 
specifically designed for people with no other training. It is very important 
that the two do not do anything that is harmful. Unlike in traditional 
counseling, wherein the counselor is in charge, here it is the &#8220;client&#8221; who is 
in charge. It is the client who decides everything. What are the tools to be 
used, what are the techniques to be used, the timing for the session and all? 
There is a mutual contract between the two people.</p><p>
Co-counselors are not given the kind of rigorous training that traditional 
counselors get. Traditional counselors are taught techniques like empathy, self 
disclosure, immediacy, confrontation etc. These techniques are not taught to 
co-counselors as part of their training. One very important rule that 
co-counselors have to follow is that they should not be meeting at a social 
level. They should also not discuss their sessions once they are over. This is 
to minimize the problems of transference and counter transference. In this 
aspect the traditional counselors and co-counselors are similar. Traditional 
counselors also do not socialize with the clients for better counseling 
sessions. </p><p>
One can become neither a Counselor nor a co-counselor, if one is not able to 
give undivided attention to others, if one is under the influence of alcohol, or 
if one is only prepared to observe other people but not willing to open up to 
the other person.</p><p>
What is the chief characteristic that makes co-counseling so special?. In 
co-counseling the client can discharge emotionally by way of crying, screaming, 
sweating, yawning, and relaxed non-repetitive talking. The whole experience is 
cathartic and the person who is in the counselor role has to patiently listen to 
all of it, nonjudgementally. The counselor will in turn have his/her share of 
talking it out. The concept of co-counseling has been very popular with 
oppressed groups (like women, colored races, refugees etc.)</p><p>
The co-counseling session first starts with a workout of a sad event (if any) 
and ends with a description of a happy event, so that by the time the 
co-counseling session is over, the participants disperse happily. In this 
respect a traditional counseling session and the co-counseling session are both 
different. In a traditional counseling session there is no work out of a sad 
event at the beginning of the session. Also there is nothing like a ventilation 
session wherein emotions like screaming, crying etc are done. The emphasis is 
more on helping the client solve his problem (if any) </p><p>
Also there is a strict theoretical approach that is followed when traditional 
counseling is going on. Such leaning on a theoretical approach is not there in 
co-counseling. The skills learnt in co-counseling are more short-term, and 
temporary, and the counseling help given is also chiefly for emotional 
distressing. </p>
<p>Now the question that arises is whether by being a co-counselor, one can 
become a counselor or a better counselor. The answer is &#8216;NO&#8217;. The skills needed 
for both are very different. While co-counseling operates on very simple tools 
basically hinging on active listening, traditional counseling process needs a 
counselor to be a skilled helper. Also in traditional counseling process, the 
emphasis is not on emotional distressing alone. </p><p>
Co-counseling is particularly relevant in the Indian context in the areas like 
Tsunami affected regions, in earthquake affected regions like Gujarat wherein 
trauma has been great, and lot of death and rehabilitation has occurred. Many 
people still remember the pain and suffering that happened because of Tsunami. 
They suffer the memories. Such people have to be taken care of, and volunteers 
who are helping these people affected by Tsunami can be trained in co-counseling 
techniques. In a country where counseling itself is in its infant stages, 
co-counseling is still more new. However this form of counseling can be used for 
the improvement of disaster ridden areas. Also volunteers equipped with this 
skill can be prepared to face unforeseen disasters;</p><p>
