Sales Recovery: How To Manage a Sale Going Wrong</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Sharon Drew Morgen</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you know the difference between which prospect you&#8217;ll close and which one 
you&#8217;ll lose? </p>
<p>How can you tell, midway through a sale, whether you&#8217;re on track for success 
or you&#8217;ve lost the deal? </p>
<p>How can you tell when you&#8217;ll be unsuccessful in advance and cut short your 
time and energy to offer more time for those who are able to buy? </p>
<p>All prospect situations seem to be going along successfully until they 
aren&#8217;t. You work hard to find the prospect who has appropriate need and 
interest. You do your front end due diligence. You promote and pitch the product 
professionally. You follow the process of objections, time delays, surprises. 
You even project a time when the sale will close &#8211; much to your manager&#8217;s 
dismay. And you hope, hope, that this time all of your hard work will pay off. 
But it&#8217;s a guess. </p>
<p>There seems to be no way of knowing which prospect will actually close, and 
which one will disappear forever into choices you have no control over. </p>
<h2>Out of the loop</h2>
<p>How do you end up being wrong so often? Most calculations state that from 
first prospecting call to close, only approximately 7% of your prospects will 
make a purchase. If that&#8217;s true &#8211; or anything close to that number is true &#8211; 
you&#8217;re wasting, say, 90% of your time. What&#8217;s even worse, you believe that 
you&#8217;re going to be successful until far into your time wastage. </p>
<p>I know I personally sometimes either deny signs that a sale might be going 
south, or arrogantly believe I can save the day somehow. </p>
<p>But the reality is, as outsiders, the only data you have is either data your 
prospect has chosen to share, or from your own best guess based on similar 
situations. </p>
<p>One of the problems is that you&#8217;re basing your hopes and guesswork on 
historic patterns &#8211; buyers who have bought given the same fact pattern, or 
problems you know your product can resolve and seem to be a perfect fit. It 
seems logical that the new prospect should buy if they want their problem 
solved. </p>
<p>As an outsider to the buyer&#8217;s unique cultural norms and mental models, you 
have no way of going into the team or Problem Space of the prospect because you 
don&#8217;t live there with them. You don&#8217;t know their internal politics, or the 
complete set of people issues that must be managed; you don&#8217;t know exactly what 
is maintaining the problem that your product can solve &#8211; if the prospect knew 
how, the problem would have been solved &#8216;yesterday&#8217; (and why wasn&#8217;t it??); you 
can&#8217;t know all of the hidden agendas, the office politics, the historic problems 
that must be resolved before a purchasing decision can happen. </p>
<h2>Changing the possibilities</h2>
<p>Let me tell you a story about how assumptions get us into trouble. It&#8217;s not 
specifically about how a sale was lost without knowing why, but a story of how a 
sale never got to happen because the sales approach was wrong and the seller 
didn&#8217;t know how to recognize what didn&#8217;t work. It&#8217;s the same premise: operating 
from the assumption that the seller 'knows' what&#8217;s going on and doesn't 
recognize his own approach as being part of the problem. </p>
<p>I know this tale intimately: it happened with a new member of my team who was 
recently trained and just getting his head around the difference between selling 
and helping someone manage all of the elements necessary for a buying decision.
</p>
<p>My salesperson told me he was having problems getting a good response from a 
specific industry when he made cold calls. He was quite frustrated because he 
only had a finite number to call, and asked what he&#8217;d do when he&#8217;d completed all 
calls in the category without a sale. It was obvious to him that we were in the 
wrong industry, given the responses he was getting. </p>
<p>When I asked him what he was doing, he shared a scenario that made it clear 
that he was using conventional sales techniques, and hence received conventional 
responses. Here is how one of his conversations went: </p>
<p class="quote">Seller/John: Hello. My name is John from Morgen Facilitations. This is a 
sales call. Is this is a good time to speak? [So far, so good.] </p>
<p class="quote">Prospect: Sure. I&#8217;ve got a few minutes. What are you selling? </p>
<p class="quote">John: A new paradigm sales training. How are you currently bringing new 
thinking into your team to enhance their skills? [Good job, John. On the money.]
</p>
<p class="quote">Prospect: We purchase scripts that we have designed especially for our 
product. We&#8217;ve used this scripting service for a long time, and we&#8217;re happy with 
them. They give us the results we seek. </p>
<p class="quote">John: So what I hear you saying is [Good so far.] that you are happy with a 
result that might be less than what you could be getting if you were using a 
different sales model [LOST IT. Told the guy he&#8217;s stupid.] </p>
<p class="quote">Prospect: I&#8217;m really satisfied with our results and don&#8217;t want to change 
anything. Maybe you can call back in a year or so when we&#8217;re in the market for 
new training, and we can take another look then. Thanks for the call. </p>
<p>John did what so many sellers do: attempt to lead the buyer to the conclusion 
that they need the seller&#8217;s product, and in the process they don&#8217;t acknowledge 
the buyer&#8217;s success, historic decisions, internal systems, company politics, 
vendor relationships, staff comfort. And the prospect shuts down. </p>
<p>John&#8217;s final assessment was that the buyer wasn&#8217;t interested. It never 
occurred to him that anything he was doing might have caused the response, and 
he had no insight into what was really going on internally. Indeed, John had no 
way of knowing whether there was interest or not. The response he got was a 
buyer reacting to a stranger who attempted to get him to change to something 
unknown, and who told him metaphorically that his historic decisions were 
stupid. He did all he could do: he left the interaction. John set up the buyer&#8217;s 
response and blamed it on the buyer. </p>
<h2>Support the solution design</h2>
<p>But look at the new possibilities if you have the buyer add in the 
considerations necessary for him to consider changing. Here&#8217;s what I would have 
said, using Buying Facilitation questions and summary: </p>
<p class="quote">I hear that you have a system in place that has worked for you over time and 
that you have been extremely happy with. What would you need to think about to 
consider the possibility of adding a new skill set to your current methods in 
case there might be even more success possible? </p>
<p>Other Facilitative Questions might be: </p>
<p class="quote">What would you need to know about a new model to recognize that it might fit 
into your values and brand? </p>
<p class="quote">How would you know that new material, such as we have, would even have a 
possibility of working in your work situation? </p>
<p>And, later into the conversation: </p>
<p class="quote">Given you&#8217;ve had the scripts in place for so long, how would you need to 
manage the team learning to ensure they could add something new without causing 
them distress or loss of revenue? </p>
<p>A prospect's response to this exchange would be thoughtful, get him 
considering decisions he had made, and open up new possibilities without 
threatening existing internal systems. </p>
<p>With the proper decision directing questions the Facilitation process helps 
the prospect design a solution and direct him through the range of decisions 
he'd need to manage anyway if he were to make a change by purchasing your 
product. </p>
<p>This is the aspect missing from the &#8216;selling&#8217; model and what keeps sellers in 
the dark: buyers are fighting hidden internal systems that maintain their status 
quo and until they address these monsters they can&#8217;t buy. Anything that rears 
its head must be addressed, and whatever has been used in place of your product 
- whatever people or rules or relationships or politics or historic systems that 
have any touch-points around the decision to bring in a new solution &#8211; will keep 
the process from moving forward. </p>
<p>By having your communication based around product placement (and your 
information gathering and relationship building are all based on ultimately 
placing product), you remain out of the loop with no way for you to take any 
lead on the change that needs to occur within the prospect&#8217;s environment. The 
best you can do is to direct the buyer in the area your product can solve; you 
can&#8217;t get in there with him to help him formulate his own system of change.</p>
<h2>How to know when it's not working</h2>
<p>Here is what you&#8217;ll hear when the sale is going wrong: </p>
<ul>
  <li>One of our partners just contacted us and might be able to help us straighten 
out our problem; </li>
  <li>We have a new initiative starting soon. We&#8217;ll need to wait until we&#8217;re farther 
along on the implementation before we can move forward; </li>
  <li>There has been so much change here. I&#8217;d like to speak with you again in 6 months 
when things have calmed down here; </li>
  <li>I think we&#8217;re going to continue using what we&#8217;ve got for now. Can you call in 
about 3 months and see if we&#8217;re ready then? </li>
  <li>The people who have given us our current X are coming up with a new product that 
might be able to do what we want. It won&#8217;t be out for 2 months, but we&#8217;ll need 
to wait &#8216;til then to trial it. </li>
  <li>I&#8217;ll need to run this by a few more people. </li>
  <li>We need to make sure we&#8217;ve got the budget for this. </li>
  <li>We were thinking of a solution that is a bit simpler than what you and I have 
come up with. We&#8217;re either going to have to scale this back, or wait &#8216;til there 
is budget next year. </li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever the excuse, it&#8217;s built around an internal system that you are unaware 
of and can lead to surprises. From where you stand, you can only see a problem 
that your product resolves. I recently heard a conventional sales person doubt 
that he, personally, would have missed a long-standing problem that delayed a 
large sale by years &#8211; even when the people who missed this issue were 5 very 
very senior partners of a well-established international consulting group who 
were partnering with every single &#8220;C&#8221; level exec. Oh&#8230; the arrogance of our 
profession! </p>
<h2>What to do</h2>
<p>Once you hear any of the above objections (or any others), you can actually 
get back in the game by using the Buying Decision Funnel and lead the prospect 
through all of the decisions that need to be managed in order to make a new 
decision. The Funnel will lead the prospect from strategic to tactical decisions 
that her entire system will have to address. We&#8217;re talking about CHANGE here, 
not just about solving the identified problem. </p>
<p>Remember that the prospect does not seek your product: she seeks to resolve a 
business problem and your product may help her do that. And she will not 
consider making a purchase until she&#8217;s tried every conceivable approach to 
solving the problem with resources already familiar to her (go to 
<a href="http://www.newsalesparadigm.com/buyfac.html">http://www.newsalesparadigm.com/buyfac.html</a> 
and read up on the sequence of buyer&#8217;s decision making). Your new job is to ask 
systems-based questions that will lead the prospect to her own answers &#8211; not use 
information-based questions that will help her buy your product. [Should you 
wish to learn more about this, go to <a href="http://www.buyingfacilitation.com">www.buyingfacilitation.com</a> and purchase my 
ebook Buying Facilitation: the new way to sell that expands and influences 
decisions]. </p>
<p>Here are a couple of examples to help you move the prospect through their 
decisions when you hear that the sales is stuck: </p>
<p class="quote">What I hear you saying is X and that your timing might not be what we first 
discussed. What would you need to know or do differently in order to have ready 
whatever needs to be managed in order to move forward when it&#8217;s the right time?
</p>
<p class="quote">How would you know that my product would offer a solution that your team 
would be able to adopt and recognize as a reliable alternative/addition to what 
you&#8217;re currently using? </p>
<p>Of course, I can&#8217;t give you all possible Facilitative Questions here as they 
need to be formulated as per the conversation. Just note that when formulating 
the questions, include systems elements surrounding the perceived problem 
(including roles, rules, relationships, politics, vendor management, etc.) not 
just questions that help YOU determine a &#8216;need&#8217;. Keep reminding yourself that 
your prospect has a much bigger issue than your product can solve, and that the 
only person who can resolve their issues are inside the organization. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s not rocket science, but truly demands a different mindset as Buying 
Facilitation supports the front end of the sales cycle that has been hidden 
until now. Indeed, it's a systems approacht to collaborative decision making and 
not the selling method. </p>
<p>You have had no choice but to base your closing predictions on the content of 
what prospects say, rather than managing the system that they operate within. 
But now you can help prospects manage their actual internal buying decision 
system. This will put you on the buyer&#8217;s team, uncover three times more 
prospects, and close sales 600% faster than with conventional sales. </p>
<p>Do you want to sell? Or have someone buy? </p>
