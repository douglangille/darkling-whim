Finding The Right Sales Talent For Your Company</p>
<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>by: Lee B. Salz</i><br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Hiring sales talent is one of the most critical activities a company 
performs. However, few are adept at hiring the right people for their firm. This 
article shows you how to hire the right talent.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>I recently had the opportunity to speak to a group of CEOs about their sales 
recruitment needs. To make a point, I mentioned to them that my friend, Willie 
McMoney, had heard that I was speaking to this group and asked that I mention he 
was looking for a new sales home. I shared Willie&#8217;s background with the group: 
Willie has a Bachelor&#8217;s Degree from a well-respected institution, has a great 
look, has been selling for over ten years for household name companies that 
offer low-price products, and has exceeded quota each of the last three years. 
That being said, I asked the group who wanted to hire Willie. Most raised their 
hands in earnest. </p>
<p>I shared with the group that there were a few more details to discuss before 
a decision could be finalized. The information to consider was the profile of 
their company, which included the following attributes: they were a start-up 
with no name recognition in the marketplace, positioned as a high value/high 
price provider, and required customization for each client. I asked the group 
again about hiring Willie. The light bulbs started turning on. They began to 
recognize that finding a great salesperson is not a one-dimensional exercise; 
rather, it requires that the company look within to determine the necessary 
skills and attributes for someone to be a great salesperson in their 
environment. The term &#8220;great&#8221; is the issue here. Willie is a great salesperson 
and he has the credentials to prove it, but the question is: will Willie succeed 
in your company? </p>
<p>Consider this: companies spend thousands, if not tens of thousands of 
dollars, defining their ideal client. They hire firms to help them analyze their 
approach and identify the audience, as well as how to reach them. When I asked 
this group to share with me the attributes of their ideal client, I felt like a 
game show host. The group came to life and was shouting out answers non-stop. I 
strategically interrupted them and asked them to share with me the attributes of 
their ideal sales person. After hearing the deafening sound of crickets 
chirping, I shared what I often heard as attributes of this ideal: someone who 
is very strategic, solution-oriented, sells on value, experienced, and a strong 
seller. The group sighed in relief as they thought I had let them off the hook. 
Not so fast! I asked them how they can hire talent to match that scope. How can 
recruiters translate that criteria into a project whereby they can laser-focus 
their approach and produce the right candidates? The relief disappeared from the 
room and was replaced by angst. </p>
<p>Hiring sales people is the business equivalent of formulating a marriage&#8230; a 
sales marriage, that is. Appearance may be enough to initiate the relationship, 
but without deep commonality of needs and values, the future of the marriage is 
bleak. Why does that matter? The expense of sales turnover is truly 
immeasurable. Sure, you can measure cost of turnover, recruitment, and training 
but how do you place a value on the damage caused by sending the salesperson of 
the day into the same accounts over and over again? &#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m Ben this week&#8217;s 
salesperson representing Widgets We Make. I&#8217;m here to help with your needs.&#8221; </p>
<p>The way for employers to avoid this peril is to develop a profile of their 
ideal salesperson. This profile requires the executive team to collaborate and 
be truly honest about the interworkings of the company in order to produce an 
effective exercise. The profile includes three primary components: product 
characteristics, buying process, and organizational attributes.<br>

  <table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="90%" cellpadding="6" id="table1">
    <tr>
      <td>
      <h3>1. Product Characteristics </h3>
      <p>a. What is the nature of the product(s) being sold? Is it tangible, 
      abstract, or concrete?</p>
      <p>b. What is the nature of the buying relationship? Is it a one-time, 
      transaction sale or a repetitive, complex one?</p>
      <p>c. Is the product a component of something broader (niche) or is it a 
      comprehensive solution?</p>
      <p>d. How recognizable is the product and company in the marketplace of 
      your buyers?</p>
      <p>e. In contrast to the competition, where is the product priced?</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div align="center">
  <table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="90%" cellpadding="6" id="table2">
    <tr>
      <td>
      <h3>2. Buying Process</h3>
      <p>a. What are the expectations of the salesperson with respect to 
      prospecting? Are you generating leads or are they expected to 
      self-generate them?</p>
      <p>b. How long is the buying process? </p>
      <p>c. Is the product &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; or does it require the salesperson to 
      creatively build a solution?</p>
      <p>d. At what level is the purchasing decision made? Who are the other 
      buying players that influence the purchasing decision?</p>
      <p>e. What sales support is available for the salespeople? Is the 
      salesperson required to go from end to end or is the salesperson only 
      required to handle certain parts of the process?<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div align="center">
  <table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="90%" cellpadding="6" id="table3">
    <tr>
      <td>
      <h3>3. Organizational Attributes</h3>
      <p>a. How flexible does someone need to be to survive in your environment? 
      Think in terms of how often the organizational structure changes the 
      compensation, and/or the territory.</p>
      <p>b. What is the sales management approach? Is the sales manager a 
      hands-on coach or a distant observer of performance?</p>
      <p>c. What are you willing to teach to a salesperson? The product? 
      Prospecting? Product positioning?</p>
      <p>d. What aren&#8217;t you willing to teach to a salesperson? Sales 101? 
      Prospecting?</p>
      <p>e. What corporate baggage does your company have? What are the oddities 
      that make it challenging for a salesperson to succeed in your environment? 
      Is there a difficult individual in your company? Are there technical flaws 
      that make it challenging to sell the product? This one requires true 
      introspection and honesty.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>With this exercise complete, you are ready to formulate your ideal 
salesperson profile which looks like this: </p>
<p><br>
We want a salesperson who is experienced at selling</p>
<ul>
  <li>A product with the following attributes&#8230;</li>
  <li>In a buying process that includes&#8230;</li>
  <li>For a company characterized by&#8230; </li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you have a profile for your ideal salesperson, don&#8217;t keep it a 
secret. Be sure that your entire leadership team has a copy of it! Share it with 
recruiters so they can deliver candidates that match it. Develop interview steps 
that allow you to measure if these candidates meet the profile. Formulate 
interview questions that expose these areas. </p>
<p>I concluded the meeting with a quick comparison of Willie&#8217;s skills and the 
company&#8217;s attributes, which can be seen on the first page. A marriage between 
these two would be disastrous! Although I wasn&#8217;t able to find Willie a new sales 
home, I did succeed in making the CEOs aware of the steps they need to take in 
order to create the best sales team possible for their company.<br>
