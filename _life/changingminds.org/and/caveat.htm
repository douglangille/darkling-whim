<h1>The Caveat</h1>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="#ethical">The ethical debate</a> |
<a href="#academic">The academic debate</a> | <a href="#betrayal">The betrayal 
response</a> | <a href="#so">So what?</a></p>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>
<p>So here we are, with a site stuffed full of things about how to persuade 
people, which, after all, is what 'changing minds' is. It would seem likely that some people may be feeling a little cautious 
about this (or maybe even a little outraged). This page is thus the 'caveat' 
that seeks to address some of these concerns -- at least as far as one can 
without a face-to-face discussion. </p>
<h2><a name="ethical"></a>The ethical debate</h2>
<h3>Is persuasion a loaded gun?</h3>
<p>The question of whether we should tell people how to persuade others is 
something that could well raise some ethical hackles. Put simply, there is an argument that goes something like this:</p>
<p class="quote">If you give someone a gun, they will kill people. Therefore, you should not 
teach people to persuade. </p>
</p>
<p>Although this is 'non sequitur' there is a degree of truth about it. So 
should you not teach persuasion? This depends to some extent on your 
<a href="../explanations/belief/belief_about_people.htm">beliefs about people</a>. If you believe we 
are all simply selfish and will use persuasion to harm others, then you will 
quite naturally consider teaching persuasion to be unethical.</p>
<p>The problem is, we all have guns. Or at least we all have the ability to 
persuade. Some of us are more refined about it and many of us do a good 
imitation of a bull in a china shop. The unskilled person who persuades by 
shouting and other forms of coercion can do far more lasting damage than the 
person who persuades more subtly.</p>
<h3>Is persuasion bad?</h3>
<p>The arguments above all seem to assume that persuasion is a bad thing. They 
assume persuasion is akin to violence. However, there are countless occasions 
where changing another person's mind is a very good thing. In fact good 
persuasion can avoid violence, including psychological violence. Consider a parent 
who persuades their children. Or a policeman who avoids an incident with an 
angry mob. In fact changing minds is at the core of many valuable jobs.</p>
<p>The real difference is <i>intent</i>. Most intent is positive, or at least 
neutral. We believe that when we seek to change the mind of another person, we 
very seldom intend to do them any harm. And in fact if we are unskilled at 
persuasion, we are more likely to harm them than if we are skilled.</p>
<p>Despite some opinions to the contrary, even sales people largely work by 
seeking to enhance the lives of their customers. If we <i>care </i>about the 
other person, then this will guide our hands in persuasion. If we do not care or 
hate them, then persuasion might be used to cause harm. On balance, we believe 
that the balance for the good far outweighs the potential harm, and hence we 
continue the work here.</p>
<p>A second benefit of learning about persuasion is that you also quickly learn 
to identify situations where others are trying to persuade you. It may not be a bad 
thing to be persuaded, but with this knowledge, you can engage in intelligent 
decision-making rather than unthinking reaction.</p>
<p>While I do try to get as much as possible right, there are no guarantees 
about the truth of anything written here in this website. If you want the truth, 
the best place to seek this is in peer-reviewed academic journals, although 
academics still differ in their views and regularly challenge one another about 
methods, data, conclusions and so on. </p>
<p>To some extent the site is a record of my studies, and I have done several 
post-graduate and many industrial qualifications and courses, and continue to 
read both practitioner and academic works. I might even disagree with myself as 
things I wrote years ago I may not agree with now.</p>
<p>In the end, the only truth is your own. If something sounds right, then it 
can be your truth until you hear something better. If you try things out in the 
real world, then those that work for you will also be your truths. Even those 
that do not work you may say are ineffective, although maybe they just did not 
work for you, this time.</p>
<p class="quote"><i>Stick to your values when persuading. You'll feel better for 
it. And know that not everyone has the same values as you.</i></p>
<h3>The nature of humanity</h3>
<p>We are naturally a deceitful species. Evolution has done this for us: if you 
can deceive another person or a prey into certain actions then you may succeed 
and avoid physical harm at the same time. </p>
<p>It has even been suggested that our big brains evolved in a race between the 
ability to deceive and the ability to detect deception. Because we are both. 
Everyone cheats, mostly in small ways, from taking pencils home from the office 
to exceeding the speed limit. And also we are surprisingly good at reading
<a href="../techniques/body/body_language.htm">body language</a> and noticing 
small nuances in how people speak.</p>
<p>Persuasion can be viewed as a game where the persuader tries to get around 
the defending walls of a suspicious listener. Yet true persuasion requires the 
other person to listen and think carefully.</p>
<p>If you can understand your own humanity and that of other people, then you 
will be in a better position to decide how to use persuasive methods, perhaps 
even more ethically, than if you just follow your natural nose.</p>
<h2><a name="academic"></a>The academic debate</h2>
<p>There is a tradition in academia of challenge, and even distinguished 
professors will happily rubbish one another's theories. So what chance this 
site, especially when we seek to build some kind of academic foundation?</p>
<p>Hands up, we are not pretending to cover all the bases and of course we could 
not approach building full Ph.D. rigor into every page. But at least we are making 
an effort -- certainly far, far more than many other sites and writers who make 
broad assertions without any references at all. </p>
<p>The argument goes both ways, and some might say that simple assertions would 
be enough. Although we accept that this is just fine for many people, we prefer 
to seek a different balance point. We do know that you can't make everyone 
happy, and that's ok. In fact if you want to argue about anything here we might 
even feel a sense of satisfaction as you are now thinking further about the 
subject, which of course is what it is largely about.</p>
<p>While I do try to get as much as possible right, there are no guarantees 
about the truth of anything written here in this website. If you want the truth, 
the best place to seek this is in peer-reviewed academic journals, although 
academics still differ in their views and regularly challenge one another about 
methods, data, conclusions and so on. </p>
<p>To some extent the site is a record of my studies, and I have done several 
post-graduate and many industrial qualifications and courses, and continue to 
read both practitioner and academic works. I might even disagree with myself as 
things I wrote years ago I may not agree with now.</p>
<p>In the end, the only truth is your own. If something sounds right, then it 
can be your truth until you hear something better. If you try things out in the 
real world, then those that work for you will also be your truths. Even those 
that do not work you may say are ineffective, although maybe they just did not 
work for you, this time.</p>
<p class="quote"><i>Don't automatically believe anything you read on the web. 
But do consider it and do try stuff to find what works for you.&nbsp; </i></p>
<h2><a name="betrayal"></a>The betrayal response</h2>
<p>It has been said that friends come and go, but enemies accumulate. This can 
be seen in such circumstances as governments, where Machiavellian leaders end up 
being deposed by those they have hurt. Margaret Thatcher did this in the UK in 
the 1980s. She had very clear beliefs about what needed to be done, and arguably 
did the country a lot of good (let's not get into that debate), but in doing 
so she caused betrayal responses in other people who had their own way of 
getting their own back -- such as Sir Geoffrey Howe's elegant and incisive 
'broken cricket bat' speech that was the beginning of the end of her reign (in 
which she used the 'royal we' more than once!).</p>
<p>Those who live by the gun, die by the gun. Many wise sayings  point in the 
same direction. If you seek to harm others, then you will eventually reap what 
you sow. Being skilled at persuasion and using it selfishly is thus likely only to accelerate your 
demise. If people are harmed by your words, even though they may be persuaded at 
the time, they will later reflect and seek justice.</p>
<p>There is also a self-response. We all have multiple internal personalities, 
and if you harm others then your internal conscience will punish you. Many 
despots and murderers lead miserable, self-recriminating lives as their inner 
selves remind them every day of what they have done.</p>
<p>While I do try to get as much as possible right, there are no guarantees 
about the truth of anything written here in this website. If you want the truth, 
the best place to seek this is in peer-reviewed academic journals, although 
academics still differ in their views and regularly challenge one another about 
methods, data, conclusions and so on. </p>
<p>In the end, the only truth is your own. If something sounds right, then it 
can be your truth until you hear something better. If you try things out in the 
real world, then those that work for you will also be your truths. Even those 
that do not work you may say are ineffective, although maybe they just did not 
work for you, this time.</p>
<p class="quote"><i>You reap what you sow. If you hurt others, then at some 
point you will likely be hurt yourself. Beware the betrayed as their just anger 
can lead them to extremes.&nbsp;&nbsp; </i></p>
<h1><a name="so"></a>So what?</h1>
<p>So the bottom line of any persuasion is a kind of 'caveat emptor' (or maybe a 
'caveat persuader'): If you use persuasion selfishly, seeking to harm others or 
even passively allowing them to be harmed, then although you gain now, in the 
end you know you will suffer for your unkindness.</p>
<p>The reverse is also true: with good intent (as we believe most people have), 
increasing your skills at changing the minds of others will bring greater good 
to the world. This site offers knowledge, not skill. To become expert you need 
two more things: guidance and practice. Find people from who you can learn, and 
take opportunities to practice in the field where you are interested, which may 
range from sales to teaching or other mind-changing career.</p>
<p>We also know that those who would persuade unethically will find a way, 
whether this site existed or not. A benefit of this site here is that it can help you see through their games and avoid being duped.</p>
<h3>And...</h3>
<p>And of course please be aware: this is the web. Do not assume the content of 
this website is the definitive source of knowledge on what is written here. It 
is the fruit of wide research, but any page on this website is only as accurate 
as the author could discover at the time of writing. No guarantees are given as 
to veracity of anything. Just goodwill and best understanding.</p>
