<font size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>So what's this site about? You might well guess from the URL. It's about persuasion 
and general changing of minds, 
  in all its forms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changing others' minds 
is at the core of many <a href="../disciplines/disciplines_list.htm">professions and 
disciplines</a>, from <a href="../disciplines/leadership/leadership.htm">leadership</a> to 
<a href="../disciplines/brand_management/brand_management.htm">brand management</a> to psychotherapy to 
<a href="../disciplines/sales/sales.htm">sales</a>. 
And although each has its body of knowledge, they all have much in common.<h2><a name="you"></a>Who are you?</h2>
<p>So who are you, the peruser of this site? you might be a sales person, looking 
  for deeper secrets (and there are plenty here and more to come). You might be 
  a marketer, a teacher or another professional from our domains of knowledge.
You may be a business leader or change agent. You may well work in a job not mentioned here, because every job has at least some 
  element of persuasion.</p>
<p>You may also be a student of persuasion and psychology. This site is based on
much research, and the practical techniques are backed up with all of the main
academic theories and research. If you want to reference pages here, please see 
the <a href="students.htm">notes for students</a> page.</p>
<p>You might also be the victim or target of persuasion, as we all are, many times 
  each and every day. Because if you can detect a trick or technique coming your 
  way, you can avoid it, expose it, or play with the trickster, doubling back 
  the deception and outplaying them at their own game. For this is the great leveller: 
  if you try to deceive someone and they discover it, then the game ends there 
  and then, and they may never trust you again.</p>
<h2> <a name="we"></a>Who are we?</h2>
<p> 
  The author of this site is David Straker, an individual with a long background in a 
  range of mind-changing areas, including (in no particular order) counseling, 
	psychology, marketing, sales, education, business change, international 
	management and consulting. Oh yes, and parenting. And four postgraduate 
	qualifications in changing minds (M.Sc. Psychology, M.Sc. Management and 
	Technology, 
	Postgraduate Certificate in Education, and Diploma in Marketing). </p>
<h3>How do we do it?</h3>
<p>Occasional emails from kind readers wonder about the effort involved in 
writing and maintaining the site. Nobody works full-time on the site, but if you 
include research and writing, then about 20 to 40 hours per week go 
into it, and have done for about ten years. That adds up to between 10,000 and 
20,000 hours. I (Dave) study constantly and have a 
<a href="http://www.librarything.com/catalog/dmstraker">personal library</a> of thousands of books and 
have read goodness how many journal articles. 
(I'm not obsessive -- just passionate ;). And from Autumn 2010, I've given up 
the day job to work full time on the site, with occasional paid work and a lot 
of voluntary stuff (a great way to
<a href="../techniques/happiness/happiness.htm">happiness</a>, by the way).</p>
<h3>What's In It For Us</h3>
<p> Why? you might be asking. Why would someone put all the work into this site 
  to give away their hard-won secrets? What's the 'WIIFM' (What's In It For Me) factor? Good question.</p>
<p> Putting together this site gives several benefits:</p>
<ul>
  <li> I want to get even better at persuasion (and resisting it!). 
    <ul>
      <li>Just writing and organizing stuff helps you learn. And trying to explain 
        it to others helps you even more. Just ask any teacher or writer.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I might even make some money at it.</li>
  <ul>
    <li> The site is ad-supported (see 'funding philosophy' below).</li>
    <li> If enough people like what is here often enough, it might 
    one day support full-time development of the site.</li>
  </ul>
  <li> I've written a 'book of the site'. Maybe I'll sell a fair number.</li>
  <li> It's fun!</li>
  <li>I get a kick out of it. People write me nice emails from around the world, 
  which is kind and helps satisfy my
  <a href="../explanations/needs/identity.htm">identity needs</a> to know I'm making a difference to a lot of other folks.</li>
</ul>
<p>From Autumn 2010, I live on a combination of site-generate revenue, savings 
and occasional consulting. I've made the jump from office work and am now full-time 'changing 
minds'.</p>
<h2><a name="phil"></a>The philosophy</h2>
<h3>Moral philosophy</h3>
<p> The philosophy for the site is to take a neutral moral position. Persuasion 
methods are like weapons: whether they are used for good or bad is the 
responsibility of the user. At changingminds.org, 
  we just tell it like it is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could try to impress my values on you, but I do know full well that would
not be successful. However, I do know that unfriendly persuasion 
  can be harmful to your health, whatever the surgeon-general might say.</p>
<p>Friends come and go, but enemies accumulate, and if you persist in taking
advantage of other people, you are taking your happiness in your own hands. Even the
meekest of people can turn really nasty if they feel they have been tricked or
betrayed. </p>
<p>See more about this in the <a href="caveat.htm">Caveat</a>.</p>
<p><i><font color="#800080">The bottom line: we reap what we sow.&nbsp;</font></i></p>
<h3>Content philosophy</h3>
<p>Any piece of writing can stretch from high academia to unproven one-person's
experience and views. The approach in this site is to cover both academic 
theories and hands-on practitioner material.</p>
<p>As far as possible, we want to be able to show the solid research on which
the practical 'how to' material is based. This also gives the benefit of
material that is useful for both students and practitioners. We can&#39;t be fully 
academic as this would requires pages of references for every claim. But rest 
assured, we do try to be sensible and base writings on understanding rather than 
opinion or hearsay.</p>
<p>All this will of course, take time. So hang in there, keep dropping back and
you'll be amazed at how we grow! (by the way, you won't find any of those
annoying 'under construction' signs around here--it's all a building site,
whether for new projects or improving the existing edifices!).&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><font color="#800080">The bottom line: content is king.</font></i></p>
<h3>Technical philosophy</h3>
<p>Technical-wise, the philosophy is 'quick and easy'. You'll find limited
graphics, which means fast-loading pages. We also aim to cross-link the site,
making good use of the hyperlinking capabilities of the web.</p>
<p>There aren't a lot of graphics: they slow downloads.&nbsp; The site was 
started in the says of modems and phone lines, when light content was helpful. 
The need for this came back with smart phones, when bandwidth is again 
important. We&#39;re working to help you get information quickly!</p>
<p>Color interest is achieved through fonts and backgrounds (although most text
is high-contrast black-on-white).</p>
<p>On the &#39;how wide should the columns be&#39; question, we listened to the 
arguments then decided to let you decide. If you fill the screen, the text will 
follow. If you like narrower columns, then, hey, the web interfaces on window 
resizing are designed to make the text follow you. </p>
<p>This decision was made at the turn of the millennium. As it turns out it has 
proved very useful for mobile devices too. As of 2011, we&#39;ve even changed the 
format to a &#39;responsive&#39; one so even on small phones things should read right.</p>
<p><i><font color="#800080">The bottom line: KISS.</font></i></p>
<h3>Funding philosophy</h3>
<p>The site is funded from simple advertising 
revenues.</p>
<p>The ads have deliberately been kept straightforward and honest, using only 
the high-integrity ad providers. We've avoided nasty flashy banners and&nbsp;adult stuff that serve more to drive people away than attract them.</p>
<p>We've a philosophy of helping others, and believe that putting others 
first is the best way 
to success. If you help enough people, then enough of those people will help 
you.</p>
<p><i><font color="#800080">The bottom line: give to gain.</font></i></p>
<h2><a name="intellectual"></a>Intellectual property</h2>
<p>The words here are copyright but you are free to use them for non-commercial 
purposes and of course you can link to anything here (that's what the internet 
is about!). If you want to use anything for commercial purposes, including use 
with a company intranet, please do <a href="contact.htm">contact us</a> so we can create a 
win-win agreement (we may even be able to add further value for you).</p>
<p>As a content-oriented site, we necessarily refer to what other people have 
done (as do most books),  with the belief that we are not treading on any toes. We do our 
best to acknowledge sources (perhaps more so than some others) and promote 
relevant texts. If we have 
got any of this wrong, please let us know. If you are the owner of any 
copyright, etc. and want anything changed or removed,  please
<a href="contact.htm">contact us</a> and we will be pleased 
to correct things.</p>
<h2><a name="ref"></a>Referencing</h2>
<p>We get many requests regarding referencing pages for essays, papers, etc. 
Here's some key notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you want to reference anything on the site, or link to it, there is no 
need to ask for permission, 
although it is always nice to <a href="contact.htm">hear from you</a>.</li>
  <li>All 
content is written by David Straker (M.Sc. (Psychol), M.Sc. (Mgt &amp; Tech), PGCE., Dip.M., FRSA).</li>
  <li>Please  reference 'changingminds.org' when you are using any material.</li>
  <li>To find when a page was published, just do a 'find' for the page title on 
  the <a href="../changes.htm">Changes</a> page.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are more notes about all this on the <a href="students.htm">students</a>' 
page.</p>
<h2><a name="Disclaimer"></a>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Whilst we have taken as much care as possible to make this site accurate,
with appropriate references and so on, we cannot guarantee that everything is
perfect or complete. Please <a href="contact.htm">contact us</a> if you know 
anything to be incorrect. We also make no claims about site availability or 
development. </p>
<p>Whilst we will constantly do our best to keep the site going, if disaster 
strikes then the site might one day stop being updated or disappear. It's a 
life's work and there should be a few decades before the old dog kicks the 
bucket, so fingers crossed, it should keep going for many years to come.</p>
