<p>I just found your site, and I&#8217;m recommending it to all my undergraduates (in 
fact, you&#8217;re on next month&#8217;s syllabus) for it provides a very needed shotgun 
sample of theories, approaches, lists, etc. for them to consider when 
researching their campaigns. Often, they don not know where to begin to look for 
communication theories that would assist them in their research to solve 
problems with public information campaign situations. -- Professor Karen J-C,

exposition of the most varied and important subjects. Really congratulations for your work, which is helping me to learn a lot and 
improve my personal and professional life.  </p>


<p>&nbsp; -- Nelson V-T</p>


<hr>


<p>I have e-mailed you to congratulate you on such a wonderful site. I am at 
present revising for a Social Psychology exam and your site has been invaluable 
for quick but comprehensive understanding on the terminology which seems to 
dominate the subject, (although very interesting).<br>
I find that sometimes text books have a tendency to make things more difficult 
than necessary, but you have managed to put it in everyday English!!</p>


<p>&nbsp;-- Debbie W, UK</p>


<hr>


<p>Love the site. Its really exciting to have a stripped down fundamental look 
at the psychology of change. I would love to see the forum grow into a 
discussion hub on the techniques and theories described inside the site. <br>
</p>
<p>Thank you for providing these resources to the general public.</p>

will be sharing my source.</p>

<p>I stumbled across your Changing Minds site today and got sidetracked for 
about 2 1/2 hours.........<br>
</p>
<p>An excellent resource and (you'll be pleased to know) it managed to shift my 
thinking too. I had a disappointing client meeting yesterday and your 
information on Groupthink (and other related topics) managed to bring some 
clarity to the situation.<br>
</p>
<p>Great work. Please keep it up.</p>
<p>&nbsp; -- Mark E., UK</p>
<hr>


<p>WOW WOW I think this site provides a lot to be aware of. I am busy now and 
would like to read it all BUT I really don&#8217;t like looking at the comp screen too 
long. I think me along with many others would love to see all this well written 
concise material but into a book with a nice index glossary and put together 
nice, and I&#8217;m sure after reading some free would like to have it as part of 
their collection and to read in book format and would be more than willing to 
pay for it. I think people would love to read a lot of it free but them also 
love to have a hard copy of it on book format with all the fundamental things on 
this site and can read and stay on the site for updates to read online.</p>


<p>-- Brad</p>

<hr>


<p>Just a short note to let you know that I've really enjoyed your site. A 
comprehensive collection of knowledge which should be taught in every public 
school.</p>


<p>-- Paul D</p>

<hr>


<p>&nbsp;What I really liked about your site is you people have provisions made 
for guys like us who are not in a position to afford some products financially. 
This shows that you are real human beings at heart. In future I will definitely 
be useful to you in any form. I don't know how but I am sure I would definitely 
pay back for what I gained from you people.<br>
</p>

<p>Thanks for being how you are and good work being carried by you. </p>

<p>Hello, I stumbled upon your site when trying to do research on the seven 
virtues, but after I got the information I needed (After the typical hit and run 
internet research errand) I discovered what the site was really about, and I 
LOVE it and have been on it reading for a couple of hours now! This is really 
good stuff, the information is a real eye opener, I never knew there were so 
many different factors involved in persuasion and communication that could be 
explained so accurately! </p>


<p>&nbsp;-- Zephos</p>

<hr>


<p>I really think you have done a fabulous thing with your website, giving a lot 
of very useful information that can be used to understand a lot more about what 
you are busy with.</p>

<p>Years ago I managed for McDonald's. Part of their awesome training plan 
included a section they called &quot;McPac&quot; depicting the three ego states. In the 
years I managed people, this has been the single most useful tool to me. It also 
made the basis for my parenting techniques.<br>
</p>
<p>Recently, I tried to explain this whole concept to a friend 'in need'. I 
keyed the basic words into Google and found your site! I'm sure I will read for 
hours now on this fascinating subject. Thank you for your site and all the info 
it includes!<br>

<p>I have just found your fantastic website ChangingMinds.org and having just 
begun studying for a Headteacher's qualification I am finding the site very 
useful. I have particularly enjoyed reading Transformational Leadership and 
relate very much to this.</p>
<p>I will be passing your website address on to my colleagues on the Headteacher 
course.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Best regards,</p>

<p>Preparing for an interview I stumbled across your site after 
completing a Career Anchors questionnaire which I wanted to know more about. 
This is a fantastic site which provides a one stop shop with clear and useful 
information for anyone interested in management practices. I have been on the 
site for over an hour and missed Corrie!!!! [Ed: this is a UK TV soap]</p>
<p>Will be spreading the word - keep up the good work.</p>
<p>-- Palo, UK</p>
