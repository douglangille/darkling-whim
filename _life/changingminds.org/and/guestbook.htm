<p>Lovely site.</p>
<p>Thanks for the site! I'm researching being manipulated by a socialised 
psychopath and his mate, a Machiavellian (both subclinical0. At least, that's 
how I see them. Science lags so far behind reality - the study of psychopathy is 
in its infancy. All the subgroups - Search for '16 faces of a psychopath' - and 
the question of how groups of personality disordered types complement each 
other, none of it's addressed yet. (I think my P and M together make a Dark 
Triad). Anyhow, thanks! </p>
<p>-- Richard</p>

<p>I am devouring your book -- thank you for taking the time to send it over.

<p>I absolutely love your blog and find most of your post's to be just what I'm

related to here. Again, awesome website!</p>

<p>I need to use some of my time to thank you! </p>
<p>I always look for sites and articles for personal growth and what I found 
here was a gold mine. </p>
<p>the site has a number so complex content that I was speechless. In addition 
many of you have interesting contents, all are complete with data that I had 
never seen on other sites. </p>
<p>Good work, honestly.<br>

<hr>
<p>Dear Mr. Straker, </p>
<p>This is just a short message to say to you a big thank you for your wonderful 
Book &quot;Changing Minds in details&quot;.<br>
I am reading it very in details in order to grasp everything from it, and I have 
to say this is by far the best book I have read up to now. Very precise, concise 
but with really mind-changing information. I would recommend it to anyone (but I 
still believe that to recommend a book this person should have the desire to 
read by herself first, otherwise recommending is just useless, they will never 
read it). </p>
<p>I just thought you may like to hear that this book generated a real change 
for me and my coworkers (because I am manager of a team of people), so again, 
Thank you !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

experience of my life (as if that weren't enough!!), but you've also helped me 
understand how the world and how people and how society works, and in my career 
you helped me pinpoint the significance of 'groupthink' and put it into 
perspective... well, you've helped me in a lot of ways. </p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Like the subject line above, I'm really not sure how to 
let you know how much impact you've had on my life, but I realized recently that

<p>Hey David, </p>
<p>My name is Ian, I am a 17 year old student from Australia, and just wanted to 
thank you for the excellent source of information this site provides. </p>
<p>I came across your site while searching for articles on body language and 
dominance, and Changing Minds has helped me to not only understand dominant 
behavior, but also to subvert it. </p>
<p>The more articles I read, the more links I keep clicking on and get 
distracted by - there's just such a wealth of great information available. </p>
<p>- Thank you for putting such effort into this site, Ian. </p>

<hr>
<p>! I found you after reading the book by Scott Adams, &#8220;How to Fail at Almost 
Everything and Still Win Big: Kind of the Story of My Life&#8221;. He references the 
theories you discuss and how important it is to have an understanding of the 
biases that people have. Thank you for providing such a great resource on your 
website, ChangingMinds.org, and through your book to help me better understand 
these concepts. </p>

<p>I came across your webpage the second time recently via Stumbleupon and

<p>This is just a letter to thank you for your comprehensive web site full of 
information about body language. I have not even started to look at the rest, 
but I am very interested. I am busy writing my memoire and already have the 
skeleton of 65 000 words. Now I am searching the internet so find some 
indications of body language to give my story flesh, and wow! Yours is the best, 
I do not have to go further. </p>

put together just for me. how may I ever re-pay your labor, foresight vision and

money. Your funny and I'm excited for you and your family. As you have learned 
when we decide to pursue our heart and do what right rather than do what may 
pay. Although, don't get me wrong keeping things on rent, light, cable email 
coffee and a late night supper and play is also living in balance. I've 
digressed please allow me to say again thank you! For your vision and foresight 
for struggling human consultants and educators. </p>

<p>I'm a mature student of an undergraduate program of Social Studies (Honors-Level

understanding of conformity &amp; compliance on the influence of groups. </p>
<p>I would like to say first of all, a big thank you for providing free access 
to such a great material that you have on your site. Second, you're an 
inspirational person, thank you so much as you have taught me more than I wished 
for, but not less than I need! </p>

<p>Such a wonderful, interesting website. I'm fascinated with persuasion. So 
this website is right up my alley. </p>
<p>I stumbled across it when I searched for Socratic questions on Google (you 
have a great webpage on that). As I started to browse, I found so much I wanted 
to read, understand and apply right away. Really exciting for me. </p>
<p>I know it was a lot of work putting a site like this together. And I know I'm 
not the first and I won't be the last but I'm expressing my deep appreciation 
for you and your teams hard work. </p>
<p>Time for me to do my part and start learning. <br>

<p>Stumbled on your great website trying to understand Myers Briggs types. Read 
your blog and coincidentally saw something today that really was profound in a 
comical way. A bumper sticker on an old car in front of me that said &quot;DON'T 
PANIC. There is always Welfare.&quot; THere is so much unease in the world, and I 
think that bumper sticker said - what is the worse that can happen - you lose 
everything? That's not so bad, even then, there is help even then. Just seemed 
kinda of brilliant to me. have a good Friday.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm based in Melbourne Australia and teach a course for young people with a 
disability about joining the workforce.</p>
<p>I will be including your material in my student workbook as it is so 
perfectly suited to the units I deliver. It came as a surprise that you had no 
copyright issues and for this there are approx 18 young people and myself who 
are very grateful indeed.</p>
<p>Warm wishes for a safe and happy Christmas and New Year.</p>

<p>Hi,<br>
My name is Kathryn and I'm currently doing a degree, having found particularly 
useful information on your website I began to hunt how to reference you 
accurately and I was amazed at the entire section you have to help us poor 
students out!!<br>
Just want to say it's such a good feature and I wish every website had it!<br>
Thank you; an incredibly grateful student. <br>

<p>Thank you, for this practical, clear and very well understood and explained 
content in your website. </p>
<p>In my opinion, not only the content but also the organization of the content 
is major breakthrough. </p>
<p>As an engineer who was not educated on these matters, it was a great benefit 
for me reading from your website. </p>
<p>Thank you again. </p>
<p>-- Gediz G</p>
<hr>
<p>I would just like to thank you for the analysis of the Barack Obama 
acceptance speech on your website. </p>
<p>On Friday afternoon I taught a group of adults who are giving education a 
second shot and who hope to go on to train to be teachers on completing their 
Access to Higher Education course. </p>
<p>As a class we watched the speech in full and then went through your detailed 
analysis of the speech line by line - it was an amazing session. We had been 
studying the use of persuasion over the last four sessions, looking at 
increasingly complex structures and formats in preparation for the students' 
first written assignment. In the majority of cases this is the first piece of 
academic writing students will attempt in a good many years. </p>
<p>What the students lack in confidence and technqiue they more than make up for 
in experience, life skills and passion and they got it - they really got it. 
Allegory, rhetoric, personification, alliteration - terms which caused 
widespread panic just a few weeks ago were acknowledged, understood and 
discussed with considerable knowledge and insight. This was where their implicit 
knowledge of language became explicit and where their self belief and confidence 
came on in leaps and bounds. </p>
<p>This is a first class resource - with thanks from us all. <br>
</p>
<p>-- Anne M, USA</p>
