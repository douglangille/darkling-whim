<h2><a name="des"></a>Description</h2>
<p>Well-being has long been of interest to philosophers, but only recently has 
fallen into psychologists' sphere of interest.</p>
<p>'Subjective Well-Being', sometimes abbreviated as 'SWB' is a commonly-used 
measure of what many think of as happiness, although in psychology SWB has a 
somewhat broader definition (although papers on the subject sometimes use the 
terms interchangeably).</p>
<p>'Subjective' means that it is what people feel and report. You cannot yet 
stick probes into the brain to measure happiness. All we can do is listen to 
what people say. As with any subjective assessment, this is only a perception, 
but it nevertheless has received a lot of attention and has proven useful.</p>
<p>'Well-being' seems something of a medical interpretation for what we usually 
call 'happiness'. For psychologists, however it is a wider subject.</p>
<p>SWB includes both cognitive and emotional aspects. Cognitions about 
well-being cover overall satisfaction with life and specific external factors. Emotionally, happiness 
is an internal feeling and has a more hedonic content.</p>
<p>SWB is not just about the positives. Absence of negative situations and 
emotions are also important for well-being. Feeling angry or fearful can hence 
reduce SWB, as can dwelling on the problems of life.</p>
<p>In his definitive article, Ed Diener (1984) defines three ways we look at 
well-being:</p>
<ul>
	<li>LS: Life satisfaction</li>
	<li>PA: Positive affect</li>
	<li>NA: Negative affect</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as life satisfaction, which is a general measure, Diener later added 
domain satisfaction (DS), where you can be satisfied with some parts of your 
life but not others (Diener, Suh, Lucas, and Smith, 1999). There is some debate 
as to whether LS causes DS or the other way around, or they are both caused by 
common factors such as personality.</p>
<h2><a name="mea"></a>Measurement</h2>
<p>There is a range of instruments that can be used to measure well-being, 
although negative/positive affect and cognition are typically measured 
separately, for example with Bradburn&#8217;s Affect-Balance Scale and Diener's 
Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS).</p>
<p>Measures of SWB vary with the instrument being used. Here is a composite list 
of factors, with perceptions that people:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Find meaning and purpose in life</li>
	<li>Have sufficient supportive friends and family</li>
	<li>Support others, sustaining their social capital</li>
	<li>Have interesting and challenging work</li>
	<li>Feel competent and able to handle life</li>
	<li>Are easily amused and smile or laugh often</li>
	<li>Are good, living by their values</li>
	<li>Get what they think they deserve</li>
	<li>Have a positive self-image</li>
	<li>Feel able to cope with life's emergencies</li>
	<li>Feel a sense of belonging</li>
	<li>Have fewer and less intense negative emotions</li>
	<li>Are optimistic, using much positive language</li>
	<li>Have basic needs sufficiently satisfied</li>
	<li>Expect a long, healthy life</li>
	<li>Do not expect traumatic experiences</li>
</ol>
<p>Instruments can vary from a few broad questions about happiness or life, to 
longer lists of more specific items. As with any test, the holy grail is to ask the fewest 
questions that will still give a 
<a href="../../disciplines/hr/selection/reliability.htm">reliable</a> and 
<a href="../../disciplines/hr/selection/validity.htm">valid</a> result.</p>
<h2><a name="obj"></a>Objective measures</h2>
<p>General well-being measures may independently consider contextual factors 
which affect all people. This is 'objective well-being' as it is not subjective 
and seeks independent measures rather than asking people what they think and 
feel. 
</p>
<p>The notion of 'gross national happiness' considers influential factors such as 
economics, environment, health, institutions, politics and demographics. This 
can be a useful way for governments to assess overall satisfaction of their 
populace.</p>
<p>Although age is a factor, older people are not unhappy as some may think. In fact there is a U-shaped 
happiness curve through life, with the lowest ebb often in the 40s (Oswald 
1997). </p>
<p>Money has a non-linear relationship with happiness. In what is sometimes 
called the 'Easterlin Paradox', happiness increases with income only for a 
while, after which it flattens off (Easterlin, 1974). It can also decrease with 
increasing wealth, perhaps as people fear losing it (it hence may also have a 
U-shaped profile, albeit inverted).</p>
<p>Religion can be a factor in SWB to the extent that it contributes towards 
meaning, confidence and other well-being factors. Other aspects of life can 
likewise help in this way, such as having a satisfactory marriage, successful 
children, meaningful work and so on.</p>
<p>The general success of a country, as typically measured by Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP) has some effect on happiness but not as much as might be expected. 
Factors such as health, life-expectancy and a good family life are correlated 
with well-being. </p>
<p>GDP also correlates with factors such as obesity, which does not necessarily 
lead to happiness. Curiously, suicide tends to be higher in affluent societies, 
perhaps because of higher expectations and subsequent disappointment.</p>
<p>Two factors that have a negative effect on well-being that can be easily 
measured are unemployment and inflation. These have been combined in a 'misery 
index' (Di Tella, MacCulloch and Oswald 2001). Ill health and the death of a 
loved one can also have lasting effects. These both involve significant loss, 
other forms of which can have a strong depressive effect. Loss is a deep 
subject and is a consequence of
<a href="../../explanations/theories/attachment.htm">attachment</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="dis"></a>Discussion</h2>
<p>SWB is in our genes. In twin studies, Tellegen et al. (1988) shows that 40% 
of the variance in positive emotion and 55% of the variance in negative 
emotional is genetic.</p>
<p>Personality has some effect on SWB, particularly the Big Five 'openness' to 
experience. Neuroticism has a reversed effect, as the more anxious people are, 
the less satisfied they are.</p>
<p>An important driver of SWB is the way we compare ourselves against others. If 
everyone else has more money, then I will feel poor, envious and less happy. If 
I am far richer than my peers then that differential will damage friendly 
relations with them. Inequality hence tends to reduce happiness (Di Tella, 
MacCulloch and Oswald 2001).</p>
