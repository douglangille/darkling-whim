<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The process of radicalization, including social, ideological and purpose 
conversion, is something that is of great concern in times when radicals take 
extreme action. Here are some notes on how a person may become radicalized. They 
may be remembered by the acronym 'TORA'.</p>
<h2><a name="tra"></a>Transgression</h2>
<p>The process of radicalization often starts with with some form of transgression by 
the other side, breaking rules that the person's side holds as very important. </p>
<h3>Mistreatment</h3>
<p>A common transgressing action is mistreatment, typically by the 
authorities or military personnel using methods that cause extreme physical pain 
or mental distress. The mistreatment may be of the person who hence becomes radicalized, but often it is other people who are lionized as heroes or martyrs. </p>
<p>For example, extreme methods of <a href="../interrogation/interrogation.htm">
interrogation</a> of suspects in Northern Ireland in the 1970s led to them 
becoming radicalized and their story leading to many others taking a strong 
position. More recently Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay are clear candidates.</p>
<p>Mistreatment can be historical and reasons for radicalization can go back 
generations. Past wars, massacres, persecutions and so on can fester for 
hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Mistreatments today such as rape and child abuse are also extreme 
transgressions that effectively radicalize those who would severely punish the 
perpetrators. Many of us who think we would never be radicalized still hold 
extreme views on such topics.</p>
<h3>Immorality</h3>
<p>If there is no direct mistreatment then the inherent badness of the other 
side may be inferred from their transgression of an inviolable law or
<a href="../../explanations/values/values.htm">value</a>.</p>
<p>They may say things or take actions which are shocking and unthinkable, 
thereby proving their unworthiness. They may have betrayed a trust, defiled a 
holy object, conducted black rituals, blasphemed or otherwise shown a terrible 
lack of respect for people or social rules. </p>
<p>Religion has been a source of 
radicalized conflict for many centuries.</p>
<h2><a name="org"></a>Organization</h2>
<p>A radical needs a movement, a cause. At some point, the outrage at the 
transgression is converted into organization for consequent action.</p>
<h3>Outrage</h3>
<p>A critical response to transgression is that some people at least are 
<a href="../../explanations/emotions/outrage.htm">outraged</a> or feel such a strong sense of
<a href="../../explanations/trust/effects_of_betrayal.htm">betrayal</a> to the 
extent that they seek <a href="../../explanations/trust/four_justice.htm">
justice</a>, typically the extreme vengeance of retributive justice that lies 
outside national laws. This may be because the laws are seen as inadequate or 
because they represent governments who are the target of the outrage.</p>
<h3>Core</h3>
<p>At some point, a core organization is set up to drive the ideals and 
action. This typically happens in two ways. One is where an individual leader 
starts alone. Secondly, the core may arise more spontaneously as concerned individuals find one 
another. </p>
<p>People in the core (often a single leader) may write or use a critical text 
or otherwise use charismatic oration to establish the central message.</p>
<p>Cores can also be diffused, for example where they are based on central texts 
which are interpreted and acted upon in localized core organizations. </p>
<h3>Focus</h3>
<p>After initial development of the core message and core group, the 
organization starts to develop. This may be done formally or remain relatively informal. Key 
parts of this are in promoting the message, recruiting new people and driving action.</p>
<p>This focus leads to a need for more people to spread the message and take 
action. The purpose of the core is then to sustain the focus and drive the rest 
of the organization.</p>
<p>The organization may be strictly hierarchical, but it may also be very 
diffuse, with independent cells adopting the ideals and acting on their own.</p>
<h3>Evolution</h3>
<p>While the organization may start with a relatively peaceful principle, at 
some point it evolves or divides such that the viewpoint intensifies to the 
point of concluding that talk is not enough and action is needed. At first this 
may involve activist activities such as public rallies. Eventually, it can 
easily spill over into the view that violence is needed.</p>
<p>When organizations divide, they may oppose one another and can self-destruct, 
which is one reason why a number of extreme groups never have much real effect. 
They may also become symbiotic, for example where the non-violent arm does not 
directly oppose the violent arm, and can in effect act as a step on the way 
towards the radically violent group.</p>
<h2><a name="the"></a>Recruitment</h2>
<p>When the transgression leads to some people seeking revenge then they may 
seek to organize in some way, recruiting and <a href="conversion.htm">converting</a> 
others to the cause. </p>
<h3>Rallying</h3>
<p>The call to arms goes through many channels, typically targeting groups where 
members may already feel the sense of injustice, such as minority religions, the 
unemployed, low-status people and so on. Other <a href="vulnerable_persona.htm">vulnerable</a> 
people may well also be targeted. Peaceful groups with similar basic beliefs are 
often a key source of recruits.</p>
<p>Communication may include preaching, emails posters, one-to-one calls and so 
on. While these do not radicalize alone, they often take the first step in 
communicating urgency or outrage. Later, the volume and intensity of messages 
create enough <a href="../../principles/tension.htm">tension</a> to trigger 
action.</p>
<p>Initial communication may be subtle and seemingly about other subjects. 
Religions can be like this, first creating a desirable place, selling friendship 
and salvation before radical action.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, the subject of discussion turns to the basic transgression, including the 
mistreatment or immorality and the consequent sense of outrage. This creates 
anger and a desire for action.</p>
<h3>Polarization</h3>
<p>A key part of the message is to demonize the other side,
dehumanizing and
<a href="../../explanations/theories/objectification.htm">objectifying</a> the 
'enemy' as less than human. In this way,
<a href="../../explanations/values/values.htm">values</a> about not harming 
others can be bypassed as they become 'things' that can be safely harmed or 
killed without any guilt about breaking social or personal rules. </p>
<p>In this,
<a href="../../explanations/theories/polarization.htm">polarization</a> 
typically uses forms of <a href="../../principles/amplification.htm">
amplification</a>, negative
<a href="../../explanations/theories/stereotypes.htm">stereotypes</a> and 
simplified
<a href="../../explanations/theories/schema.htm">schema</a>. By showing 
that the other side is so extreme and unreasonable, the simple conclusion is reached that 
the proposed response of extreme action is the only possible route forward. The
<a href="../../disciplines/argument/argument.htm">arguments</a> used may well be 
full of <a href="../../disciplines/argument/fallacies/fallacies.htm">fallacies</a> 
but the passion and underlying messages are clear.</p>
<p>Polarization also creates excitement, converting what could be seen as 
mundane to something more <a href="../../explanations/needs/arousal.htm">
arousing</a> and thrilling. </p>
<h3>Socialization</h3>
<p>A critical part of radicalization is often in the way the message is 
socialized, becoming a central part of everyday conversation outside of the 
rallying call.</p>
<p>Extreme groups often work in local 'cells' that encourage a
<a href="../../disciplines/sociology/articles/them_us.htm">them and us</a> 
perception. These are relatively autonomous 
while sharing the broad polarized message of outrage an extreme action. One 
reason for this structure is so members related closely with one another as much 
as the overall cause. Like regular soldiers, their close personal connection 
with one another keeps them focused and committed.</p>
<p>For socialization to work best, this conversation should be contained, with any 
contrary messages being kept at bay. Where possible, the people will be
<a href="isolation.htm">isolated</a> to insulate them from external dissuasion. 
Where this is not possible,
<a href="../../explanations/theories/inoculation.htm">inoculation</a> may be 
used to help them ward off other views.</p>
<p><a href="../../explanations/theories/groupthink.htm">Groupthink</a>,
<a href="../../explanations/theories/risky_shift.htm">risky shift</a> and other 
social means of ensuring <a href="../../explanations/theories/a_conforming.htm">
conformance</a> and normalizing extreme measures may also be used to keep people on track. </p>
<p>Socialization also helps give <a href="../../explanations/needs/meaning.htm">
meaning</a> to what may otherwise be a dull life, to the point where people will 
become ready to sacrifice themselves for the greater good.</p>
<h3>Normalization</h3>
<p>The actions that may required are normalized, for example by repeat showing 
of videos of extreme violence, talking about examples of actual events and 
getting the target person to approve of and commit increasingly radical acts.</p>
<p>Any doubt is jumped on quickly, with the person made to feel guilty or 
threatened with punishment or ostracization. Aggression may be used to frighten 
them into conformance. Softer methods may also be used but which subtly coerce 
their thinking.</p>
<h2><a name="act"></a>Action</h2>
<p>At some point, the need for action is raised and the radicalized person moved 
towards proving their passion. </p>
<h3>Requirement</h3>
<p>The need to act and the required action may appear through the direction of a 
group <a href="../../disciplines/leadership/leadership.htm">leader</a>, though it may also emerge via less structured groups talking about what 
they might do. Action can range from protest to acts of terrorism and may start 
small and escalate either with success or frustration at limited success. </p>
<p>A way that commitment is built is with
<a href="../general/sequential/sequential.htm">sequential requests</a>, such as
<a href="../general/sequential/fitd.htm">Foot In The Door (FITD)</a>, where 
small initial requests that are easy to comply with are later followed up with 
larger requests. </p>
<p>When there is a religious background then scriptures that can be interpreted 
as requiring or permitting violent action will act as a mandate or at least not 
inhibit extreme responses to what may be seen as heretical action.</p>
<h3>Promise</h3>
<p>Fulfilling the requirement is often linked to a promise of glory, from the 
admiration of peers to a guaranteed place in heaven.</p>
<p>People who have already taken such action are held up as heroes. They and 
their actions are glorified and the radicalized people made to feel almost in 
that state of being deeply admired by many. All that is needed is heroic action.</p>
<p>This in particular works with with people who are seeking 
<a href="../../explanations/meaning/meaning.htm">meaning</a> in life and 
who are feeling ignored and irrelevant. 'At last I can make a difference' is a 
common thought.</p>
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<p>Preparation for action is also a part of the radicalization process, as it 
sets the person on a road that is easy to start and increasingly difficult to 
back out of. This is particularly true when the person is working with others 
towards joint action. This may involve simulation, practice and continued 
indoctrination.</p>
