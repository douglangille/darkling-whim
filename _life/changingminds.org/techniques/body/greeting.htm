<p>There are many possible components of greeting as the styles vary 
significantly across social groups and cultures.</p>
<p>Greeting is a ritual that helps break the ice and paves the way for 
appropriate other interaction. Greetings can include signals that may even be 
secret, for example saying 'we're in the same club'. </p>
<p>Formality is often an important factor, and when you move from a formal 
greeting to an informal greeting is an important factor in development of a 
friendship. Too early and it is an insult. Too late and it you may be considered 
arrogant or distant. </p>
<h2><a name="han"></a>Handshake</h2>
<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>Handshake variables include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Strength (weak - strong)</li>
  <li>Temperature (cold - hot)</li>
  <li>Moisture (damp - dry)</li>
  <li>Fullness of grip (full - partial)</li>
  <li>Duration (brief - long)</li>
  <li>Speed (slow - fast)</li>
  <li>Complexity (shake - dance)</li>
  <li>Texture (rough - smooth)</li>
  <li>Eye contact (prolonged - intermittent - none)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Styles</h3>
<p>A firm grip shows confidence, whilst a limp grip may indicate timidity, 
particularly in men (women may be expected to be more gentile). A firm grip by 
men also indicates they are more sensation-seeking.</p>
<p>Palm down indicates dominance and a feeling of superiority ('I am on top'). 
Palm sideways indicate equality. Palm up indicates submission.</p>
<p>A long handshake can indicate pleasure and can signal dominance, particularly 
if one person tries to pull away and the dominant person does not let them.</p>
<p>Dominance may also be shown by using the other hand to grip the person, such 
as at the wrist, elbow, arm or shoulder. This may also be done by gripping the shaken hand with both of your hands. 
This may also indicate affection or pleasure (which allows for an ambiguous 
signal).</p>
<p>A variant of the dominant handshake which is used by politicians who are 
being photographed and hence shake hands side-by-side is to stand on the left 
hand side of the other person. This means your hand will be on the outside and 
it will look like you are the dominant party to those viewing the photograph.</p>
<p>Responses to the dominant handshake can include counter-touching (use your 
other hand to hold their hand, wrist, elbow, arm or shoulder), hugging (pull 
them in), thrusting (push them away by pushing your hand towards them) and 
stepping the side.</p>
<p>Hand-touching is also used, for example the 'high five', where open palms are 
touched high in the air, or where closed fists are tapped. Where the other 
person is not gripped, the origins may be in potentially aggressive situations 
where holding of another could be construed as a threatening act.</p>
<h2><a name="sal"></a>Salute</h2>
<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>Salute variables include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Shape of hand (straight - curved)</li>
  <li>Speed (fast - slower)</li>
  <li>Head-touch (forehead - none)</li>
  <li>Shape (up-down - curved)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Style</h3>
<p>The salute is a formal greeting where the open hand is brought up to the 
forehead. It is often used in the military in a strictly 
prescribed manner and situation. </p>
<p>There are several possible origins of this, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Shading the eyes from the brilliance of a superior person.</li>
  <li>An abbreviation of raising one's hat or tugging the forelock (in the 
  absence of a hat).</li>
  <li>Raising helmet visor to show the face (to allow recognition and dispel 
  fears of enmity).</li>
  <li>Raising the hand to show it does not contain a weapon.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="bow"></a>Bowing</h2>
<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>Bowing variables include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lowering (slight - very low)</li>
  <li>Pivot (head - waist)</li>
  <li>Duration (short - long)</li>
  <li>Gender style (bow - curtsey)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Style</h3>
<p>Bowing is another formal greeting and can be as extreme as a full 90 degree 
bend from the waist to even complete prostration on the floor. This averts the 
eyes ('I dare not look at your majesty') and exposes the head ('You can kill me 
if you wish'). </p>
<p>Bowing amongst peers is commonly used in a severely contracted form as a 
slight nod of the head. Even in the shortened form, the lower and longer the 
bow, the greater the respect that is demonstrated.</p>
<p>If eye contact is maintained during a bow, it can signify either mistrust or 
liking. Looking down as you bow indicates submission, although this also can 
just be a formal action.</p>
<p>The female variant on the bow is the curtsey, which again can be a full 
sinking to the floor or a slight bob. Similarly to bowing, this puts the person 
lower than the other person and into a position of greater vulnerability.</p>
<p>Bowing is different in different cultures. In countries such as Japan it is 
clearly defined and an important part of greetings. In other countries it is 
less important or maybe seen as obsequious. </p>
<h2><a name="wav"></a>Waving</h2>
<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>Variables for waving include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open palm (flat - curved)</li>
  <li>Movement angle (big - small)</li>
  <li>Raised (above head - held low)</li>
  <li>Direction (sideways rotation - up-down)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Style</h3>
<p>Waving can be done from a distance. This allows for greeting when you first 
spot another person. It also allows for</p>
<p>Waves gain attention and a big, overhead wave can attract a person from some 
distance. This also makes others look at you and is not likely from a timid 
person.</p>
<p>A stationary palm, held up and facing out is far less obvious and may be 
flashed for a short period, particularly if the other person is looking at you 
(all you need is that they see the greeting).</p>
<p>Greeting children is often done with a small up-and-down movement of fingers, 
holding the rest of the palm still. Between adults, this can be a timid or safe 
signal from a child position ('I won't harm you - please don't harm me.').</p>
<h2><a name="hug"></a>Hugging</h2>
<h3>Variables</h3>
<p><a href="hugging.htm">Hugging</a> variables include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hand placement (shoulder, etc.)</li>
  <li>Arms touch (none - wrap)</li>
  <li>Body position (front - side - behind)</li>
  <li>Pressure (light - strong)</li>
  <li>Body touching (none - full)</li>
  <li>Gender (man/woman - man/woman)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Styles</h3>
<p>Hugging is a closer and more affectionate form of greeting than shaking hands 
and perhaps reflects a desire for <a href="../../principles/bonding.htm">bonding</a>.</p>
<p>Hugging is generally more common between friends, although its usage does 
vary across cultures and is common in some places. Gender rules may also apply, 
for example hugging in America is far more common between women than between 
men. Harassment laws may also limit touching of the other person in what may be 
interpreted as an intimate way.</p>
<p>Full-body hugs create contact with breasts and between genitalia and hence 
may be sexually suggestive or stimulating. This tends to limit their use to 
romantic greetings, although they are still used in some cultures, including 
between men.</p>
<p>Light shoulder-only hugs are more common as social greetings, in which people 
lean forward in order not to break rules about touching breasts or genitalia.</p>
<p>Side-on, one-handed hugs are safer and can be a friendly touch. Even so, this 
still can be a deliberate romantic advance or act of domination (even if not, it 
may be perceived as such).</p>
<p>Longer, fuller hugs often signal greater affection and may happen between 
people who have not seen one another for some time.</p>
<p>Hugging someone from behind can be surprising and even threatening, and is 
usually only done by friends who trust one another implicitly.</p>
<h2><a name="kis"></a>Kissing</h2>
<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>Contact during kissing can be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lip/cheek to lip/cheek</li>
  <li>Duration (peck - smooch)</li>
  <li>Tongue (involved - not)</li>
  <li>Gender (man/woman to man/woman)</li>
  <li>Body involvement (none - full)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Styles</h3>
<p>In some cultures, kissing is a part of social greeting. This may or may not 
include man-man and man-woman (which can lead to significant cross-cultural 
embarrassment).</p>
<p>The type of kiss is governed strongly by the relationship. Social greetings 
are relatively short, and may involve double or triple kissing, alternating 
either side of the face. </p>
<p>General friendship kissing may be longer and with more body contact, though 
mostly using arms to include a hug (and steady the body).</p>
<p>The most intense kiss is the romantic kiss which may well include full-length 
body touching, caressing with hands and lip-to-lip kisses that may even include 
interplay of tongues.</p>
<h2><a name="fac"></a>Facial signals</h2>
<p>The <a href="parts_body_language/face_body_language.htm">face</a> is used a 
great deal in sending greeting signals, and accompanies other greeting activity 
for example saying:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="smile.htm">Smiling</a>: I am pleased to see you.</li>
  <li>Frowning: I am angry with you.</li>
  <li>Raised eyebrows: I am surprised to see you.</li>
  <li><a href="parts_body_language/eyebrows_body_language.htm">Eyebrows</a> together: I do not know your name.</li>
  <li>Looking down: I am inferior to you.</li>
  <li>Expressionless: I do not care about you.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="parts_body_language/eyes_body_language.htm">Eye</a> contact is particularly important in greeting and is usually held for a 
socially prescribed period. Prolonged eye contact can indicate both affection 
and dominance. Little or no eye contact can indicate timidity ('I dare not look 
at you'), dislike ('I do not want to see you') or dominance ('You are 
unimportant and below my interest.'). As with the handshake, a dominant signal 
may be sent under cover of the 'friendly' greeting.</p>
<h2><a name="wor"></a>Words</h2>
<p>The words used in greetings can change significantly with the culture and 
context.</p>
<h3>Formality</h3>
<p>Informal greetings often use non-words and short forms like 'Hi', 'Watcha', 'Yay' 
and so on. Formal meetings use more formal language, such as 'Hello', 
'Greetings', 'Good day' and so on. In some cultures, greeting is very formal and 
a fixed set of words are required in specific situations, 'Greeting, O holy one, 
father of us all and master of the world'.</p>
<h2><a name="oth"></a>Other greetings</h2>
<p>There are many other ways in which people greet and further subtleties around 
the actions above, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Touching or raising a hat</li>
  <li>Pressing or rubbing noses</li>
  <li>Touching or pressing bodies together in certain places and ways</li>
  <li>Moving the body through a defined locus</li>
  <li>Giving of gifts</li>
  <li>Touching palms or fists</li>
</ul>
<p>Greetings may also be extended to parting, for which there are many similar 
rituals, including handshakes, bows and words of praise.</p>
