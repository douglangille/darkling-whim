<h1>Confident Body Language</h1>

<p class="smaller" align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="../techniques.htm">Techniques</a>
&gt; <a href="body_language.htm">Using Body Language</a> &gt; Confident Body Language</p>

<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="#sti">Still</a> | <a href="#unh">
Unhurried</a> | <a href="#unc">Uncovered</a> | <a href="#dir">Direct</a>&nbsp; |
<a href="#and">And</a> | <a href="#See">See also</a></p>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p>How do some people appear <a href="../../principles/confidence.htm">confident</a>, 
while others seem unsure or anxious in some ways? If you can get others to think 
you are confident, then they may well
<a href="../../explanations/trust/trust.htm">trust</a> and
<a href="../../explanations/belief/belief.htm">believe</a> you more easily. In 
contrast, if you appear uncertain, how can they accept what you say as being 
true?</p>
<h2><a name="sti"></a>Still</h2>
<p>Anxious people are tense, and it shows. Their bodies are always moving, 
typically in jerky movements that betray their muscular tension.</p>
<h3>Standing</h3>
<p>When an anxious person is standing, they typically get 'happy feet', stepping 
around the place. A confident person is comfortable standing in one place, 
without even tapping their feet. </p>
<p>Balance your weight evenly, with feet planted a hip-width apart. When weight 
is on one leg, it indicates readiness to move. When you are balanced, you are 
firmly planted, indicating intent to stay and having no fear of attack.</p>
<h3>Sitting</h3>
<p>When sitting, place yourself comfortably, leaning back in the seat rather 
than anxiously forward. You may put your hands on your lap or behind your head 
when relaxing, or steeple them when making evaluative decisions.</p>
<p>Keep the lower body still, with both feet planted on the ground or loosely 
crossed for comfort. Entwined or twitching legs are signs of anxiety.</p>
<h3>Head</h3>
<p>One of the simplest ways to show confidence is to hold your head still. 
Anxious people are always looking for threats. Fix on a point in front of you to 
help you keep your head in one place.</p>
<p>Keep your head upright and with your chin level, as if you were suspended 
from a point at the crown of your head. Anxious people tend to hold the chin 
low, originally in order to protect the vulnerable neck from attack.</p>
<h3>Arms</h3>
<p>We often wave our arms about when talking or clasp them together when 
concerned. While you can make smaller movements, generally you can allow them to 
be still, resting in your lap or hanging at your side. A common confident pose 
with hands is held lightly in front or behind the back (this is typical of 
royalty and presidents). Holding one's own hands can be seen as a sign of 
anxiety so do be careful with this.</p>
<p>Fidgeting is a sign of anxiety. Confident people can keep their hands still 
without the need to move or hide them. Showing one's hands is a way of building 
confidence as it indicates you are not twitchy, have no weapons nor are balling 
fists. For this reason it is a good idea to keep your hands out of any pockets, 
although thumbs lightly in pockets can indicate a casual confidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="unh"></a>Unhurried</h2>
<p>A common effect of anxiety is that people speed up, speaking faster and 
moving their body quickly. A confident person does not need to act quickly and 
shows this by acting at a measured and steady pace.</p>
<h3>Speed</h3>
<p>When you move, do so steadily. This does not mean going at an unnaturally 
slow rate, although it might seem this way. This may feel so strange, it can be 
useful to get feedback from someone else as to what seems natural and relaxed.</p>
<p>Also reduce the speed of your speech. We think much faster than we talk and 
it is easy to end up speaking so fast others cannot understand us. They may also 
assume our fast talk is related more to anxiety than thinking speed.</p>
<p>In movement, take good-sized strides, rather than timid or hurried steps. </p>
<h3>Pauses</h3>
<p>As well as generally going slower, add pauses, both in your speech and your 
movement. For example when you are getting up, move to edge of the seat, pause, 
then get up. Likewise when walking, point the way you are going, then step.</p>
<p>Pausing sends a signal to other people, letting them process what you are 
about to do and so reduces the chance of them being surprised or worried. This 
is just one way that confident people inspire confidence in others.</p>
<h3>Silence</h3>
<p>Even a period of silence or inaction can be comfortable for a confident 
person. Silence is unsettling for many and it can hence be a useful persuasive 
device that also enhances your image of quiet confidence.</p>
<h2><a name="unc"></a>Uncovered</h2>
<p>When we are feeling anxious, we tend to cover ourselves with our hands and 
bodies, protecting vulnerable areas from attack. Confident people do not feel 
the need to defend, and show this with a clear openness.</p>
<h3>Open</h3>
<p>When people are feeling <a href="defensive_body.htm">defensive</a>, they use
<a href="closed_body.htm">closed</a> body language. When they are feeling 
confident, they use <a href="open_body.htm">open</a> body language, exposing 
vulnerable parts of the body and staying relaxed.</p>
<h3>Expressive</h3>
<p>Confident people feel able to express emotions, including with movement of 
their bodies. They tend not to over-do emotion as people who are too expressive 
really be seeking sympathy or trying to coerce others. Confident people do not 
need to do this. They also smile more, including with their eyes.</p>
<h3>Natural</h3>
<p>Above all else, a confident person appears natural. They do not look like 
they are managing their body, nor that they need to do so. For this reason, 
confident body language is often evidence of real confidence as opposed to it 
all being an act.</p>
<h2><a name="dir"></a>Direct</h2>
<p>Anxious people hedge their bets, already being ready to escape. If you are 
confident, you can be direct, without sending a signal that you are 
uncomfortable and ready to leave at a moment's notice. Instead, you can 
confidently engage with the other person, showing you feel safe.</p>
<h3>Greeting</h3>
<p>Greet people <a href="../assertiveness/assertiveness.htm">assertively</a>, 
looking them in the eyes and smiling. Keep your body relaxed. When you shake 
hands, do so with a firm grip (but not one that is aggressively strong).</p>
<h3>Facing</h3>
<p>When engaging with another person, you may face them directly, perhaps 
leaning in. Do not do this in a <a href="dominant_body.htm">dominant</a> way, 
getting too close too soon. Dominant people often have insecurities and use 
aggression to cover up a lack of confidence. </p>
<p>Confident people look at others. They do not need to scan their environment 
in search of threats. They hold people with their gaze, which is relaxed and 
without either narrowing nor opening wide the eyes.</p>
<h3>Listening</h3>
<p>Anxious or dominant people often feel the need to speak. Confident people do 
not need their beliefs verified nor their egos stroked, and so are comfortable 
just <a href="../listening/listening.htm">listening</a>, which is of course a 
great way to get closer to other people.</p>
<h3>Gesture</h3>
<p>A confident person makes limited, firm and smooth gestures, typically to
<a href="../../principles/amplification.htm">amplify</a> what they are saying. 
They neither <a href="defensive_body.htm">defensively</a> hold themselves in nor 
make large <a href="power_body.htm">power</a> moves that grab space. They often 
use open, relaxed palms.</p>
<h2><a name="and"></a>And</h2>
<p>At root, confidence is a lack (or effective control) of
<a href="../../explanations/emotions/fear.htm">fear</a>. A confident person does 
not feel threatened by others, as many of us do. This can lead to false 
confidence and naivety when there is a real threat, which is why an effectively 
confident person has a realistic threat assessment and may well have a 
contingency ready so they know they can cope with dangers as they appear.</p>
<p>There is a fine line between others interpreting your body language as being 
a sign of confidence or or arrogance, so care is needed here. A quietly 
confident person is liked and admired. An arrogant person, on the other hand, is 
disliked and despised. The difference is that the arrogant person uses 
confidence to gain <a href="../../explanations/needs/status.htm">status</a> 
as they feel (or want to feel) superior to others. The quietly confident person, 
on the other hand, feels equal to others. </p>
