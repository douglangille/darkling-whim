<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hands have 27 bones and are a very expressive part of our anatomy. The give us enormous 
capability as an evolved species in how we handle our environment.</p>
<p>Reading palms is not just about the lines on your hand. After the face, hands 
probably the richest source of body language.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that gestures with the hands vary significantly 
across cultures and an 'innocent' hand signal can get you arrested in another 
country.</p>
<p>A hand signal may be small, perhaps betraying subconscious thinking. It may 
also be exaggerated or done with both hands to emphasize the point.</p>
<h2><a name="hol"></a>Holding</h2>
<p>Cupped hands form a container which can hold gently. Gripping hands can hold 
tightly. Hands can hold both individually or together (giving an exaggerated 
effect).</p>
<p>Cupped hands can symbolize delicacy or hold a fragile idea. They may also be 
used for <a href="#giv">giving</a>. Gripping can show possessiveness, ownership 
and desire (the tighter the fist, the stronger the feeling). </p>
<p>Hands may also hold the self, such as when people hold their own hands, 
typically for comfort. Wringing the hands indicates more extreme nervousness.</p>
<p>Holding the self can also be an act of restraint. This can be to let the 
other person talk. It can also be used when the person is angry, effectively 
stopping them from attacking.</p>
<p>The tightness of a holding group indicates the degree of tension the person 
feels. Folded arms can be relaxed, but if the hands hold the opposite arm it 
becomes more restraining.</p>
<p>Holding hands behind the back opens the front and can show confidence. It may 
also conceal hands that display tension. When one hand holds the other arm, the 
higher the hold and tighter the grip, the greater the tension.</p>
<p>The two hands can show different desires, for example 
with one forming a fist and the other holding it back, restraining the desire to 
punch the other person.</p>
<p>Note also that people who are lying often try to control their hands, and 
when they are kept still (often holding one another), you might get suspicious. 
Another sign can be holding them behind the back. As ever, these are only 
possible indicators and you should also look for similar signs.</p>
<p>Hands may also be used to hold items such as pens or cups, which may be used 
as comfort objects, for example where a person hugs a cup (the cup represents 
the person, so they are effectively hugging themself). Holding an item with two 
hands effectively creates a <a href="../closed_body.htm">closed</a> position. </p>
<p>Holding imaginary objects as they are talked about can show importance. 
Things which are important (and perhaps with fear of loss) are held close and 
tight. Things which are not wanted are held further away (or even tossed away). </p>
<p>Even ideas may be held. The bigger and more important the idea, the wider the 
arms are held. A common size is as if they are holding a basketball -- this is 
useful as you can give it to other people. A wide-armed hold may indicate the 
whole world or something massive.</p>
<p>Items may also be for distracting activity that releases nervous energy, such 
as fiddling with a pen, clicking it on and off, or doodling with it.</p>
<p>When hands are clenched together in front of the person, perhaps in a relaxed 
way, the thumbs moving upwards can indicate pleasure at a nice surprise.</p>
<h2><a name="con"></a>Control</h2>
<p>A hand with palm down may figuratively hold or restrain the other person. 
This&nbsp; can be an authoritative action ('Stop that now') or may be a request 
('Please calm down'). This also appears in the <a href="../dominant_body.htm">
dominant</a> hand-on-top handshake. Palms down, leaning on a desk is usually 
dominant ('I'm in charge').</p>
<p>A palm facing outward towards others fends them off or pushes them away in a 
more obvious way than the palms-down signal ('Stop. Do not come any closer!').</p>
<p>A pointing finger or whole hand tells a person where to go ('Leave now!').</p>
<h2><a name="gre"></a>Greeting</h2>
<p>Hands are often used in greetings. The most common form of greeting is shaking hands, of which there are many 
different forms. Opening the palm shows that there is no concealed weapon. This 
is significant in greeting, salutes, waves etc. </p>
<p>This is one of the few times we are allowed to touch the other person and it 
may get used to send various signals.</p>
<p><a href="../dominant_body.htm">Dominance</a> is shown with hand on top, strength, prolonged holding ('I decide 
when to let go') and holding the person with the other hand.</p>
<p>Affection is shown with speed and duration of shake, touching with the other 
hand and enthusiastic smiles. The similarity between dominant and affection 
handshakes leads to tricky situations where a dominant person pretends to be 
friendly.</p>
<p><a href="../submissive_body.htm">Submission</a> is shown with a floppy hand, palm up and which is sometimes clammy 
and with a quick withdrawal.</p>
<p>Most handshakes use vertical palms to show equality, are firm without being 
crushing and for a very exact period (so both know when to let go).</p>
<p>Waving is also used for a greeting and may be done at a distance. </p>
<p>Salutes are sometimes used, but mostly only in the military, where their 
style is strictly prescribed.</p>
<h2><a name="sha"></a>Shaping</h2>
<p>Hands can carve the air, shaping what the person is talking about or meaning. 
They can thus create visual metaphors out of literally nothing.</p>
<p>A man talking may shape a fish he caught. He might also carve out the shape 
of his ideal woman. Other gestures can shape more crudely, indicating holding 
and moving sexually significant body parts.</p>
<h2><a name="cut"></a>Cutting</h2>
<p>The side of a flat hand can appear as a knife, cutting the air like a karate 
chop. The cutting hand may strike the other palm, creating visual and aural 
impact.</p>
<p>A side-swiped cut with palm down tells others to stop what they are doing, 
for example when a person on stage asks the audience to stop clapping so they 
can speak. A short side swipe may also signal 'no' in any conversation.</p>
<p>Cuts can signal aggression, particularly when coupled with an aggressive 
face. They may also indicate decisiveness, chopping with each point. A 
side-swiped cut can chop away someone else's argument.</p>
<h2><a name="str"></a>Striking</h2>
<p>The hand can strike openly, with the palm or closed as a fist. The fist can 
strike forwards, sideways or downwards. One hand is often used for symbols as 
two hands as fists can be an invitation to fight (two hands held inwards can 
also indicate extreme tension).</p>
<p>Fist shapes and movements are often symbols of inner aggression. When moved 
towards a person, even a small amount, they signal aggression towards that 
person. A shaking fist signifies a strong desire to strike someone. Punching the 
air indicates triumphal excitement. </p>
<h2><a name="cov"></a>Covering</h2>
<p>Hands can hide things. When people do not want to hear something, they put 
hands to ears. When they do not want to look, they cover their eyes. When they 
want to say something but feel restrained, they put their hands to their mouth. 
A hand may also cover a rudely open mouth, which may be opened in such as 
surprise or a yawn.</p>
<p>Hands covering the mouth when speaking may be an indicator of lying, although 
it may also just indicate uncertainty. Hands at the mouth can also cover the 
neck, where blushing, swallowing and tension may be seen. This move also 
controls the hands, preventing them from offering other clues (which is why you 
often see card gamblers using this pose).</p>
<p>Hands can cover other things. A hand to heart may seek to protect it from 
shocking harm. A hand to the groin may protect from dangerous attack. Hands can 
also cover one another. Sometimes a tense fist may be covered by the other hand.
</p>
<h2><a name="giv"></a>Giving</h2>
<p>Outstretched palms may offer something to another person. Held with palms 
faced towards one another they might hold something large. Held upwards they 
openly proffer an idea. </p>
<p>They may also show that nothing is being concealed, giving what I have, which 
is nothing.</p>
<p>A single offered hand is the start of the handshake.</p>
<h2><a name="ask"></a>Asking</h2>
<p>Palms offered upwards are a common plea gesture, as if asking for alms. Palms 
downwards may ask a person to calm down.</p>
<p>Palms up or at 45 degrees and then pulled towards the body seeks to bring 
others closer to you in an attenuated beckoning gesture.</p>
<p>Hands with palms pressed together indicate a more anxious pleading. This 
gesture may be done with fingers upwards in a clear prayer position ('Please do 
not harm me!'), and possibly thrust towards the other person. With fingers 
pointing down, this may be more concealed or a less anxious desire for 
agreement. A variant of this is to have fingers interleaved, but otherwise 
making the same shape and movement.</p>

<h2><a name="rub"></a>Rubbing</h2>
<p>Rubbing the hands together can mean that the person is cold. It also means 
the person is feeling particularly gleeful about something. This can be a shared 
benefit and be used in a conspiratorial way.</p>
<p>When they do this less obviously and more slowly, they might thinking that 
they are going to benefit at the expense of someone else. Watch also for small 
smiles and defocused eyes as they imagine a rosy future (at least for them).</p>
<p>Massaging hands together, especially when the hands are quite tense, is 
usually an indicator of stress or anxiety.</p>
<p>Rubbing the face and particularly the chin can indicate thinking, evaluating 
and deciding.</p>
<p>When a part of the body is sore, the person may rub it. This also happens 
when that part of the body is tense, for example the neck or abdomen, and can 
thus be a signal of anxiety.</p>
<p>Light stroking of the body can be a romantic invitation, particularly if the 
erogenous areas (or nearby) are touched. This says 'I would like you to do this' 
and can be very arousing.</p>
<h2><a name="thi"></a>Thinking</h2>
<p>When the fingers are pressed together forming a steepled shape, pointing 
upwards, the person may well be thinking, evaluating or deciding. This may also 
be done with just index fingers pressed together and other fingers interlinked 
('the church'), with all finger-tips touching ('the cage') or with fingers 
interlinked.</p>
<p>Steepling can indicate confidence and a sense of superiority over 
others. It hence can say 'I know something that you do not know.' </p>
<p>When the hands are pressed together more, the person is feeling more tension 
and may be hoping for something ('praying'). The
<a href="face_body_language.htm">face</a> may give more clues about what they 
are thinking and feeling.</p>
<p>The steepled position forms a barrier against the other person and may be 
held lower when the person wants to connect more, such as when they are 
listening.</p>
<p>A subtler version of the evaluative position is with the hand supporting the 
head but with the index finger up the side the of the face. The middle finger 
may cover the mouth ('I'm not ready to talk yet').</p>
<p>These fingers-up positions may include touching of the mouth or chin with the 
fingers, which may indicate the person is thinking about saying something but is 
not yet ready to speak out loud.</p>
<p>The fingers may also be all intertwined and typically held under the chin. 
Again, this is a thinking and evaluating signal.</p>
<p>Hands clenched can be a self-restraining act, effectively holding the person 
back from speaking until they are ready.</p>
<h2><a name="sup"></a>Supporting</h2>
<p>Hands may be used to support the head or even the body when leaning.</p>
<p>Hands wrapped around the cheeks with elbows on the table indicates a heavy 
head and the person may be sleepy or bored. This may also be indicated with a 
single hand propping up the chin or side of the head.</p>
<p>The hands may also lightly support the head, either as a single hand gently 
under the chin or with fingers intertwined with elbows on table and chin 
touching the fingers. Particularly when looking at the other person, this says 
'look at my face, isn't it nice' and may thus be an enticing position.</p>
<p>A lightly supported head may also be a position of listening, where the 
person is holding their head still in order to focus on the other person.</p>
<p>A simple rule is that the more that the head is supported, the more the 
person is bored. When they are interested in what others are saying, support is 
light.</p>
<h2><a name="hid"></a>Hiding</h2>
<p>Hands may be hidden by putting them behind the back, in pockets, under the 
table or sitting on them. They are often used in communication and hiding the hands may indicate a 
desire not to communicate or not to collaborate, saying 'I don't want to talk with you' 
or 'I do not agree with you'.</p>
<p>This may be done in a deliberate gesture of defiance, such as stuffing hands 
in pockets. Liars may hide their hands in fear that they will give themselves away.</p>
<p>Hiding hands may also be a position of listening, sending the message 'I do 
not want to talk because I want to listen to you.'&nbsp; </p>
<p>Putting hands in pockets or behind the back can also be due to just feeling 
relaxed and not needing to talk. </p>
<h2><a name="tou"></a>Touching</h2>
<p>The hand may touch any part of the body in a whole range of situation.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most common reason for touching oneself is self-affirmation ('I 
am here. I am real. I am ok.') and related anxiety. Anxiety can be related to 
concern for the outer world or the inner world of thoughts and forecasts.</p>
<p>Touching is also used in romantic situations, where parts of the body may be 
lightly touched or stroked in simulation of desired or suggested action by the 
other person. The more erotic the parts being touched, the stronger the signal 
is sent.</p>
<p>Touching can also be a form of punishment, for example when a person slaps 
their head ('Bother - I forgot!').</p>
<p>Touching the other person can be an act of domination or of friendship, for 
example a hand on the shoulder whilst telling them off adds authority, whilst a 
gentle touch on the arm when sympathizing demonstrates concern for them.</p>
<h2><a name="usi"></a>Preening</h2>
<p>Preening is a common action as the person brushes their hair and clothes, 
figuratively making themselves look more attractive and sending the signal 
'Aren't I beautiful!' This is thus says 'Please like me' and may be a romantic 
invitation, a signal of superiority or indicate feelings of vulnerability. </p>
<p>Picking at bits of fluff clothes often shows disapproval as the person 
figuratively picks apart your argument.</p>
<h2><a name="wei"></a>Weighing</h2>
<p>Cupped hands may be used to indicate weight, which often is used as a 
metaphor for importance.</p>
<p>Single-handed weighting bounces the cupped hand up and down, for example when 
an argument is being proposed.</p>
<p>Two hands are used to indicate discussion of A vs. B. Watch which hands seems 
to hold the heavier weight -- this will be the one which the person thinks is 
most significant.</p>
<h2><a name="tre"></a>Trembling</h2>
<p>When a person's hands tremble, they may be very frightened or very excited. 
The hands are at the end of the arms and usually have fine control. Dropping 
things likewise can show a loss of that control.</p>
<p>There are also some illnesses where </p>
<h2><a name="and"></a>And...</h2>
<p>Not body language as such, but the length of the index finger compared with 
the length of the ring finger is related to masculinity. High levels of 
testosterone in the womb lead to a longer ring finger. Testosterone is also 
related to other masculine characteristics, including strength and aggression, 
spatial and musical ability. </p>
<p>By looking for long and short ring fingers (as compared with the index 
fingers), you might hence find a tendency towards masculine or feminine 
characteristics.</p>
