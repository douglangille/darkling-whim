<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p>The eyes are often called, with some justification, 'the windows of the soul' 
as they can send many different non-verbal signals. </p>
<p>For reading body language this is quite useful as looking at people's eyes 
are a normal part of communication (whilst gazing at other parts of the body can 
be seen as rather rude).</p>
<p>When a person wears dark glasses, especially indoors, this prevents others 
from reading their eye signals. It is consequently rather disconcerting, which 
is why 'gangsters' and those seeking to appear powerful sometimes wear them.</p>
<h2><a name="up"></a>Looking up</h2>
<p>When a person looks upwards they are often thinking. In particular they are 
probably making pictures in their head and thus may well be an indicator of a 
visual thinker.</p>
<p>When they are delivering a speech or presentation, looking up may be their 
recalling their prepared words.</p>
<p>Looking upwards and to the left can indicate recalling a memory. Looking 
upwards and the right can indicate imaginative construction of a picture (which 
can hence betray a liar). Be careful with this: sometimes the directions are 
reversed -- if in doubt, test the person by asking them to recall known facts or 
imagine something.</p>
<p>Looking up may also be a signal of boredom as the person examines the 
surroundings in search of something more interesting. </p>
<p>Head lowered and eyes looking back up at the other person is a coy and 
suggestive action as it combines the head down of submission with eye contact of 
attraction. It can also be judgemental, especially when combined with a frown.</p>
<h2><a name="dow"></a>Looking down</h2>
<p>Looking at a person can be an act of power and domination. Looking down 
involves not looking at the other person, which hence may be a sign of 
submission ('I am not a threat, really; please do not hurt me. You are so 
glorious I would be dazzled if I looked at you.')</p>
<p>Looking down can thus be a signal of submission. It can also indicate that 
the person is feeling guilty.</p>
<p>A notable way that a lower person looks down at a higher person is by tilting 
their head back. Even taller people may do this.</p>
<p>Looking down and to the left can indicate that they are talking to 
themselves (look for slight movement of the lips). Looking down and to the right 
can indicate that they are attending to internal emotions.</p>
<p>In many cultures where eye contact is a rude or dominant signal, people will 
look down when talking with others in order to show respect.</p>
<h2><a name="sid"></a>Looking sideways</h2>
<p>Much of our field of vision is in the horizontal plane, so when a person 
looks sideways, they are either looking away from what is in front of them or 
looking towards something that has taken their interest.</p>
<p>A quick glance sideways can just be checking the source of a distraction to 
assess for threat or interest. It can also be done to show irritation ('I didn't 
appreciate that comment!').</p>
<p>Looking to the left can indicate a person recalling a sound. Looking to 
the right can indicate that they are imagining the sound. As with visual and 
other movements, this can be reversed and may need checking against known truth 
and fabrication.</p>
<h3>Lateral movement</h3>
<p>Eyes moving from side-to-side can indicate shiftiness and lying, as if the 
person is looking for an escape route in case they are found out. </p>
<p>Lateral movement can also happen when the person is being conspiratorial, as 
if they are checking that nobody else is listening.</p>
<p>Eyes may also move back and forth sideways (and sometimes up and down) when 
the person is visualizing a big picture and is literally looking it over.</p>
<h2><a name="at"></a>Gazing</h2>
<p>Looking at something shows an interest in it, whether it is a painting, a 
table or a person. When you look at something, then others who look at your eyes 
will feel compelled to follow your gaze to see what you are looking at. This is 
a remarkable skill as we are able to follow a gaze very accurately.</p>
<p>When looking at a person normally, the gaze is usually at eye level or above 
(see <a href="#con">eye contact</a>, below). The gaze can also be a defocused 
looking at the general person.</p>
<p>If, after locking gaze, a potential partner keeps looking at the eyes, 
then it may be love. If the eyes slide down over the body, then it is more 
likely to be lust. Exactly where the eyes go is important. Looking at a person's mouth can indicate that you would like to kiss them. 
Looking at sexual regions indicates a desire to have sexual relations with them.</p>
<p>Looking up and down at a whole person is usually sizing them up, either as a 
potential threat or as a sexual partner (notice where the gaze lingers). This 
can be quite insulting and hence indicate a position of presumed dominance, as 
the person effectively says 'I am more powerful than you, your feelings are 
unimportant to me and you will submit to my gaze'.</p>
<p>Looking at their forehead or not at them indicates disinterest. This may also 
be shown by defocused eyes where the person is 'inside their head' thinking 
about other things.</p>
<p><a href="../../willpower/power_gaze.htm">The power gaze</a> is a short but 
intense gaze that is used to impose one's will on another, showing power without 
aggression.</p>
<p>It is difficult to conceal a gaze as we are particularly adept at identifying 
exactly where other people are looking. This is one reason why we have larger 
eye whites than animals, as it aids complex communication.</p>
<p>People who are <a href="../../../explanations/behaviors/lying/lying.htm">
lying</a> may look away more often as they feel guilty when looking at others. 
However, when they know this, they may over-compensate by looking at you for 
longer than usual. This also helps them watch your body language for signs of 
detection.</p>
<p>The acceptable duration of a gaze varies with culture and sometimes even a 
slight glance is unacceptable, such as between genders or by a lower status 
person.</p>
<p>When people are offered a choice in front of them (as in shops), they will 
stare at the options as they evaluate them. They will usually end up looking 
longer at their preferred option, perhaps often looking back at it while they 
scan others. This works in reverse, so if you manage the time available to look 
at things, the item viewed the most is more likely to be that which is chosen.</p>
<p>Non-visual gaze patterns (NVGPs) involve rapid movements (saccades) and 
fixations while we are 'inside our heads', thinking. Rapid movements happen more 
when we are accessing long-term memory and fixations more when we are accessing 
working memory. This is useful to detect whether people are thinking about older 
events or recent events (or old events that are already brought to working 
memory).</p>
<h2><a name="gla"></a>Glancing</h2>
<p>Glancing at something can betray a desire for that thing, for example 
glancing at the door can indicate a desire to leave. </p>
<p>Glancing at a person can indicate a desire to talk with them. It can also 
indicate a concern for that person's feeling when something is said that might 
upset them.</p>
<p>Glancing may indicate a desire to gaze at something or someone where it is 
forbidden to look for a prolonged period.</p>
<p>Glancing sideways at a person with raised eyebrows can be a sign of 
attraction. Without the raised eyebrow it is more likely to be disapproval.</p>
<h2><a name="con"></a>Eye contact</h2>
<p>Eye contact between two people is a powerful act of communication and may 
show interest, affection or dominance. </p>
<h3>Doe eyes</h3>
<p>A softening of the eyes, with relaxing of muscles around the eye and a slight 
defocusing as the person tries to take in the whole person is sometimes called
<i>doe eyes</i>, as it often indicates sexual desire, 
particularly if the gaze is prolonged and the pupils are dilated (<a href="#pup">see 
below</a>). The eyes may also appear shiny.</p>
<h3>Making eye contact</h3>
<p>Looking at a person acknowledges them and shows that you are interested in 
them, particularly if you look in their eyes.</p>
<p>Looking at a person's eyes also lets you know where they are looking. We are 
amazingly good at detecting what they are looking at and can detect even a brief 
glance at parts of our body, for example.</p>
<p>If a person says something when you are looking away and then you make eye 
contact, then this indicates they have grabbed your attention.</p>
<h3>Breaking eye contact</h3>
<p>Prolonged eye contact can be threatening, so in conversation we frequently 
look away and back again.</p>
<p>Breaking eye contact can indicate that something that has just been said that 
makes the person not want to sustain eye contact, for example that they are 
insulted, they have been found out, they feel threatened, etc. This can also 
happen when the person thinks something that causes the same internal 
discomfort.</p>
<p>Looking at a person, breaking eye contact and then looking immediately back 
at them is a classic flirting action, particularly with the head held coyly low 
in suggested submission.</p>
<h3>Long eye contact</h3>
<p>Eye contact longer than normal can have several different meanings.</p>
<p>Eye contact often increases significantly when we are listening, and 
especially when we are paying close attention to what the other person is 
saying. Less eye contact is used when talking, particularly by people who are 
visual thinkers as they stare into the distance or upwards as they 'see' what 
they are talking about.</p>
<p>We also look more at people we like and like people who look at us more. When done with doe eyes and smiles, it is a sign of attraction. Lovers will 
stare into each others eyes for a long period. Attraction is also indicated by 
looking back and forth between the two eyes, as if we are desperately trying to 
determine if they are interested in us too.</p>
<p>An attraction signal that is more commonly used by women is to hold the other 
person's gaze for about three seconds, Then look down for a second or two and 
then look back up again (to see if they have taken the bait). If the other 
person is still looking at them, they are rewarded with a coy smile or a slight 
widening of the eyes ('Yes, this message is for you!').</p>
<p>When done without blinking, contracted pupils and an immobile face, this can indicate 
domination, aggression and use of power. In such circumstances a staring 
competition can ensue, with the first person to look away admitting defeat.</p>
<p>Prolonged eye contact can be disconcerting. A trick to reduce stress from 
this is to look at the bridge of their nose. They will think you are still 
looking in their eyes.</p>
<p>Sometimes liars, knowing that low eye contact is a sign of lying, will 
over-compensate and look at you for a longer than usual period. Often this is 
done without blinking as they force themselves into this act. They may smile 
with the mouth, but not with the eyes as this is more difficult.</p>
<h3>Limited eye contact</h3>
<p>When a person makes very little eye contact, they may be feeling insecure. 
They may also be lying and not want to be detected.</p>
<p>Looking at a person is cognitively taxing as we search for meaning in their 
face and eyes. This is one reason why we tend to look away when we are talking, 
as we can literally run out of mental bandwidth if we kept looking and talking. </p>
<h3>In persuasion</h3>
<p>Eye contact is very important for persuasion. If you look at the other person 
and they do not look back at you, then their attention is likely elsewhere. Even 
if they hear you, the lack of eye contact reduces the personal connection.</p>
<p>If you want to persuade or change minds, then the first step is to gain eye 
contact and then sustain it with regular reconnection.</p>
<h2><a name="sta"></a>Staring</h2>
<p>Staring is generally done with eyes wider than usual, prolonged attention to 
something and with reduced blinking. It generally indicates particular interest 
in something or someone.</p>
<p>Staring at a person can indicate shock and disbelief, particularly after 
hearing unexpected news.</p>
<p>When the eyes are defocused, the person's attention may be inside their head 
and what they are staring at may be of no significance. (Without care, this can 
become quite embarrassing for them).</p>
<p>Prolonged eye contact can be aggressive, affectionate or deceptive and is 
discussed further above. Staring at another's eyes is usually more associated 
with aggressive action.</p>
<p>A short stare, with eyes wide open and then back to normal indicates 
surprise. The correction back to normal implies that the person would like to 
stare more, but knows it is impolite (this may be accompanied with some 
apologetic text).</p>
<p>When a person stares at another, then the second person may be embarrassed 
and look away. If they decide to stare back, then the people 'lock eyes' and 
this may become a competition with the loser being the person who looks away 
first. </p>
<p>The length of an acceptable stare varies across cultures, as does who is 
allowed to stare, and at what. Babies and young children stare more, until they 
have learned the cultural rules.</p>
<h2><a name="fol"></a>Following</h2>
<p>The eyes will naturally follow movement of any kind. If the person is looking 
at something of interest then they will naturally keep looking at this. They 
also follow neutral or feared things in case the movement turns into a threat.</p>
<p>This is used when sales people move something like a pen or finger up and 
down, guiding where the customer looks, including to eye contact and to parts of 
the product being sold.</p>
<h2><a name="squ"></a>Squinting</h2>
<p>Narrowing of a person's eyes can indicate evaluation, perhaps considering 
that something told to them is not true (or at least not fully so). </p>
<p>Squinting can also indicate uncertainty ('I cannot quite see what is meant 
here.')</p>
<p>Narrowing eyes has a similar effect to constricted pupils in creating a 
greater depth of field so you can see more detail. This is used by animals when 
determining distance to their prey and can have a similar aggressive purpose.</p>
<p>Squinting can be used by liars who do not want the other person to 
detect their deception.</p>
<p>When a person thinks about something and does not want to look at the 
internal image, they may involuntarily squint.</p>
<p>Squinting can also happen when lights or the sun are bright.</p>
<p>Lowering of eyelids is not really a squint but can have a similar meaning. It 
can also indicate tiredness. </p>
<p>Lowering eyelids whilst still looking at the other person can be a part of a 
romantic and suggestive cluster, and may be accompanied with tossing back the
head and slightly puckering the
<a href="lips_body_language.htm">lips</a> in a kiss.</p>
<h2><a name="bli"></a>Blinking</h2>
<p>Blinking is a neat natural process whereby the eyelids wipe the eyes clean, 
much as a windscreen wiper on a car.</p>
<p>Blink rate tends to increase when people are thinking more or are feeling 
stressed. This can be an 
indication of lying as the liar has to keep thinking about what they are saying. 
Realizing this, they may also force their eyes open and appear to stare.</p>
<p>Blinking can also indicate rapport, and people who are connected may blink 
at the same rate. Someone who is listening carefully to you is more likely to 
blink when you pause (keeping eyes open to watch everything you say). </p>
<p>Beyond natural random blinking, a single blink can signal surprise that the 
person does not quite believe what they see ('I'll wipe my eyes clean to better 
see').</p>
<p>Rapid blinking blocks vision and can be an arrogant signal, saying 'I am so 
important, I do not need to see you'.</p>
<p>Rapid blinking also flutters the eyelashes and can be a coy romantic 
invitation.</p>
<p>Reduced blinking increases the power of a stare, whether it is romantic or 
dominant in purpose. </p>
<h2><a name="win"></a>Winking</h2>
<p>Closing one eye in a wink is a deliberate gesture that often suggests 
conspiratorial ('You and I both understand, though others do not').</p>
<p>Winking can also be a slightly suggestive greeting and is reminiscent of a 
small wave of the hand ('Hello there, gorgeous!'). </p>
<h2><a name="clo"></a>Closing</h2>
<p>Closing the eyes shuts out the world. This can mean 'I do not want to see 
what is in front of me, it is so terrible'.</p>
<p>Sometimes when people are talking they close their eyes. This is an 
equivalent to turning away so eye contact can be avoided and any implied request 
for the other person to speak is effectively ignored.</p>
<p>Visual thinkers may also close their eyes, sometimes when talking, so they 
can better see the internal images without external distraction.</p>
<h2><a name="dam"></a>Damp</h2>
<p>The tear ducts provide moisture to the eyes, both for washing them and for 
tears. </p>
<p>Damp eyes can be suppressed weeping, indicating anxiety, fear or sadness. It 
can also indicate that the person has been crying recently.</p>
<p>Dampness can also occur when the person is tired (this may be accompanied by 
redness of the eyes. </p>
<h2><a name="tea"></a>Tears</h2>
<p>Actual tears that roll down the cheeks are often a symptom of extreme fear or 
sadness, although paradoxically you can also weep tears of joy.</p>
<p>Weeping can be silent, with little expression other than the tears 
(indicating a certain amount of control). It also typically involves screwing up 
of the face and, when emotions are extreme, can be accompanied by 
uncontrollable, convulsive sobs. </p>
<p>Men in many culture are not expected to cry and learn to suppress this 
response, not even being able to cry when alone. Even if their eyes feel damp 
they may turn away.</p>
<p>Tears and sadness may be transformed into anger, which may be direct at 
whoever is available.</p>
<h2><a name="pup"></a>Pupil size</h2>
<p>A subtle signal that is sometimes detected only subconsciously and is seldom 
realized by the sender is where the pupil gets larger (dilates) or contracts.</p>
<p>Sexual desire is a common cause of pupil dilation, and is sometimes called 
'doe eyes' or 
'bedroom eyes' (magazine pictures sometimes have deliberately doctored 
eyes to make a model look more attractive). When another person's eyes dilate we 
may be attracted further to them and our eyes dilate in return. Likewise, when 
their pupils are small, ours may well contract also. We also dilate pupils for 
people we just like or admire. This can be useful for determining a person's 
loyalties (eg. by showing them a picture of a politician).</p>
<p>Pupils dilate also when it is darker to let in more light. Perhaps this is 
why clubs, bars, restaurants and other romantic venues are so dingy.</p>
<p>A reversal of attraction dilation is that pupils will constrict when someone 
is disgusted or is not attracted to the other person (I don't want to see you).</p>
<p>A fundamental cause of eye dilation is cognitive effort. When we are thinking 
more, our eyes dilate. This helps explain 'doe eyes' as when we like others 
people, looking at them leads to significant thinking about how we may gain and 
sustain their attention. Yet pupil constriction can indicate an overloaded brain 
(perhaps trying to shut out the world, as when people close eyes for an 
'extended blink').</p>
<p>Reputedly, people who are about to make a bad decision will have more dilated 
pupils. </p>
<p>People with dark irises (the colored circle around the pupil) can look 
attractive because it is difficult to distinguish the iris from the pupil, with 
the effect is that their dark pupils look larger than they are. People with 
light irises make the pupils easier to see, so when their pupils actually do 
dilate then the signal is clearer to detect, making them more attractive 'at the 
right time'.</p>
<p>The reverse of this is that pupils contract when we do not like the other 
person, perhaps in an echo of squint-like narrowing of the eyes. People with 
small pupils can hence appear threatening or just unpleasant.</p>
<p>While there are many different reasons for pupil dilation or constriction, a 
simple point to remember is that, in general, dilated pupils are positive while 
constricted pupils are negative. A useful general point also is that dilated 
pupils means 'I want more' and constricted means 'I want to see less'.</p>
<p>Pupils which have lesser diameter than 3mm or greater than 6.5mm can indicate 
a person on drugs (police will look for this). Pupils which are unequal in size, 
non-round or non-reactive to light can indicate brain damage (this is why 
doctors may flash a light in your eyes after you have fallen).</p>

<h2><a name="rub"></a>Rubbing</h2>
<p>When a person is feeling uncomfortable, the eyes may water a little. To cover 
this and try to restore an appropriate dryness, they person may rub their eye 
and maybe even feign tiredness or having something in the eye. This also gives 
the opportunity to turn the <a href="head_body_language.htm">head</a> away.</p>
<p>The rubbing may be with one finger, with a finger and thumb (for two eyes) or 
with both hands. The more the coverage, the more the person is trying to hide 
behind the hands.</p>
<h2>Lines in the eyes</h2>
<p>The Pax6 gene affects parts of the brain (in the left anterior cingulate 
cortex) which regulate approach-related tendencies. This gene also affects lines 
appearing in the eye. The surprise result is that people with radial lines in 
the iris tend to be warm and tender minded. Those with concentric lines in the 
iris that curve around the pupil indicate impulsiveness. </p>
