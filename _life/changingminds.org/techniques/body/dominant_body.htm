<h1>Dominant Body Language</h1>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dominant body language is related to <a href="aggressive_body.htm">aggressive 
body language</a>, though with a less emotional content. </p>
<h2><a name="siz"></a>Size signals</h2>
<p>The body in dominant stances is generally <a href="open_body.htm">open</a>, 
and may also include additional aspects.</p>
<h3>Making the body big</h3>
<p>Hands on hips makes the elbows go wide and make the body seem larger. So also 
does standing upright and erect, with the chin up and the chest thrust out. Legs 
may be placed apart to increase size.</p>
<h3>Making the body high</h3>
<p>Height is also important as it gives an attack advantage. This can be achieved by standing up straight or 
somehow getting the other person lower than you, for example by putting them on 
a lower seat or by your standing on a step or plinth.</p>
<h3>Occupying territory</h3>
<p>By invading and occupying territory that others may own or use, control and 
dominance is indicated. A dominant person may thus stand with feet akimbo and 
hands on hips.</p>
<h2><a name="sup"></a>Superiority signals</h2>
<h3>Breaking social rules</h3>
<p>Rulers do not need to follow rules: they <i>make </i>the rules. This power to 
decide one's own path is often displayed in breaking of social rules, from 
invasion and interruption to casual swearing in polite company.</p>
<h3>Ownership</h3>
<p>Owning something that others covet provides a status symbol. This can be 
territorial, such as a larger office, or displays of wealth or power, such as a 
Rolex watch or having many subordinates.</p>
<p>Just owning things is an initial symbol, but in body language it is the 
flaunting of these, often casually, that is the power display. Thus a senior 
manager will casually take out their Mont Blanc pen whilst telling their 
secretary to fetch the Havana cigars.</p>
<h3>Invasion</h3>
<p>A dominant act is to disrespect the ownership of others, invading their 
territory, for example getting to close to them by moving into their
<a href="../../explanations/behaviors/body_language/proxemics.htm">body space</a>. 
Other actions include sitting on their chairs, leaning on their cars, putting 
feet up on their furniture and being over-friendly with their romantic partners.</p>
<p>Invasion says 'What's yours is mine' and 'I can take anything of yours that I 
want and you cannot stop me'. </p>
<h3>Dominant positions</h3>
<p>A dominant person will take higher status physical positions where they can 
see and be seen by more other people. </p>
<p>If the table is rectangular, they will sit at the end. Likewise, they will 
sit on a corner seat. They will also stand in the middle of a group where they 
will have their backs to some people (but will not fear attack).</p>
<p>They will also walk down the middle of a path or corridor and expect others 
to get out of the way. Negotiations for moving over start a long way off and 
they signal by not making any moves that others will have to move.</p>
<h3>Dominating time</h3>
<p>Dominant people will seek to control time more. For example in conversations, 
they may talk more themselves and deny others time to talk, for example by 
interruption or leaving early. </p>
<p>Another method is hurrying, talking fast themselves, checking the time and 
asking that others 'be brief'.</p>
<p>Outside of conversations, they may not be available when you need them but 
then demand your attention immediately.</p>
<h3>Belittling others</h3>
<p>Superiority signals are found both in saying 'I am important' and also 'You 
are not important'. Thus a dominant person may ignore or interrupt another 
person who is speaking or turn away from them. They may criticize the 
inferior person, including when the other person can hear them. </p>
<p>They may inspect their fingernails or otherwise show limited attention to the 
other person. General <a href="core_patterns/preening.htm">preening</a> can 
likewise show a lack of respect. Stroking the chin shows judgement.</p>
<h3>Facial signals</h3>
<p>Much dominance can be shown in the 
<a href="parts_body_language/face_body_language.htm">face</a>, from disapproving frowns and pursed 
lips to sneers and snarls (sometimes disguised as smiles). </p>
<p>The eyes can be used to stare and hold the gaze 
for long period. They may also squint, preventing the other person seeing where 
you are looking. They may also look at anywhere but the other person, 
effectively saying that 'you are not even worth looking at'. Narrowing eyes 
shows suspicion or even dislike.</p>
<p>Faces can also look bored, amused or express other expressions that belittle 
the other person. The head will often move very little.</p>
<p>A surprisingly effective trick is in holding the head still. Most people move 
their head as they talk and interact with others. We watch the faces of others a 
great deal and stillness in the head and face signals comfort and lack of 
anxiety.</p>
<p>Dominant people often smile much less than submissive people.</p>
<p>The &#39;Alpha face&#39; of the dominant alpha male includes lowered eyebrows (stern, 
judging), narrowed eyes (evaluating) and a firmly closed mouth with no smile 
(serious).</p>
<h3>Phallic displays</h3>
<p>Dominant men will often expose their crotch, effectively saying to other men 
'I am safe from attack' or 'my penis is bigger than yours', whilst showing off. 
They may also be offering 'come and get it!' to women. When women do this, it is to some extent a tease or invitation to men 
but may also be an emulation of the male display, thus saying 'I am as strong as 
a man'.</p>
<p>This appears in standing or sitting where the legs are apart. It may be 
emphasized by scratching or adjusting of the crotch.</p>
<h2><a name="dom"></a>The dominant greeting</h2>
<p>When people first meet and <a href="greeting.htm">greet</a>, their first interaction sets the pattern for the 
future relationship. When a person is dominant here, then they will most likely 
continue to be dominant. </p>
<h3>The handshake</h3>
<p>A classic dominant handshake is with the palm down, symbolically being on 
top. Another form of dominant handshake is to use strength to squeeze the other 
person.</p>
<p>Holding the other person's hand for longer than normal also shows that you 
are in control.</p>
<h3>Eyes</h3>
<p>Prolonged, unblinking <a href="parts_body_language/eyes_body_language.htm">
eye</a> contact acts like overplaying the handshake -- it 
says 'I am powerful, I can break the rules.' The dominant person may 
alternatively prevent eye contact, saying 'You are beneath me and I do not want 
even to look at you.'</p>
<h3>Speaking</h3>
<p>The person who speaks first often gets to control the conversation, either by 
talking for longer or by managing the questions.</p>
<h2>And...</h2>
<p>Bohns and Wiltermuth (2012) found that just putting the body in a dominant position, upright 
and open, reduces a person's sensitivity to pain, possibly because this 
increases the sense of <a href="../../explanations/needs/control.htm">control</a>.</p>
<p>Carney, Cuddy and Yap (2010) also found that adopting a powerful pose changes 
your hormonal levels and increases your propensity to take risks, just as if you 
were more powerful.</p>
<p>In generalized gender differences, women often make themselves smaller while 
men spread out. Even when women are seeking equality, this can happen, showing 
internal processes that not in alignment with their conscious intent.</p>
<h2><a name="res"></a>Responding to dominance</h2>
<p>If others display dominant body language you have a range of options. </p>
<p>The simplest response is simply not to submit, which is what they probably 
want. Continue to appear friendly and ignore their subtle signals.</p>
<p>Another response is to fight dominance with dominance, for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Out-stare them (a trick here is to look at the bridge of their nose, not 
  their eyes).</li>
  <li>Touch them, either before they touch you or immediately when they touch 
  you.</li>
  <li>When they do a power handshake, grab their elbow and step to the side.</li>
  <li>When they butt in to your speech, speed up, talk more loudly and say 'let 
  me finish!'</li>
</ul>
<p>Another approach is to name the game. Ask them why they are using dominant 
body language. A good way to do this is in a curious, unafraid way.</p>
