<p class="smaller" align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Noam Chomsky, a well-known social critic, and Edward Herman developed a model 
of how news gets shaped by a number of 'filters'. The general principle is that 
power is concentrated in relatively few un-elected individuals and corporations, 
and that this leads to selectivity, filtering and sanitization of news stories 
such that what reaches the general public is only that which supports the 
purpose 
of those few stakeholders, who typically seek to maximize personal power and corporate 
profit.</p>

<h2><a name="own"></a>Ownership and money</h2>
<p>It is in the nature of capitalism that companies compete with one another, 
that some grow and succeed while others fail and close. This eventually leads to 
markets being dominated by a few very large firms. Often, there is a single 
leader, a challenger and a bunch of also-rans (for example in the cola market).</p>
<p>Not only does ownership get concentrated, so also does power. When control of 
competition is lax, larger firms can use subterfuge and the simple weight of 
their capital and ability in order to sabotage or take over competitors.</p>
<p>Any company is there to serve the aims of its owner, which can be altruistic. 
But, when companies are publicly listed and shares traded, the nature of share 
markets means the owners now only seek increased the shorter-term financial gain 
of higher share price or dividends. A day trader on Wall Street cares little for employees or the greater good. This 
ripples down to motivation of senior officers, many of who have share options, to focus very largely on 
short-term reported gain. </p>
<p>The Herman-Chomsky model concentrates on the media industry where there are 
relatively few, large companies that dominate many of the news channels. Even 
with the advent of the internet, the control is gradually being regained, for 
example through ownership of key hubs and influencing control-oriented 
legislation.</p>
<h2><a name="fun"></a>Funding and advertising</h2>
<p>As above, money is both essential for business survival and can be a 
motivator by itself. This leads to the question of how things get funded. For 
news and media, this can be either a subscription model or through advertising. 
Many newspapers and magazines use a combination model, with both a cover price 
and advertising that helps to reduce the price to consumers. TV uses varied 
methods, from the universal subscription model of the UK's BBC to advertising 
only to a combination. The internet may also use a variety, although many sites 
provide information free and depend on advertising for funds.</p>
<p>When advertising is a key source of funds, all articles, shows and so on will 
be viewed with regard to what advertising 
revenues may be gained from them. This then leads to caution on the part of 
editors and media managers not to rock the boat by airing issues that may upset their major 
advertisers (who will not be shy in withdrawing their funds if they feel they 
are being slighted in any way). Further, advertisers may deliberately support 
items which offer biased views that help them and which mislead the viewing 
public.</p>
<p>On the internet, search engine listing is a critical desirable factor and 
advertisers will be significantly influenced by this. The internet also gives 
far more immediate and accurate data that allows even more manipulative and 
finely-tuned advertising that will rapidly shape what is produced and published.</p>
<h2><a name="sou"></a>Sourcing of information and expertise</h2>
<p>When news stories appear, where do they come from? With relatively few key 
sources for news, this also becomes a filter point. Smaller (and even larger) 
news organizations often source their news items from what is available via easy 
channels rather than sending reporters out on every street. The pressure to 
publish at minimum cost also means that very little time is spent in checking out how true these 
stories are.</p>
<p>It is very much in the interests of those in power to control the news. 
Companies and governments have large marketing and PR departments which create 
press releases that news organizations accept with little challenge. 
Organizations may 
also offer experts for interview who of course will support their employers' 
goals. Even academic research is often funded by interested parties such 
that 'scientific knowledge' may be full of bias.</p>
<p>There is a concentrating effect on the internet where, although many 
can write what they like, only a few gain significant attention. In the same way 
that industries end up dominated by a few major players, information channels 
also end up with a few powerful writers who may easily be seduced (or coerced) 
by powerful other parties.</p>
<h2><a name="fla"></a>The covering fire of flak</h2>
<p>Sometimes information does leak out that those in power do not like. They 
still have plenty of options to respond to such problems, from generous 
compensation to unhappy customers whose complaints have gone viral, to corporate 
lawyers who threaten and perhaps sue those who oppose them, even to the point of 
causing financial ruin or imprisonment. Such situations then may become the 
stuff of cautionary tales which are used to point out the error in opposing 'big 
brother'.</p>
<p>There are many other forms of flak, such as publishing blogs, newsletters, 
making speeches, sponsorship, supporting legislation, phone calls and other 
methods of buying off, wearing down or punishing those who would oppose or 
otherwise create a nuisance. Done well, dissenters do not even bother to make 
themselves heard when they think of the personal risks they will be taking.</p>
<h2><a name="ant"></a>Anti-communism and fear</h2>
<p>At the highest level, demons may be created that both transfix whole 
populations and which may be used as an excuse for measures such as increased 
security, media control and support of such as military industries. In America, 
for many years, communism was the demon. After the demise of the Soviet 
Republic, a new demon was found first in Iraq then in Islamist terrorism. The 
mood is further amplified by movies and TV series that dramatize fears.</p>
<p>Fear is a powerful driver and causes people to look for someone to save them. 
They will also accept things that otherwise they might not like. A general fear 
propagated throughout the population makes them more pliable. Communism and terrorism are just 
two ways to create fear. Other very realistic fears include loss of one's 
savings or house, loss of job, and so on. News headlines often play to such fear 
triggers.</p>
