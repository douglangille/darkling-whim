<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Sometimes when people are talking with you they are frustrated or angry about 
something. This creates and builds internal tension as they think about the gap 
between what is and what they think should be. This pressure drives them to 
expel the discomfort, to vent their feelings, having a rant at whoever will 
listen. </p>
<h2><a name="def"></a>Don't defend </h2>
<p>When people rant at us, a natural response is to defend ourselves (or just 
leave) in a <a href="../../explanations/brain/fight_flight.htm">fight-or-flight 
reaction</a>. We experience 
their anger and feel uncomfortable. Perhaps because of their words we feel they 
are angry at us. Maybe we just find it difficult to cope with our own negative 
feelings and want them to stop. </p>
<p>But if we respond critically, the situation may turn into an argument that 
does more harm than good. They may use your rising anger to facilitate and 
legitimate their continued expulsion of hurt, which may make them feel better 
about the original situation but then worse again as your relationship with them 
suffers. They may alternatively realize you are unable to listen to them and 
retreat, stopping their rant and still feeling bad. </p>
<h2><a name="don"></a>Don't advise </h2>
<p>Another response is to offer advice. This can be defensive as we deflect 
attention back onto the other person. It may be well-intentioned yet still 
ineffective as the person is not ready for advice as they are too full of 
emotion to stop and listen calmly. </p>
<p>We go into parent mode as we tell them what they should do. Or we become 
friendly problem solvers, treating their situation as a puzzle that needs 
fixing. However, even if we ask probing or Socratic questions, this can still 
just make matters worse and they may turn their anger directly on us, perhaps 
pushing us into the defending trap. </p>
<h2><a name="lis"></a>Don't just listen </h2>
<p>When a person is ranting, they are not seeking advice. They just want to feel 
better by pushing out their bad feelings. When we realize this we may conclude 
they just want us to listen, so we do. </p>
<p>But sitting and silently listening is not enough. They are trying to push out 
bad feelings, not make an eloquent speech. While just listening can help, there 
are better things to do than just sitting there and saying nothing.</p>
<h2><a name="sym"></a>Don't over-sympathize </h2>
<p>A further response that we may offer is to take their part, agreeing they are 
right and joining them in righteous indignation. While this may help, it can 
also intensify and prolong their feelings of anger. Now, having a partner, the 
annoyance becomes a cause which is fired by continuing high emotion. </p>
<h2><a name="wha"></a>What they want</h2>
<p>First of all they want to be recognized and their hurt acknowledged. They 
want you to accept what they say without criticism. </p>
<p>Then they want to know that they are justified in their anger. That they are 
not personally bad for feeling this way. That it normal for them to be 
frustrated at the situation in which they find themselves. </p>
<p>They may also appreciate your help in getting out those feelings. When we are 
in an emotional state, we are not good at understanding how to expel the 
discomfort and feel better. </p>
<h2><a name="kno"></a>Know that it is not you</h2>
<p>The first step of helping is to realize that their frustrations are theirs. 
Even if they are projecting anger directly at you, the anger is always theirs. 
It is also very likely that you are not the problem. You just happen to be there and you may feel the 
sharpness of their tongue, but it is important not to feel you are personally 
being blamed, nor that it is somehow all your fault. </p>
<p>When you know that it is not you, then you have no need to defend and can 
place your energies in helping the other person. If it really is you, then a 
simply <a href="../conversation/excusing/apology.htm">apology</a> may be 
appropriate along with the effective listening described here.</p>
<h2><a name="hel"></a>&nbsp;Help them draw the sting</h2>
<p>When a bee stings you and leaves the barb in your skin, you need someone to 
help carefully draw out that sting. It is similar with frustration and anger, 
where the drawing of the sting can be done with 
facilitative questions that bleed out the emotion, leaving the person calmer and 
relieved.</p>
<p>There is an optimal rate at which to release painful emotion. Too fast and the 
pain will be unbearable, sending them into shock. Too slow and the pain will be 
drawn out, prolonging the agony and maybe never really curing the problem.</p>
<p>A good early question is to ask what it is that is <i>frustrating</i> them. If they 
answer vaguely, ask about what frustrates them <i>most</i>. This should help them focus 
on the cause of their feelings. It is a non-judgemental question that avoids 
making them want to defend themselves. </p>
<p>Then asking about what is making them <i>angry</i> goes to deeper emotions, 
drawing out stronger feelings. Note the difference between 'What is making you 
angry?' and 'Why are you angry?' Asking 'what' allows them to keep attention 
outside them, on other people and situations. Asking 'why' pushes attention 
inside them, seeking what it is about them that leads them to anger. This is a 
deeper challenge for which they may not be ready.</p>
<p>You can see the anger coming out through the language they use. Notice 
absolute words like 'never' and 'always'. Hear emotion in their voices and 
emotive words like 'failed' and 'again'. </p>
<p>When the anger has subsided, ask what is <i>worrying</i> them. This often gets to 
the heart of the matter as it is our inner 
<a href="../../explanations/emotions/anxiety.htm">anxieties</a> that lead to external 
frustration and anger.
<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="adv"></a>Don't blindly follow this advice </h2>
<p>While there is clear advice here on how to handle anger, the 'don'ts' above 
are not commands and there are times when all of them can be appropriate, such 
as: </p>
<ul>
	<li>When their anger at you is severe, your defending yourself may make them realize they 
are over-doing it and be shocked into rethinking their whole situation.</li>
	<li>When they are not lost in the emotion, advice may be heard and appreciated.
	</li>
	<li>When they are clear about what they want to say, just quiet listening may be 
enough. </li>
	<li>When they are sad, sympathy can make them feel better. </li>
</ul>
<p>The skill of listening to anger is knowing what will work best right now. 
This comes from trying different approaches and finding what works for you in 
different situations. When doing this, take note of the suggestions here, being 
cautious of your own needs getting in the way and knowing that what seems right 
may not always be the best way.</p>
