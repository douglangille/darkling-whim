<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="../../questioning/questioning.htm">Questions</a> from the audience 
are a difficult topic for speakers who, by definition, are predisposed to speak 
more than listen. Handling questions is a tricky business and can derail your 
presentation if not handled carefully.</p>
<h2><a name="pre"></a>Preparing for questions</h2>
<p>Do not wait until your audience asks you a question during your presentation, 
especially if the presentation is important (which it always is for your 
reputation at least).</p>
<h3>Brainstorm possible questions</h3>
<p>Start by brainstorming possible questions that your audience might ask. Walk 
through your talk, particularly the more challenging parts, and write a list of 
the questions that may be asked of each point. </p>
<h3>Select key questions</h3>
<p>This should give you a long list. The next job is to whittle this down to a 
list of questions that is best worth your time in developing good answers. </p>
<p>First strike out the trivial questions that you can answer easily on the fly. 
Be careful with this as simple questions can have complex answers. Also, before 
striking out a question, think about the next question the same person would ask 
if they did not accept your answer.</p>
<p>Next put an asterisk against the questions that might need a longer answer. 
Then add a second asterisk against questions where a complete answer would be 
difficult to give. Then add a third asterisk to questions that would seriously 
challenge you.</p>
<h3>Develop clear answers</h3>
<p>Now, starting with the three-star questions, develop good answers. Sometimes 
the answer might be an admission of ignorance, though with a good follow-up 
viewpoint. Sometimes you may need to do a bit more research, for example to get 
solid data to back up your claims. </p>
<p>Check out the notes below for more ideas.&nbsp; </p>
<h2><a name="whe"></a>When to take questions</h2>
<p>A difficult question for speakers is when to take questions. Many would 
prefer not to have any, yet it an effective question time can be the most 
powerful part of your presentation and give the audience strong reasons to 
remember you and your ideas.</p>
<p>Depending on the situation, you may or may not have the choice of whether to 
take questions, for example where organisers decide when questions can and 
cannot be taken (although it can sometimes be a powerful move to ignore this 
ruling).</p>
<h3>At the end</h3>
<p>The traditional place where questions are asked is after the presentation has 
completed. This is certainly easier for the speaker and perhaps also for most of 
the audience for whom breaking the flow of learning can be very disrupting.</p>
<p>Another advantage of taking questions at the end is that you can close the 
talk at the allotted time by not taking any more questions ('Sorry, we've run 
out of time.'). It is common to allow between five to twenty minutes for 
questions, depending on the talk duration and situation, and sometimes more 
(such as when your talk is simply to spur a debate). </p>
<p>A good reason to include final questions is that some people are slow to 
formulate their questions and actually need the duration of the speech to figure 
out how to articulate their questions. This of course is more difficult for them 
towards the end, although they may still get their questions in towards the end 
of question time.</p>
<p>The big problem with this is that questions occur to people along the way and 
by the end they may have forgotten. The rest of the audience are even more 
likely to forget the context, making the questioner's questions largely 
unintelligible. </p>
<h3>On the fly</h3>
<p>A potentially more powerful method is to allow people to ask questions on the 
fly. To do this requires a more assured and confident speaker who can smoothly 
answer questions and then continue, unruffled, with the talk.</p>
<p>A problem with ad-hoc questions is that they can eat into time in an 
unpredictable manner. Again, a more comfortable speaker will manage questioners 
so they do not take too much time and then change their presentation so that it 
still flows and completes well on time.</p>
<p>Some talks, such as sales presentations, are very likely to have unavoidable 
mid-flow questioning. This is one reason that sales people become skilful at 
handling questions -- if they do not, then they will have significant problems.</p>
<h3>After each section</h3>
<p>A balance between taking questions at the end and on the fly is to stop after 
each of several sections within the presentation and ask for questions. You can 
then cover off queries whilst the topic is fresh in everyone's mind.</p>
<h3>Afterwards</h3>
<p>You can also take questions after your presentation is complete and you are 
away from the speaking platform. Go mingle with the crowds. Have a drink or 
dinner with them. Ask them questions and answer the further questions they ask 
you.</p>
<p>This can be difficult for shyer speakers who like the protective distance the 
platform gives. Most people, however, find this more comfortable and it can be a 
practical alternative to handling on-stage questions.</p>
<p>You can also let people contact you electronically, for example by giving 
them your email or social networking address. It can be a neat method to swap 
business cards if you also want to gain a circle of contacts.</p>
<h2><a name="fir"></a>First of all...</h2>
<p>When you are asked a question, there are a couple of rules that many speakers 
forget but which are absolutely critical. </p>
<h3>Hear the question</h3>
<p>First, listen intently to the questioner. Hear all of their words. Watch 
their body language. Hear the intent and emotion. If you do not understand what 
they say, you will have to ask them to repeat themselves, though as this is 
embarrassing for you and especially them it is best avoided.</p>
<h3>Repeat the question</h3>
<p>The next step is as important as it is simple: repeat the question. Unless 
the questioner is not passed a microphone, many other people will not have heard 
the question, which will make your answer meaningless to them. </p>
<p>Repeating the question also lets you check that you have heard them 
correctly. This is often best done paraphrasing the question and perhaps 
simplifying it (many people use a lot of words to ask a simple question). </p>
<p>It is obvious but bears repeating: when you are checking that the question is 
correct, directly address the person asking the question.</p>
<p>If the question is asked somewhat later than the context of your speech about 
which it is targeted, then it can also be helpful to remind the audience 
something more about what was asked.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p class="quote"><i>&quot;So you are asking whether elephants could survive climate 
change, is that right? </i>(watch for nod) <i>And it is about my point earlier 
that many more species might become extinct, is that right? </i>(watch again for 
agreement) </p>
<h2><a name="typ"></a>Types of question</h2>
<p>There are many types of question a speaker might be asked. Here are a few 
categories and some of the answers you might give.</p>
<h3>Banal questions</h3>
<p>Some questions seem so stupid and answers so obvious, you might wonder 
whether the questioner was listening at all or perhaps needs a decimal point in 
their IQ. This may be highlighted by little murmurs of contempt from other 
members of the audience.</p>
<p>Whatever they ask, it is not a good idea to look at them as if they were from 
a different planet. It may be how your teachers treated you sometimes and it may 
be what you feel like doing, but always treat them with respect and answer the 
question. Keep the answer short and clear.</p>
<h3>Off-topic questions</h3>
<p>It is not uncommon to be asked a question about something entirely unrelated 
to the presentation, especially if you are known for other matters, such as 
having written a book on a different topic or are a known authority.</p>
<p>Again, it is normal to be respectful and answer the question. Again, a 
briefer answer is often appreciated by the wider audience.</p>
<h3>Interesting questions</h3>
<p>A speaker's dream is an interesting question about which you can talk for a 
long time. The challenge here is to be brief. Your audience has heard your main 
speech. This is an answer to one question and there are more to answer. Show 
your enthusiasm, but do not let it run away with you.</p>
<h3>Challenging questions</h3>
<p>Some questions are not very easy to answer. They may test your knowledge or 
be difficult to explain briefly. You can tell them because the words for the 
answer do not easily come to mind. The best approach here is to acknowledge the 
challenge, for example by saying something like 'This is a tricky question but I 
will do my best to explain.' The worst thing to do is to bluster or challenge 
the person in return. </p>
<h3>Critical comments</h3>
<p>Sometimes you will get comments (or comments dressed as questions) that seem 
intended simply to criticize or oppose what you have presented. Sometimes it may 
also seem that it is intended as a
<a href="../../../disciplines/argument/fallacies/attack_person.htm">personal 
attack</a>.</p>
<p>When this happens, the first thing to remember is not to rise to the bait. Do 
not get angry or upset and never criticize the person in return or you will lose 
the entire audience. You can simply disagree. You can ask them what they mean. 
Or you can ignore the attack and answer the comment as if it were a legitimate 
question.</p>
<h2><a name="int"></a>Interacting with the questioner</h2>
<p>When you interact with a single questioner you are, by proxy, interacting 
with the whole audience, who will empathize with questioners who are naturally 
more like them than the person on the stage.</p>
<h3>Respect, always</h3>
<p>The first rule of interaction is respect. Always respect the person even if 
they make a personal attack. This means being polite in your responses. You 
should also be <a href="../../assertiveness/assertiveness.htm">assertive</a> and 
not cowed by aggression. Stay calm and clear and the audience will stay with 
you.</p>
<h3>Give them time to think</h3>
<p>Some people have immediate questions whilst others take time to formulate 
their queries. A way of giving them time is to pause and give space even when it 
seems questions have ended. It can take a little courage to stand there whilst 
nobody is saying anything but you will find that questions do appear and they 
are often good ones.</p>
<h3>Check the question</h3>
<p>As above, repeat the question, paraphrasing it, and also give indication of 
your assumed context. Then ask if you have understood the question correctly.</p>
<h3>Test understanding</h3>
<p>When you give an answer, it is a good idea to check that they have understood 
what you said and that it sufficiently answers their question (most people will 
say yes anyway). If it does not, have another go. If they still do not get it 
then do not persist -- suggest they come and talk with you afterwards.</p>
<h3>Handling the persistent</h3>
<p>If people keep trying to talk with you, for example disagreeing with what you 
say or asking additional questions, you might want to allow one response but 
then need to move on. If you have a host then you may look to them before 
handling it yourself. The simplest method is to thank them for their questions 
and then, without giving a break in which they can talk ask for the next 
question. </p>
<p>In this, do try to understand the person's motive: are they being awkward or 
do they have a real question. Suggesting they come to see you afterwards will 
sort out the genuine questioner from those with ulterior motives. </p>
<p>If you are in a sales situation or similar context where it is more 
appropriate to continue to answer questions then of course you should so do, 
though you can also turn this into a conversation.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Handling the aggressive</h3>
<p>Sometimes you may face questioners who disagree with you sufficiently to be 
aggressive in their response. Never get drawn into a fight as this is what they 
may be seeking. Be polite but quietly
<a href="../../assertiveness/assertiveness.htm">assertive</a>.</p>
<p>One way of handling such people is simply not to respond. Let them exhaust 
themselves then move on. If they become physical, move away and try to put a 
barrier such as a table between you. </p>
<h2><a name="eff"></a>Effective answers</h2>
<p>When you come to answer questions you have been asked, if you do not have the 
right words to hand, do <a href="../../language/persuasive/pauses.htm">pause</a> 
to think what to say. This also has the benefit of showing you are taking the 
question seriously. </p>
<p>There are several ways you can answer the question:</p>
<h3>Answer just the question</h3>
<p>The simplest approach is just to answer the question you have been asked. 
Keep the answer clear and concise. Do not stray beyond the basic answer.</p>
<p>This method is a minimum basic and is a safe option when you are not sure 
about your audience.</p>
<h3>Expand on the topic</h3>
<p>If you are confident about the topic, if you have time and perhaps if the 
situation is less formal, then you can talk more broadly, reaching into new 
areas and introducing new topics.</p>
<p>This approach can help enrich your presentation, customising it for you 
audience and leaving them with a sense of having gained something extra from 
you.</p>
<h3>A brief, impromptu speech</h3>
<p>A clever way to answer questions is by giving a 'mini-speech', complete with 
introduction, body and conclusion. Delivering a response in this way gives a 
complete package that can make your answer coherent, whole and satisfying.</p>
<h3>When you do not know the answer</h3>
<p>If you do not know the answer, then do not try to bluster and fake an 
authoritative answer. One way of handling this is to bounce it back to the 
audience, asking what they think about the question and seeking their help in 
developing a good answer. This method cannot be used with all questions of 
course, but it can be a life-saver when you are stuck.</p>
<p>Another, simpler approach is simply to say that it is a good answer but you 
cannot do it justice here. You can, if appropriate, promise to research further 
and come back with an answer at a later date.</p>
<h3>Answer with a question</h3>
<p>Another way of dealing with tricky questions is to as a question in return. 
This can be used to help clarify what the questioner is really asking and what 
they are seeking. It may sometimes be appropriate to ask them what they think 
the answer is, though this can get you into trouble if not handled well.</p>
