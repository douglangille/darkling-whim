<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before you start it can be a good idea to check out the room to ensure 
everything you need is available. </p>
<p>A good rule of thumb if you are doing something like training is to arrive an 
hour or two early to ensure you can check it all out. </p>

<h2><a name="pen"></a>Pens, paper, etc.</h2>

<h3>Enough pens that work</h3>

<p>There is nothing worse for a presenter than to pick up the pen at the 
flipchart and find that it runs out in seconds flat. The response of most 
presenters is to put the pen neatly down in the same place and pick up another, 
thus repeating the problem for the next presenter.</p>

<p>Check out all flipchart and white-board pens beforehand. Use one full page 
and do a good scribble with all pens, and throw away those that are not up to 
the job.</p>

<p>A good selection of colors for pens is helpful -- red, green, blue and black 
being the minimum normal set. Professional presenters also bring their own -- 
hotels and office rooms are just too unreliable.</p>

<h3>Enough flip-chart paper</h3>

<p>Check that the flipcharts (if you are using them) have enough paper for your 
use. If necessary, have a new pad at hand. If you are going to draw on the 
walls, you can tape up the paper beforehand.</p>

<h3>For delegates, too</h3>

<p>Ensure there are pens and paper for delegates. In hotels, they often provide 
this. In the workplace, a few spare pens and a pile of paper is always a good 
idea. Also ensure you have enough photocopies of handouts, stapled or clipped 
together.</p>

<h2><a name="fur"></a>Furniture</h2>
<h3>Delegate furniture</h3>
<p>Delegates will need to sit and probably have a table on which to put their 
things. Consider carefully the <a href="room_layout.htm">seating layout</a> you 
need and ensure there are enough seats.</p>
<p>There are two situations to avoid. One is not enough seats for everyone and 
the other is lots more seats than delegates. It is often best to have a few 
seats spare so people can choose their place, although it can be a neat trick to 
have just too <i>few </i>seats so latecomers have to stand or scramble for 
additional seating (and so making your talk seem all the more popular).</p>
<h3>Speaker furniture</h3>
<p>Speakers may need tables on which to place water and materials (often best at their 
side). If there is a speaker panel, they may well need to sit down at a table.</p>
<p>Although speakers often stand behind tables or lecterns, it is better for 
connecting with the audience if there are no barriers between.</p>
<h2><a name="ele"></a>Electronic kit</h2>

<p>Most modern presentations make heavy use of technology, and if you are doing 
so then ensure your kit is ready. There is little worse way of starting a 
presentation than fumbling with projectors, computers, etc.</p>

<p>It is generally a good idea to have the name and number of phone the techie 
folks to hand who can come and help with disasters.</p>

<h3>Projectors</h3>

<p>Test the projector beforehand. Ensure you know what all the buttons do (well, 
at least those you will need). Know at least how to turn it on and focus it. 
With a PC projector, you should also be able to adjust trapezoidal shape and 
know how to plug it into your PC.</p>

<p>Projectors also need screens that are large enough and located so everyone 
can see. At worst, get a tripod stand-alone screen in, along with the projector.</p>

<p>Projectors used to be big and heavy, but they are now small enough to bring 
along with you. Many professional presenters bring their own projectors, not 
only because they know how to use them, but also because they can be confident 
that bright and accurate colors will be presented.</p>

<p>Ensure the projector gives a large enough picture that is bright enough and 
high enough for the people at the back to be able to see the projections clearly.</p>

<h3>Computers</h3>

<p>If you are not using your own computer, ensure the computer being used has 
got your presentation on it (the version that you want to use, of course). Email 
it to the organizer beforehand or bring it on a disk or memory stick.</p>

<p>Fire up the whole show before you get going, just to check that everything is 
in order and that you can get from zero to presenting without hassle.</p>

<h3>Anything else?</h3>

<p>Also consider any other electronica that you will need. Memory sticks? 
Phones? Mice?</p>

<p>If you are going to use a mouse to run the show, a long lead is helpful. You 
can get USB extensions, for example. You can also get hand-held roller-ball mice 
to make your presentation even slicker. Best is a radio-operated mouse so you 
can walk around and invisibly change slides at will.</p>

<h2><a name="wal"></a>Walls</h2>

<p>Look at the walls in the presentation room. What do you need about them?</p>

<h3>Poster space</h3>

<p>If you are going to pin things up on the wall, check that there is space to 
do so. Also check with the room owner whether you are allowed to stick things 
there. Even 'wall safe' adhesives and tape are banned from many places. Other 
rooms may have textured wall areas to which it is not that easy to stick things.</p>

<p>One of the heartaches of presenters is arriving with an armful of posters and 
nowhere to show them. The same principle applied when you want to pin flipchart 
pages on the wall.</p>

<p>One solution is to ask the room owner for pinboards. Not everyone has these, 
but they can help. Another is to have lots of flipchart stands. You can also be 
creative about where you stick things. Pictures, windows and doors often have 
glass areas to which you can safely attach your paper pages.</p>

<h3>Distractions</h3>

<p>Also look at the walls for distractions. Pictures and especially noticeboards 
can distract your audience, particularly when they are next to where you will 
present. Remove all of these if at all possible.</p>

<h2><a name="lig"></a>Lighting</h2>

<p>It is always a good idea to know where the light switches are, and which 
switch 
controls which light. If in doubt, use some bits of masking tape to label the 
switches beforehand.</p>

<h3>Front of the room</h3>

<p>You will probably be standing at the front of the room, where your 
presentation will take place. There are often conflicting needs here. You may 
want people to see flipcharts, etc. and so need good lighting. You may also want 
the lights turned down so they can better see projected images.</p>

<h3>Rest of the room</h3>

<p>Again, a dilemma can appear here. You may want to darken the room so the 
front of the room and the projections stand out, yet you may also want light so 
people can see to write or talk with one another as you need. The compromise is 
the same -- make sure you know where the light switch is and be ready to use it 
quickly. You can also have someone else standing near the switches where a 
signal from you can result in light or darkness. Best case is a dimmer that 
reduces light to an appropriate level.</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>Windows present interesting problems. They offer natural light and help to 
relax people. On the other hand, they let outside sounds in, are a source of 
distraction and their light cannot be easily turned off with a switch. Even with 
blinds or curtains, light is still likely to leak in. They also take up space 
that you might want for posting up information.</p>

<p>Windows near the front are more distracting and allow through light that 
may spoil the stage area. These may best be covered up from start to finish. Further back, 
they may be covered up for the duration of your presentation.
<a href="../../conversion/isolation.htm">Isolating</a> people from the world allows 
you to talk directly to them without reminders of external realities.</p>

<p>Drawing curtains at the end can be useful symbolism, reminding people that 
they are now back in the real world where they must implement the ideas you have 
given them. </p>

<h2><a name="cli"></a>Climate</h2>

<h3>Temperature</h3>

<p>Get the temperature of the room right. Too cold and people will shiver. Too 
hot and they will sweat. Either way, they will pay less attention to you.</p>

<p>Another temperature problem is that people are themselves radiators, creating 
heat. You can start with a cold room full of people, and in half an hour it can 
get uncomfortably hot. So ensure you have the means of controlling the 
temperature and that such methods can cope with significant temperature change.</p>

<h3>Humidity</h3>

<p>Humidity is sometimes important. It also is increased by people, who breath 
out moisture. As appropriate, check that climate control equipment can handle 
the expected humidity.</p>

<h3>Air</h3>

<p>We all need a plentiful supply of air. Unfortunately, in confined spaces, a 
group of people will tend to suck a lot of the oxygen from the air, making good 
ventilation important. If you cannot guarantee it, then plan to have lots of 
breaks. Big fans are also helpful for increasing circulation.</p>

<p>Windows also can be opened, providing both oxygen and normalization with 
outside temperature and humidity. When you are in a place where there is a good 
outside climate, opening the window can literally bring a breath of fresh air to 
the proceedings.</p>
