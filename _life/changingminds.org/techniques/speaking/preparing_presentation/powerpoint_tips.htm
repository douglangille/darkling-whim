<p>Here are a whole lot of tips and ideas to help you create a more powerful, 
persuasive presentation. </p>
<p>Ideally a slide is instantly understandable and your audience should not have 
to watch and wonder (if they do, they will not be listening to you).</p>
<h2><a name="col"></a>Using color</h2>
<p>Color can enliven presentations, highlighting key points and differentiating 
between different items. On the other hand, color can confuse.</p>
<p>The key is to use color for specific purpose. Red and yellow bring things 
forwards and blue and purple send them backwards, so use red, orange and yellow 
to highlight. Background colors should reinforce the foreground, not compete 
with it.</p>
<p>Colors can merge and contrast. Blue text on a green background can be very 
difficult to read. On the other hand, a single red word in an otherwise black and white 
slide will leap forward. Avoid too many colors as this is more likely to cause 
confusion.</p>
<p>Items which are related, but spread around the slide can be linked by 
painting them in the same color.</p>
<p>Colors also have
<a href="../../../disciplines/communication/color_effect.htm">cultural meaning</a>: 
Red means danger, yellow means cowardice, etc. Be careful with this, for example 
white signifies purity in many cultures, but also indicates death in others.</p>
<h2><a name="tit"></a>Slide titles</h2>
<p>Slide titles are often the largest text on the slide and are often boring and 
difficult to understand. It is better to use them like newspaper headlines where 
you can get the main meaning of the slide just by reading the title.</p>
<p>For some reason, some slides have huge title text that overshadows the main 
slide content. Try reducing the title size to increase imp</p>
<p>It can be effective to make slide titles impactful and meaningful rather than 
using them as a flag. For example, rather than having 'Strategic Implications' 
try something like 'If we don't change, we'll die'.</p>
<p>It can sometimes work to have a sequence of slides with titles that combine 
to form sentences and a story. For example </p>
<ul>
	<li>'We had a big meeting...'</li>
	<li>'And we decided to change...'</li>
	<li>'And we saved a lot of money...'</li>
	<li>'Whilst doubling sales!'</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="tex"></a>Use of text</h2>
<p>When you put text on a slide, people will try to read it (and in doing so 
will not be listening to you), so avoid a lot of text. </p>
<p>If the text is too small, your audience will again be unhappy. It should be 
clearly read from the back of the room. If you do not know the size of the room, 
assume it is large.</p>
<p>Keep the wording of text simple and in clear language, unless you are certain 
you are addressing experts who will expect jargon. Use unambiguous short phrases 
and sentences that each make a single, clear point.</p>
<p>When a sentence wraps across more than one lines, it increases the cognitive 
effort in reading it. This can be eased by keeping complete phrases on one line. 
The reader will pause when they move to a new line, so try to arrange the text 
with this natural cognitive break.</p>
<p>Put space between bullet points or paragraphs so each stands on its own 
without merging into a larger block of text. </p>
<h2><a name="bul"></a>Using bullet points</h2>
<p>Bullet points are common on slides and are a very useful tool. They help you 
keep the text short and separate different points.</p>
<p>Do not over-do bullet points. A common wisdom is to have no more than three 
to five bullet points per page. Also try to keep the text from one bullet point 
on one line as wrapping text significantly increases the effort required to read 
it.</p>
<h2><a name="spa"></a>Using space</h2>
<p>Space separates. It turns a single amorphous mass into individual elements 
that stand on their own. In reverse, less space between things joins, indicating 
association between things. Space also relaxes, letting the eye rest between 
things.</p>
<p>Separate out individual chunks that you will talk about individually. Put 
space between paragraphs and bullet points. And generally do not over-crowd 
slides. Less is often more in the way that </p>
<h2><a name="dat"></a>Data and charts</h2>
<p>Numeric data is always good for persuasion, but too much just turns into a 
mass of numbers. Data can be brought to life with the use of graphs and charts 
that help the viewer to make sense of it.</p>
<p>When creating graphs, consider the following points:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Lines which cross can indicate significant points. Too many crossed 
	lines rapidly creates confusion.</li>
	<li>Too many lines leads to confusion as the viewers try to follow different 
	lines.</li>
	<li>Using different colors for different lines helps.</li>
	<li>Make points, lines thick enough to be seen at the back of the room.</li>
	<li>Use shaded areas as a metaphor for size. Lots of one color means 'big!'</li>
	<li>Use the metaphor of color carefully, so red may mean bad and green may 
	mean good.</li>
	<li>Link similar items with similar colors.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="dia"></a>Using diagrams and images</h2>
<p>Endless text can be boring, and slides with diagrams that illustrate your 
meaning or a photo of the subject-matter can be helpful in bringing 
presentations to life. </p>
<p>Some people use only visuals and no words, which can be very impactful if you 
can pull it off. It is common, however to balance images, diagrams and words to let your audience 
see your key points 
whilst also sustaining their interest.</p>
<h2><a name="dec"></a>Decorations and embellishments</h2>
<p>Should you use 'prettification', with such as borders, backgrounds and little 
cartoon figures?</p>
<p>This can be a very audience-dependent subject. A little embellishment can 
make slides more attractive, though it is easy to over-do this, trivializing 
your subject and distracting viewers. Many business audiences do not like 
decoration, though creative groups may appreciate the art. Social groups may 
seek entertainment and cartoons could be fun for them. </p>
<p>Be careful about backgrounds and they can make the main text or diagrams 
harder to read. If you do use them, make them very indistinct, almost like a 
watermark.</p>
<h2><a name="ani"></a>Animation and transitions</h2>
<p>Powerpoint allows you to make the objects on slides appear in all sorts of 
ways and also to transition from one page to the next decoratively.</p>
<p>There is much debate about using these, but the best rule is the 'visual aid' 
principle: Use animations to make things easier for your audience. Making things 
just instantly 'appear' can confuse as people may miss it, so some movement is 
useful for catching the eye.</p>
<p>A big benefit is that animation helps the 'reading the text' problem. You can 
add text to a slide as you are making the point, hence limiting what the 
audience can read. A good way of introducing this is with a 'wipe' rather than 
the default 'fly in', as it is more subtle but still provides eye-catching 
movement. Wipes also work well with lines and arrows as you can make it appear 
as if the item is being 'drawn'.</p>
<p>For photographs and big items, movement would be alarming and a 'dissolve' 
often works best. For smaller object, use emphasis suited to the purpose. An 
important item, for example could do a 'zoom'. </p>
<p>Keep extreme animations to the minimum for more impact and less irritation. 
One place to use them is to introduce critical items as they provide additional 
emphasis. A time you can 'go mad' is when you want to add some humor.</p>
<h2><a name="sho"></a>Showing slides</h2>
<p>A cardinal rule is that your slides should support your talk and not the 
other way around. They should enhance your talk. They should not prop it up. 
Slides are sometimes called presentational aids, which can be confusing as they 
should be there to help the audience, not just you.</p>
<p>The worst use of slides is simply to show them and read the text out to the 
audience, which is something of an insult as it implies you are not really 
prepared. Another point that is often forgotten is that slides should appear 
when they are needed and disappear when they are no longer needed. If you are 
going to talk for any period beyond the point where the slide is helpful to the 
audience, then it should be removed. A simple trick in Powerpoint is to hit the 
'B' key, which blanks the screen. Another method is to put black slides in 
between slides that are used to support particular points. When there are things 
on the screen, the audience will look at them. When there is nothing, they will 
look at you, which is a good thing when you need them to pay attention.</p>
