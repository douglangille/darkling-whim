<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are three ways to persuade people as you seek to get them to do what you want 
them to do. These are very different both in method and in the effect they have.</p>
<h2><a name="cont"></a>Control</h2>
<h3>What</h3>
<p>Gaining control over a person is like having them as a puppet. Of course it 
is not that simple but the principle remains that you are seeking to control 
their actions without worrying too much about what they think.</p>
<h3>How</h3>
<p>To gain control of another person, so they do what you want even if they do 
not want to do it, you need <a href="../../../explanations/power/power.htm">
power</a>. This can be the power of authority, such as when a manager directs a 
subordinate. It can also be the power of money or knowing a person's secrets or 
other levers of direct influence.
</p>
<p>Another way is to use persuasive methods that
<a href="../../../principles/distraction.htm">distract</a> the conscious mind 
while you make suggestions to the unconscious.
<a href="../../../explanations/behaviors/conditioning/conditioning.htm">
Conditioning</a> is a further method that focuses on the unconscious mind and can 
work on humans as well as animals.</p>
<h3>Problems</h3>
<p>The problem with control is that we are an intelligent species and we do not 
stop thinking when people are trying to control us. In fact we tend to think 
even harder as we figure out what is going on and what to do about it.</p>
<p>We have a need for a <a href="../../../explanations/needs/control.htm">
sense of control</a> and when we realize others are trying to control us we will 
often become annoyed and <a href="../../resisting/resisting.htm">resist</a> 
their efforts, fighting back or taking sly revenge. This makes persuasion by 
control hazardous and best used only when the other methods are impractical.</p>
<h2><a name="convi"></a>Convince</h2>
<h3>What</h3>
<p>Convincing people seeks to gain their agreement, getting them to think about 
what is being said and concluding that it both makes sense and is the best 
option for them.</p>
<p>When people agree, they will act in aligned ways that seem sensible. They 
need less ongoing management and will effort to sustain their agreement.</p>
<h3>How</h3>
<p>To convince someone, you need to get their 
<a href="../../../principles/attention.htm">attention</a> so they will listen. 
Then you need to create a convincing
<a href="../../../disciplines/argument/argument.htm">argument</a> that presents 
your case and negates alternative views. You want them to think and agree, 
typically so they will act on this appreciation into the future rather than 
just taking immediate action (which is where Control focuses).</p>
<p>To convince, you need to show that your argument makes sense, with 
appropriate logic and
<a href="../../../disciplines/argument/types_reasoning/cause-and-effect.htm">
cause-and-effect</a> explanation. An argument also becomes more convincing when 
the person sees how it affects them personally, impacting their
<a href="../../../explanations/needs/needs.htm">needs</a> and
<a href="../../../explanations/motivation/goals.htm">goals</a>.</p>
<p>Gaining conviction often makes significant use of <a href="../../language/language.htm">
language</a>, and care with words is needed. The ancient Greeks were masters of
<a href="../../../disciplines/argument/five_canons/five_canons.htm">rhetoric</a>, 
and their methods can still be seen today in courtrooms and other formal 
contexts.</p>
<p>While sales people use some tricky methods, they also seek to convince, 
particularly when dealing with business and other repeat customers who may think 
later about how they were persuaded.</p>
<h3>Problems</h3>
<p>Convincing people is much harder work than the simple application of control. 
You need to think about how other people think and, to some extent, be a 
psychologist as well as a linguist and logician. </p>
<p>Even though convincing can work well, it may well not be enough. The 
confounding factor that stymies the logician is
<a href="../../../explanations/emotions/emotions.htm">emotion</a>. When we are 
emotional, we think less, and when we are highly emotional we almost completely 
lose our rationality.</p>
<h2><a name="conv"></a>Convert</h2>
<h3>What</h3>
<p>Conversion seeks to change a person's
<a href="../../../explanations/belief/belief.htm">beliefs</a> and
<a href="../../../explanations/values/values.htm">values</a>, getting them to 
truly buy into what is being suggested so they connect
<a href="../../../explanations/emotions/emotions.htm">emotionally</a> and even 
change their sense of <a href="../../../explanations/identity/identity.htm">
identity</a>.</p>
<h3>How</h3>
<p>Conversion often uses more emotion-based methods than the cooler logic of 
trying to convince people. </p>
<p>The emotional aspect of conversion means it is a more social activity and 
finding ways of <a href="../../../principles/bonding.htm">bonding</a> with the 
target person can be very helpful. Building
<a href="../../conversation/rapport/rapport.htm">rapport</a> is a classic way of 
doing this.</p>
<p>Natural methods such as
<a href="../../../disciplines/storytelling/storytelling.htm">storytelling</a> 
seek to get people to connect with idealized characters in the tale. These can 
be woven into <a href="../../conversation/conversation.htm">conversation</a> or 
used as stand-alone teaching tales.</p>
<p>Some <a href="../../conversion/cults.htm">cults</a> use aggressive
<a href="../../conversion/conversion.htm">conversion </a>methods such as
<a href="../../conversion/isolation.htm">isolation</a> and
<a href="../../conversion/breaking_sessions.htm">breaking sessions</a> to
<a href="../../conversion/identity_destruction.htm">destroy</a> and rebuild the 
person. Other ways include <a href="../../conversion/engagement.htm">engagement</a> 
and <a href="../../conversion/striving.htm">striving</a>. While cult methods 
seem harsh, more civilized versions of their methods may be seen in more 
traditional religions and businesses. </p>
<p>When a person's beliefs come from another person or source, you may want to 
undermine the source rather than the belief. Show the source as lacking 
credibility, with a shaky foundation.</p>
<h3>Problems</h3>
<p>Converting can be both easier and harder than convincing. People often hold 
their beliefs and values tightly and do not change easily. On the other hand, we 
may be converted by emotional appeals that do not need complex reasoning.</p>
<p>To change what a person <a href="../../../explanations/belief/belief.htm">
believes</a> is particularly difficult when they hold strongly to that belief 
and when it is associated with other beliefs, such that attacking a single 
belief is to attack the whole system. This is what happens when one aspect of a 
region is criticized.</p>
<p>Studies of cults have shown that even though they can cause a person to adopt 
very different beliefs, these effects fade when they leave the sustaining cult 
environment. What we believe is closely related to what people around us 
believe.</p>
<h2><a name="dis"></a>Discussion</h2>
<p>Control is probably the most common persuasive method used (think parents, 
managers, military), though it is the least 
effective in changing minds. This is probably because, if you have the power 
needed, it is quickest and easiest. Convincing and converting require more 
skill, which relatively few people have.</p>
<p>These are equivalent to another triple: The Three H's, or Head, Hands and 
Heart. Control directs the hands, getting people to do things without worrying 
about what they think. Convincing engages the head, asking them to think and 
agree. Conversion goes for the heart, seeking emotional buy-in.</p>

<p>If you wanted to be cynical, you could call these 'the three cons'. In 
practice, they are a very real choice and understanding the distinction can be 
critical.</p>
