<h2><a name="des"></a>Description</h2>
<p>This is the argumentum ad verecundiam. It consists in making an appeal to 
authority rather than reason, and in using such an authority as may suit the 
degree of knowledge possessed by your opponent.</p>
<p>Every man prefers belief to the exercise of judgment, says Seneca; and it is 
therefore an easy matter if you have an authority on your side which your 
opponent respects. The more limited his capacity and knowledge, the greater is 
the number of the authorities who weigh with him. But if his capacity and 
knowledge are of a high order, there are very few; indeed, hardly any at all. He 
may, perhaps, admit the authority of professional men versed in a science or an 
art or a handicraft of which he knows little or nothing; but even so he will 
regard it with suspicion. Contrarily, ordinary folk have a deep respect for 
professional men of every kind. They are unaware that a man who makes a 
profession of a thing loves it not for the thing itself, but for the money he 
makes by it; or that it is rare for a man who teaches to know his subject 
thoroughly; for if he studies it as he ought, he has in most cases no time left 
in which to teach it.<br>
But there are very many authorities who find respect with the mob, and if you 
have none that is quite suitable, you can take one that appears to be so; you 
may quote what some said in another sense or in other circumstances. Authorities 
which your opponent fails to understand are those of which he generally thinks 
the most. The unlearned entertain a peculiar respect for a Greek or a Latin 
flourish.</p>
<p>You may also, should it be necessary, not only twist your authorities, but 
actually falsify them, or quote something which you have invented entirely 
yourself. As a rule, your opponent has no books at hand, and could not use them 
if he had. The finest illustration of this is furnished by the French curé, who, 
to avoid being compelled, like other citizens, to pave the street in front of 
his house, quoted a saying which he described as biblical: paveant illi, ego non 
pavebo. That was quite enough for the municipal officers.</p>
<p>A universal prejudice may also be used as an authority; for most people think 
with Aristotle that that may be said to exist which many believe. There is no 
opinion, however absurd, which men will not readily embrace as soon as they can 
be brought to the conviction that it is generally adopted. Example affects their 
thought, just as it affects their action. They are like sheep following the 
bell-wether just as he leads them. They would sooner die than think. It is very 
curious that the universality of an opinion should have so much weight with 
people, as their own experience might tell them that its acceptance is an 
entirely thoughtless and merely imitative process. But it tells them nothing of 
the kind, because they possess no self-knowledge whatever. It is only the elect 
who say with Plato tois pollois polla dokei; which means that the public has a 
good many bees in its bonnet, and that it would be a long business to get at 
them.</p>
<p>But to speak seriously, the universality of an opinion is no proof, nay, it 
is not even a probability, that the opinion is right. Those who maintain that it 
is so must assume (1) that length of time deprives a universal opinion of its 
demonstrative force, as otherwise all the old errors which were once universally 
held to be true would have to be recalled; for instance, the Ptolemaic system 
would have to be restored, or Catholicism re-established in all Protestant 
countries. They must assume (2) that distance of space has the same effect; 
otherwise the respective universality of opinion among the adherents of 
Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam will put them in a difficulty.</p>
<p>When we come to look into the matter, so-called universal opinion is the 
opinion of two or three persons; and we should be persuaded of this if we could 
see the way in which it really arises.<br>
We should find that it is two or three persons who, in the first instance, 
accepted it, or advanced and maintained it; and of whom people were so good as 
to believe that they had thoroughly tested it. Then a few other persons, 
persuaded beforehand that the first were men of the requisite capacity, also 
accepted the opinion. These, again, were trusted by many others, whose laziness 
suggested to them that it was better to believe at once, than to go through the 
troublesome task of testing the matter for themselves. Thus the number of these 
lazy and credulous adherents grew from day to day; for the opinion had no sooner 
obtained a fair measure of support than its further supporters attributed this 
to the fact that the opinion could only have obtained it by the cogency of its 
arguments. The remainder were then compelled to grant what was universally 
granted, so as not to pass for unruly persons who resisted opinions which every 
one accepted, or pert fellows who thought themselves cleverer than any one else.</p>
<p>When opinion reaches this stage, adhesion becomes a duty; and henceforward 
the few who are capable of forming a judgment hold their peace. Those who 
venture to speak are such as are entirely incapable of forming any opinions or 
any judgment of their own, being merely the echo of others' opinions; and, 
nevertheless, they defend them with all the greater zeal and intolerance. For 
what they hate in people who think differently is not so much the different 
opinions which they profess, as the presumption of wanting to form their own 
judgment; a presumption of which they themselves are never guilty, as they are 
very well aware. In short, there are very few who can think, but every man wants 
to have an opinion; and what remains but to take it ready-made from others, 
instead of forming opinions for himself?</p>
<p>Since this is what happens, where is the value of the opinion even of a 
hundred millions? It is no more established than an historical fact reported by 
a hundred chroniclers who can be proved to have plagiarised it from one another; 
the opinion in the end being traceable to a single individual. It is all what I 
say, what you say, and, finally, what he says; and the whole of it is nothing 
but a series of assertions: -</p>
<p class="quote">Dico ego, tu dicis, sed denique dixit et ille;<br>
Dictaque post toties, nil nisi dicta vides.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in a dispute with ordinary people, we may employ universal 
opinion as an authority. For it will generally be found that when two of them 
are fighting, that is the weapon which both of them choose as a means of attack. 
If a man of the better sort has to deal with them, it is most advisable for him 
to condescend to the use of this weapon too, and to select such authorities as 
will make an impression on his opponent's weak side. For, ex hypothesi, he is as 
insensible to all rational argument as a horny-hided Siegfried, dipped in the 
flood of incapacity, and unable to think or judge.</p>
<p>Before a tribunal the dispute is one between authorities alone, - such 
authoritative statements, I mean, as are laid down by legal experts; and here 
the exercise of judgment consists in discovering what law or authority applies 
to the case in question. There is, however, plenty of room for Dialectic; for 
should the case in question and the law not really fit each other, they can, if 
necessary, be twisted until they appear to do so, or vice versa.</p>
<h2><a name="exa"></a>Example</h2>
<p class="quote"><i>Well I happen to have my lawyer in the other room. Let's ask 
him if it's legal.</i></p>
<p class="quote"><i>Yes, but Festinger pointed out (in 1956, I believe) that 
such actions can be explained by cognitive dissonance.</i></p>
<p class="quote"><i>By what authority do you say that? You may not have 
realized, but I have a doctorate in the subject, so please don't mess with me 
about it.</i></p>
<h2><a name="dis"></a>Discussion</h2>

<p>If the other person is a clear expert in the area you are discussing, then 
they may assert their expertise and unless you have an even greater expertise to 
hand you may be in difficultly. But this is not that common and unless you can 
claim unchallengeable expertise then there is scope for referring to a third 
party expert.</p>
<p>The perfect solution with a third party is to have an unchallengeable 
<a href="../../../principles/authority.htm">authority</a> on hand who can step in and assert truth. This is not always 
possible, but 
having anybody reasonably intelligent to back up your assertions may yet be 
sufficient. Another form of referring to authority is via written text, 
particularly by an accepted authority or source. This is why academic arguments 
put great store in articles from peer-reviewed journals.</p>
<p>Authority can also be established socially -- if ten people agree on 
something, then the eleventh </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Argumentum ad verecundiam</i> means &quot;arguing from authority.&quot;</p>
<p><i>Paveant illi, ego non pavebo</i> literally means 'to dread in that, I do 
not dread', but is used here in wit to say 'I do not pave'.</p>
<p><i>Dico ego, tu dicis, sed denique dixit et ille; dictaque post toties, nil 
nisi dicta vides</i>. means &quot;It is all what I say, what you say, and, finally, 
what he says; and the whole of it is nothing but a series of assertions.&quot;</p>
<p>'Appeal to Authority Rather Than Reason' is the thirtieth of Schopenhauer's stratagems.</p>
