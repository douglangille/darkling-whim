<p>Pictures and images are often used in advertising and other persuasive 
situations. Beyond just showing the product, they can have other specific 
persuasive messages.</p>
<h2><a name="sho"></a>Showing the product</h2>
<p>The most basic promotion is simply to show the product, making it clear 
what you are promoting. If your customer is not sure what you are selling, this 
will make it clear.</p>
<p>The secret of success with product images is the same as with any image: 
emotional appeal. If your product is desirable, then simply showing an appealing 
picture of it may suffice. Food and high-tech companies both use this principle. 
</p>
<p>The risk in simple product shots is that customers are not excited and 
quickly move on, or think 'so what'. It does not matter if your products excite 
<i>you</i>, which they probably do. It is the majority of viewing customers who really 
count.</p>
<h2><a name="bra"></a>Brand-alignment</h2>
<p>An important part of using images in advertising and company literature is 
ensuring the picture matches the brand of the product and the organization.</p>
<p>Hence, for example, if the brand value of a detergent is 'soft' then softened 
photography of people with soft clothing may help. A brand value of 'innovative' 
may be highlighted with unusual and surprising images. A brand value of 'leading 
edge' may be reflected in views of high technology contexts, young people being 
dynamic, active marketplaces and so on.</p>
<h2><a name="ill"></a>Illustrating action </h2>
<p>People don't always understand what you are selling, what it is really for or 
how to use it to best effect. Pictures can show this, saying 'here's how to do 
it' or 'look, it's easy.'</p>
<p>Even if it is obvious, when you show the product being used, you make it 
easier for people to imagine themselves using it in the same way as they are
<a href="../../../explanations/critical_theory/concepts/interpellation.htm">
interpellated</a> into the position of the person in the picture. </p>
<h2><a name="tel"></a>Telling a story</h2>
<p><a href="../../../disciplines/storytelling/storytelling.htm">Stories</a> help 
us create <a href="../../../explanations/meaning/meaning.htm">meaning</a> in the 
way they narrate a sequential reality that aligns with the linear nature of 
conscious thought. In the manner that we make stories of our lives as we live each 
moment and day, we can likewise make sense of stories that unfold in the same 
way. </p>
<p>Stories can remind us of things that have already happened to us or that we 
would like to happen. They can awaken inner fears and desires in a style that flat 
description cannot approach.</p>
<p>Images can tell stories, even when they are static photographs or drawings. 
In fact many of the best pictures are great because of the stories they tell. A 
person looking out of a window with a dreamy expression tells a story of wishes 
or fond memories. A group of friends laughing over a beer reminds us of our own 
friends and how good they make us feel as we relax with them.</p>
<h2><a name="bea"></a>Beautiful people</h2>
<p>Few adverts use pictures of ordinary people in ordinary clothing. We are 
constantly faced with 'shiny, happy people' who beautifully smile at us and 
always look great, whatever they are selling.</p>
<p>A reason for this is that when we see images of people, we may be pulled into 
the image or project ourselves into it or see it as a kind of mirror as we
<a href="../../../explanations/identity/identity.htm">identify</a> with the 
people there. We can only sustain this if we find that identification pleasant 
and harmonious, otherwise we push it away, distancing ourselves from the 
unpleasantness. </p>
<p>In this way, the most successful images are those of people who we think we 
would like or who we would like to be. </p>
<p>This only backfires if we feel that we are being manipulated or have such a 
poor self-image we cannot identify with the models used. This is one reason why 
adverts that use 'ordinary' people can effect a reversal that harmonizes with 
cynics, snagging them as they push away from more conventional images. Knowing 
your audience is the secret of success and not-beautiful people can work if this 
knowledge is used correctly.</p>
<p>There has been much criticism of the use of beauty in advertising in the way 
that it creates dissatisfaction and unhappiness where people believe they must 
be as attractive as the people shown (Richins 1991). </p>
<p>In response to this, more 'ordinary' people are seen now. This can be 
successful when viewers find it easier to associate with those who seem more 
like them than like their aspirations.</p>
<h2><a name="fac"></a>Facial attraction</h2>
<p>No matter whether the person in the photo is beautiful or not, we are 
programmed to look at faces, scanning them for familiarity, threat or 
opportunity. </p>
<p>Faces hence have an attentive power all of their own. It is amazing what we 
can determine from a face, recognizing complex emotions and noticing how it 
responds to what we say and do.</p>
<p>The mathematics of attractive faces, defined by various ratios and 
dimensions, is quite precise. A 'wide-eyed' face, for example, can cause 
pleasure or repulsion, with only fractions separating the two.</p>
<p>The faces of babies and children are designed by nature to be attractive to 
adults, softening hearts and melting any aggression.</p>
<p>Pictures that are mostly face make us think about the person and their 
character. We hence easily relate to them. When more of the body is shown, the 
face becomes smaller and we look more at what they are wearing or doing, as well 
as the other things around them.</p>
<h2><a name="pow"></a>The power of eyes</h2>
<p>Melanie Bateson and colleagues famously found in 2006 that putting a picture 
of a pair of eyes above a coffee pot in a university staff room significantly 
increased the takings in the honesty box. They tried different eyes and found 
that the most effective eyes were direct and staring.</p>
<p>Dan Ariely has noted that most of us cheat, just a bit, although we still 
like to think of ourselves as honest (and most certainly want others to think 
this). So when we believe we are being watched, we are more honest. The Bateson 
experiment highlights how this is so deeply ingrained we are even persuaded by a 
pair of eyes.</p>
<p>Historical people knew this too, and the 'evil eye' and protective eye 
symbols have been used for many, many years. Even the James Bond '007' moniker 
originated with the '00' as a pair of eyes, with the magical number 7 to protect 
them.</p>
<p>We also follow the gaze of people in pictures, wondering what they are 
looking at. Hence if a number of people are shown, looking at your product, then 
viewers will also end up staring at the product too.</p>
<h2 align="left"><a name="nic"></a>Nice scenery</h2>
<p align="left">Another image that people often respond well to is the great 
outdoors. Pictures of trees, mountains, lakes and meadows make us feel good, 
which is why so many adverts use such images as backdrops, even when the product 
has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p align="left">Nature can also be abstractly included with potted plants in 
inside scenes or even general green hues across a picture. The warm glow of the 
sun or sunsets can alternatively be portrayed with red or orange hues. </p>
