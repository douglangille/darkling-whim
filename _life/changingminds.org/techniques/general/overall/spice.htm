<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dutton (2010) identifies five common patterns in persuasive methods that he 
fits to the word SPICE: <a href="#sim">Simplicity</a>, <a href="#per">Perceived self-interest</a>, 
<a href="#inc">Incongruity</a>, 
<a href="#con">Confidence</a> and <a href="#emp">Empathy</a>. </p>
<p>Here's a discussion of each of these:</p>
<h2><a name="sim"></a>Simplicity</h2>
<p>It is not what you say, it is how you say it. And the simpler the better. 
People understand simple. The more complex the wording, the more misunderstanding (and 
non-understanding) there will be. </p>
<p>When you want to get across a subtle message, you can use simple headlines to
<a href="../../../principles/distraction.htm">distract</a> or cloak the inner 
persuasion. If you 
want somebody to <a href="../../memory/memory.htm">remember</a> something, make 
it simple. And if you want to hammer home a point, say things in
<a href="../repetition/triple.htm">threes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../repetition/repetition.htm">Repetition</a> and other patterns are 
all about simplifying. Acronyms do the same -- this page uses 'SPICE' to help 
get the message across and memorable. And there are many
<a href="../../language/figures_speech/figures_speech.htm">figures of speech</a> 
that use simplicity in subtle ways. Brevity helps too. Less is more.</p>
<p>Watch people when they are trying to persuade others. They may start complex 
but, faced with confusion, their message gets simpler and simpler. Politicians 
and journalists know this already and use headlines to quickly get the message 
across.</p>
<p>Complexity has its place too. In the
<a href="../../../principles/confusion.htm">confusion principle</a>, you occupy 
the mind in trying to work something out whilst you slip past with the real 
message. Paradoxically, the complexity method is quite simple.</p>
<h2><a name="per"></a>Perceived self-interest</h2>
<p>Although we are social animals, we are ultimately self-interested. The whole 
realm of Game Theory use classic experiments like the Prisoner's Dilemma to test 
(and, sadly, prove) our ultimate selfishness. Faced with the threat of others 
taking advantage of us, we are easily tempted to get in first.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It can be argued that even altruism is designed to make us feel good as we 
help others. When they feel good, our 
<a href="../../../explanations/emotions/empathy.htm">empathy</a> makes us feel good, and so this is 
our ultimate aim.</p>
<p>An important point is that self-interest is about 
<a href="../../../explanations/perception/perception.htm">perception</a>. People do 
things that they <i>think </i>are in their own interest. So if you can convince 
other people that an idea is good for them, then they will likely go along with 
it, whether or not this is true. </p>
<p>In this way, you can play to self-interest when influencing and persuading. When 
working with a new boss, for example, a useful approach is to say 'My job is to make <i>you
</i>successful'. Find out what their boss wants and deliver it, making sure that 
your boss looks good. Of course you can gain some glory too, but beware of 
grabbing the limelight from the person who is effectively your personal 
employer.</p>
<p>When designing your persuasive message and action, always remember WIIFM and 
WAMI, a pair of thoughts that we all regularly have. WIIFM stands for 'What's In 
It For Me'. And WAMI is the other side of the same coin: 'What's Against My 
Interests'. This is not all we think and we may not noticing ourselves doing it, 
but the thoughts are often in there somewhere.</p>
<p>A complexity here is that when you are doing the persuading, you are also 
thinking WIIFM and WAMI. And, just as you are thinking about the other person's 
WIIFM and WAMI, they are quite possible thinking the same about you, too. </p>
<h2><a name="inc"></a>Incongruity</h2>
<p>Congruent shapes are those that are identical in all respects. Incongruous 
ones do not fit together. When perceiving our personal universe, we seek 
patterns that we recognize. Patterns are
<a href="../../../explanations/needs/safety.htm">safe</a> and
<a href="../../../explanations/needs/prediction.htm">predictable</a>, and our 
brains reward us by making us feel good when we recognize their
<a href="../../../principles/harmony.htm">harmony</a>. The flip side of this is 
that we feel uncomfortable when we cannot fit things into our patterns. </p>
<p>When things are not as they 'should' be, we become
<a href="../../../principles/confusion.htm">confused</a>. We fall into the
<a href="../../../explanations/brain/fight_flight.htm">fight-or-flight reaction</a> 
or otherwise resort to
<a href="../../../explanations/behaviors/coping/coping.htm">coping</a>. We
<a href="../../../explanations/theories/satisficing.htm">satisfice</a>, seeking 
any solution, including self-deception, to resolve our discomfort. We will see 
what we want to see rather than what is actually there. </p>
<p>In trying to figure out what is happening, we may well pay a lot of attention 
to the incongruity, which means we will miss all kinds of other things going on. 
We also may ignore the incongruity completely as we are unable to process it. In a classic 
experiment, a group of students were shown video of people playing basketball 
and were asked to count the number of bounces of the ball. Most of them 
completely missed a person in a gorilla suit dancing through the scene!</p>
<p>In persuasion, this means the confused person will grasp at straws, including 
the solutions you offer. They will pay attention to incongruity and miss things 
you want them to miss. You may also succeed in getting them to ignore the 
blatantly obvious if it is outrageously odd, especially if it is not where they 
are currently paying attention.</p>
<h2><a name="con"></a>Confidence</h2>
<p>Confidence will cover a lot of sins. If you are as bold as brass and speak 
like you know what you are saying, then it is amazing what you can get away 
with.</p>
<p>Confidence tricksters know this as they confidently play roles and purloin 
your goods. Actors know it too, as do leaders in all walks of life. Be
<a href="../../assertiveness/assertiveness.htm">assertive</a>. Act big and 
people will assume you are big. This is one trick that shorter people may learn 
as they compensate for their physical lack of advantage.</p>
<p>This appears in the <a href="../../../principles/authority.htm">authority 
principle</a>, where even the symbols of power are accepted as showing that you 
must be obeyed. In the famous Milgram experiments, about 65% people off the 
streets were persuaded to administer 'lethal' doses of electricity to strangers, 
only because they were told to do so by a man in a white coat. When trappings of 
authority, such as the 'supervisor' not wearing the white coat, the conforming 
number dropped to around 25%.</p>
<h2><a name="emp"></a>Empathy</h2>
<p>Humans have <a href="../../../explanations/evolution/evolution.htm">evolved</a> 
as a tribal species. Living together is good for survival, although this means 
we must <a href="../../../explanations/trust/trust.htm">trust</a> others, which 
in turn means we need to have some idea of how they think and feel.
<a href="../../../explanations/emotions/empathy.htm">Empathy</a> is 'feeling 
what others feel' and leads to caring for them.
<a href="../../conversation/rapport/active_care.htm">Care</a> is a key aspect of 
trust (I will trust those who care about me). In this way, showing empathy gains 
trust which increases your chance of persuading. It also helps, of course, to 
know something of what the other person is feeling.</p>
<p>A classic way of connecting with people is by
<a href="../../conversation/rapport/rapport.htm">building rapport</a> through 
methods such as demonstrating <a href="../../../principles/similarity.htm">
similarity</a> and relevance to the other person.</p>
<p>All this is deeply embedded in our psyches. We all have a powerful need for a 
sense of <a href="../../../explanations/needs/identity.htm">identity</a>, much 
of which we get through our interactions with other people as we socially 
construct out selves. A critical social process here is
<a href="../../../principles/bonding.htm">bonding</a> with others, which is 
effectively a joining of identities. When we 'become one' our fates are 
synonymous and when you ask me to do something it is like me asking myself.</p>
