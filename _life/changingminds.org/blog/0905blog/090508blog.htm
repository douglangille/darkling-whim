<p><i>Friday 08-May-09</i><h2>Extremist persuasion</h2>
<p>How do extremist political groups persuade? The answer would seem to be quite 
cleverly, if they are to get their message accepted, although some groups do 
seem to erroneously think that turning up the loudness is.a good alternative.
</p>
<p>Researchers Finlay and Wood analysed communications from the right-wing 
British Nationalist Party after the '7/7' bombings in London in July 2005. 
Extreme events tend to provoke and polarise extreme views, and groups such as 
the BNP will milk them for all the converts they can get. </p>
<p>Finlay and Wood identify two principles used: the &quot;accentuation effect&quot;, and 
&quot;essentialism&quot;. </p>
<p>'Accentuation' <a href="../../principles/amplification.htm">amplifies</a> 
us-and-them differences, making the out-group far more different from the 
in-group than they really are. When you exaggerate, you polarize people, 
creating a false <a href="../../principles/contrast.htm">contrast</a> and 
forcing an alternative choice between the us and 'them'. </p>
<p>'Essentialism' enhances this process and perception by taking a single 
undesirable character and putting it at the core of the target group. This 
generalises people so you can say 'they're all like that'. </p>
<p>Another trick is to reframe a negative as a positive, such as 'Yes, we may be 
politically incorrect, but at least we tell the truth.' Note here how racist 
bias is weakened to an untruthful 'political correctness' then reframed as the 
higher-integrity value of honesty. </p>
<p>In a neat reversal, they also redirect labels applied to them to their 
opponents, accusing liberals and Muslims as being fascists. They also re-use 
emotive labels, calling others Nazis (using accentuation and essentialism to 
justify this). </p>
<p>Obscure scholarly references are used to add apparent credibility. Arcane and 
even biblical references are used to hook religious readers and extend 
significance. </p>
<p>The problem of extremist groups leveraging troubles does not go away. Even as 
I write this I just heard a government minister expressing concern that right 
wing groups may stir up racism as jobs disappear. </p>
<p>As with all political messages, the important thing is to see through the 
rhetoric and persuasive devices to the actual intent beneath. When this seeks to 
create social division and consequent unrest, it makes sense that while the 
message may be of academic interest, its substance should be carefully avoided.
</p>

</u>Wood, C. and Finlay, W. M. L. (2008). British National Party representations 
of Muslims in the month after the London bombings: Homogeneity, threat, and the 
conspiracy tradition. British Journal of Social Psychology, 47 (4), 707-726.</p>

<h2 align="center">Your comments</h2>
<hr color="#808080">
<p>Many of these devices will not work with educated, intelligent or well read 
persons. However such groups need such members for credibility.<br>
<br>
The tactic often appears to be that the extreme traits are only for the rank and 
file and that any that see through the rhetoric are invited to an elite wing.<br>
<br>
I thought that I remember scanning microfilm of a 1933 newspaper. Hitler had 
just been positioned as either as Chancellor or president of the Reichstag.<br>
<br>
Albert Einstein, who had dual Prussian and Swiss citizenship was out of the 
country at the time and was contemplating whether or not to return.<br>
<br>
A group identified as the &quot;British Fascist Association&quot; (or something akin to 
that) invited him to England. &quot;....come into my parlour, said the spider to the 
fly.....&quot;<br>
<br>
He apparently thought better.... <br>
<br>
-- Peter</p>
<p><i><br>
<b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Certainly, it makes sense that thoughtful people less likely to be taken in 
by crass persuasive methods and extremists may well not notice this in their 
crafty delight. Maybe also they are not seeking to persuade those who would 
think and challenge -- better to turn the masses against the intelligentsia, 
which has been done in such as Stalin's Russia. </i></p>
<p><i>Yet also I am perplexed to discover that cults often recruit from 
universities and value people who can persuasively promote the cause. It seems 
there is a style of intelligence that seeks certainty without question. In 
academia it can be about becoming an authority on other authorities (like being 
a Shakespeare expert). In religion it is about knowing the religious texts. In 
politics, extremists quote Marx and Mao. If such people jump, they do so hook, 
line and sinker.</i></p>
<p><i>People coming out of cults describe the affair as a 'temporary insanity'.&nbsp; 
After the 2nd World War many ex-Nazi's felt a deep and perplexed shame for what 
they had supported. In war, soldiers commit atrocities that come back to haunt 
them. It is scary how easily we can be persuaded to do things we would never 
have thought we would do.&nbsp; </i></p>
<hr color="#808080">

<p>Question was why intelligent people fall for extremist groups. <br>
<br>
I think one has to distinguish here between 3 groups.<br>
- Believers<br>
- Purpose-seekers<br>
- Opportunists<br>
<br>
I take the example of Nazi Germany.<br>
<br>
Believers:<br>
What most people just fail to get is that at the time now almost universally 
accepted &quot;beliefs&quot; where not that &quot;scientifically&quot; clear as now.<br>
- Biology was not as advanced as now and it was just not clear if there was 
something to racial supremacy theory or not<br>
- In terms of economic success it was still not clear at the time if a 
collectivist system (Soviet, Nazi, Mao China whatever) or an individualist 
system is more powerful, successful, productive<br>
- There was much less information out there so conspiracy theories were much 
easier for people to belief than now. (Example: Theory of Jews being behind 
communism as well as capitalism) What that means: Some people truly believed in 
the different ideas of the ideology. Partly because the theories had not been 
falsified already.<br>
<br>
Purpose-seekers:<br>
Like the example Dave gave, people who just want to have something they can 
believe in and fight for. This might include some longing for a collectivist 
identity. The less mainstream the better. These people can be quiet intelligent. 
Example: Goebbels who came from a religious family and was looking out for a new 
creed.<br>
<br>
Opportunists:<br>
Pretty easy. If an extremist party seems to offer the fulfillment of motivations 
like making a career some people unscrupulously jump on that. Example: People 
joining the SS because it is where you can go ahead. <br>
<br>
The question why people now still join extremist concepts that have 
historically/empirically been falsified is however a bit more difficult to 
answer.<br>
I guess background is either deep rooted prejudices/stupidness or extreme 
individualism (you defend something really non-mainstream (pretty much like 
&quot;extremists&quot; libertarians)<br>
<br>
<br>
-- Bastian B</p>
<p><i><br>
<b>Dave replies:</b><br>
Good classification, Bastion, with helpful examples. It is common to find 
'purpose seekers'&nbsp; amongst students, which is one reason many groups go 
recruiting there, from traditional religions to cults to political parties. 
Extremists and moderates plough the same furrow here.</i></p>
