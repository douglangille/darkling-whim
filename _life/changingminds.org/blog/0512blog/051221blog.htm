<h2>How to lose an election</h2>

<p>Here in the UK, the Conservative opposition recently changed its 
leader--again.</p>

<p>The hapless Michael Howard lost the election last Spring for the 
Conservatives and threw in the towel. Now it's the turn of fresh-faced David 
Cameron.</p>

<p>The key event for me was a televised 'meet the public' show, where all three 
political leaders faced a melting pot of the electorate who asked some pretty 
searching questions.</p>

<p>The question of Iraq came up with great regularity. When asked why he took 
the country into an unpopular war, Tony Blair just said 'I made the best 
decision I could at the time, given the information I had.'</p>

<p>Neat answer! He shows himself as a decisive 
<a href="../../disciplines/leadership/leadership.htm">leader</a>, able to make difficult 
choices, whilst at the same time appealing to the doubters by inferring that he 
was always seeking to avoid war.</p>

<p>When Michael Howard was asked if he would have made the same decision, he of 
course said yes. To say no would be to display weakness. Then came the killer 
question. If you knew that there were no weapons of mass destruction, would you 
still have gone to war?</p>

<p>This is what is called a '<a href="../../techniques/questioning/double_bind.htm">double 
bind</a>': you are damned whether you say yes or 
no. Michael Howard, already in the 'don't appear weak' mindset said 'yes'. The 
questioner, incredulous, asked the question twice again, 'Are you sure?' 
Trapped, Howard could only say yes, although by now he looked far from sure as 
he dug himself deeper into the mire.</p>

<p>And so, for me, he lost the election. Tony Blair was firm and clear. Michael 
Howard looked like an uncertain and weak man who just says what he thinks wants 
to be heard.</p>

<p>And now it's David Cameron's turn. Can he whip the Conservatives into shape? 
For nearly ten years they have lost their way in internal squabbles that led to 
compromise leaders who could not cut the mustard. Only time will tell.</p><hr>
