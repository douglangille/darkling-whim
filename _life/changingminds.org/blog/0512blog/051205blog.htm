<h2>Friends in need, real friends and fairweather friends</h2>

<p>'<a href="http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/a-friend-in-need.html">A friend in need is a friend indeed</a>' is a popular saying, implying that 
some people play the friendship card when they need something from you. Whilst this can indeed 
be true, the reverse is also significant. When you are in need, then you find 
out who are your real friends.</p>

<p>An acquaintance found out recently that she has a chronic medical condition. 
Nothing visible and nothing to stop her living a normal life, but something that 
will occasionally flare up and cause discomfort. She also found out something of 
the difference between real and fairweather friends.</p>

<p>She informed them simply because she is an open and honest person. There was 
no seeking of particular help. Perhaps a little sympathy, but no special 
treatment or additional attention.</p>

<p>When she told some friends, they responded with concern. They listened 
without asking anything in return. They asked how they could help. These were 
real friends.</p>

<p>Others, who she also believed to be friends of the same sort, responded first 
with selfish concerns. They asked if it was infectious in any way or that might 
somehow catch it. Then they melted away, despite reassurance of their safety. </p>

<p>Fairweather friends are those who are most likely to appear when they are in 
need or, at best, when you are not in need. Real friends don't care about your 
need. They will help where they can and know that it's ok if they can only offer 
a little sympathy. </p>

<p>This must be something like what it is to have cancer, HIV or AIDS. Those who 
were friends when all was well suddenly show their true colors, whilst some from 
the core and some from the periphery fly the true flag of 
<a href="../../explanations/theories/a_friendship.htm">friendship</a>, offering 
and giving what help they can.</p>

<p class="MsoPlainText">The third wheel. The tag-along. The last in the priority 
list friend. I had been through all of these, even up until now with friends 
whom I thought were real. I am still hoping they are or if not, they'll change 
'cause my friendship with them weren't all that bad. However, I really felt to 
be invisible in our group. That they only contact me when they needed something 
and would be out of the blue thereafter. They also aren't listening to me 
sincerely after asking me what I've been up to lately. Jokes at me when 
sometimes it looked like they're bullying me. Mostly, they are all self-centered, 
needy, competitive, yet genuinely caring. I don't know now if they're still like 
that. Seemed not. I did the gentle fade a couple of times yet I ended up guilty 
doing it so I reconcile with them again when they establish a reconnection. 
Crazy. For all I know, I don't feel connected with them anymore. We shared a 
long history, but the friendship felt dead to me. I am longing for the 
connection I once felt with them, that's why I managed to survive being the 
third wheel, the tag-along, and the fall back friend for them. Think I am having 
enough. I am sad thinking about this&nbsp; over and over.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;-- Jinnie</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;Yeah, well, I'm in here waiting for their needs, with my anon quote, 
&quot;Best friends are like diamonds, precious and rare. False friends are like 
leaves, found everywhere.&quot; Trouble is, all I seem to have around me is false 
friends. 1I have been out of town for over 2 months. Seems now that I have 
returned, everyone has moved on and/or afraid of abandonment. It was the same 
cold shoulder I got where I was visiting -everyone there on vacation or braced 
for rejection in a transient tourist world. Wish I could accept my loner 
reality, in motion, not sure where to settle. <br>
<br>
-- leaf</p>
<p><i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>I have few good friends and many acquaintances. I was certainly a loner in 
high school and only made good friends&nbsp; when I went to University. Others 
find their way in different ways. Key is to ask yourself difficult questions and 
reply honestly, without beating up on yourself. We're all human and fallible. 
Then actively get into self-development, ditching any self-pity, self-loathing, 
etc. And first you won't mind not having friends. Then, oddly, when you don't 
need them, they will appear.</i></p>

<p>Good for a teenager to read. For a middle-aged adult with a chronic disabling 
medical conditions, not too in depth.<br>
A good start. <br>

<p>I am a girl and I want be a friend for a boy but I want just friendship <br>
<br>
-- Lina<br>
<br>
<i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>You and many, many other girls, Lina (including my daughter). It's a sad 
fact that many boys find this difficult. There are those out there, however, who 
can be 'just friends'. The problem is that they may not want to stay that way. 
Fewer still can do this properly.&nbsp; One way that this does happen is where 
the boy is gay. This may seem strange, but gay guys make great friends with 
girls as neither will want any more than friendship.</i></p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;I've found out the real meaning to fake friends and real friends. Real 
friends are <i>always</i> there for you no matter what fake friends are people 
who just talk to you when they have no one else to talk too.<br>
<br>
Am I right?<br>
<br>
~Mary <br>
<br>
<i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>That's a pretty good definition, Mary. There are some shades of gray also 
between real and fake friends --- for example many intermediate friends will be 
there for you </i>sometimes<i>. But the best of friends are, indeed, there for 
you through thick and thin. Also remember that friendship is a reciprocal 
arrangement, and you also need to be there for them too.&nbsp; </i></p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;Most of my friends disappear when I am in need of them, however when 
they need me. I always offer them hand whether emotionally or financially. when 
things are good for me they tend to call me or gather around me. what shall I do? will 
I cut them off or keep helping them no matter what they do to me.<br>
<br>
abdi </p>
<p><b><i>Dave replies</i>:<br>
</b><i>These sounds like fairweather friends, Abdi.&nbsp; My advice would be 
that after you have offered a certain level of support to a friend that if they 
do not reciprocate on the same level, that you do not offer the higher level of 
support again. If you like, give them one more chance, but do not keep doing 
this in the vain hope that they will one day improve. You don't need to cut them 
off, but it does make sense to downgrade those who do not reciprocate at the 
same level from 'close friends' to 'acquaintances' with whom you spend some 
time. There are other people like you out there, believe me, who will 
reciprocate at the same level as you, but do not waste time on those who do not 
want this level of supportive friendship.</i></p>

<hr>

<p>I have friends I don't knew if they are real... I got 1 close friend, he is 
the only closest friend in my whole life that is why I can say that he is my 
best friend. But I cant tell if he treat me as a best friend as well. Every time 
he is in needs he contacts me and I'm always there. Does it mean that I''m 
already his best friend? Am wondering if he only uses me and needs me when he is 
in need. But when not. he don't even give me a call or even say hi and hello. 
this bothers me a lot. <br>
<br>
-- jing nea<br>
<br>
<i><b>Dave replies:</b><br>
It sounds like for him you're a good friend, but I don't know if you're his best 
friend or if he has a best friend (I have friends but no best friend). 
Friendship is about giving and getting in some format that works for you. It can 
also mean letting them go their own way. If you ask too much of a friend (as </i>
they<i> define it) they may distance themselves from you more. We all have need 
for contact but some people have more need than others. I have friends I see 
every few years and that is just fine.&nbsp; It takes two to be friends and each 
may have a different idea of what that friendship should be like, which can be 
difficult but it doesn't mean they cannot be friends.</i></p>
<hr>

<p>&nbsp;I have a friend who I think just uses me alot. He comes around when his 
mom grounds him or punishes him, or when they don't have alot of food or his 
'favorite' food, He comes over whenever I get new games for playstation, and he 
swears alot. he wants me to swear too, but I don't feel right when I swear. I'm 
thinking he's not a good friend to be around, I don't even feel that safe around 
him because he got suspended for having a knife at school. What should I do? <br>
<br>
-- Kathryn<br>
<br>
<i><b>Dave replies:</b><br>
Kathryn, I think you're right. It looks like he's using you. I'd make excuses 
and refuse. Be out when he calls. Just say no.</i></p>
<hr>

<p>&quot;Dave's reply to Lina:<br>
You and many, many other girls, Lina (including my daughter). It's a sad fact 
that many boys find this difficult. There are those out there, however, who can 
be 'just friends'. The problem is that they may not want to stay that way. Fewer 
still can do this properly. One way that this does happen is where the boy is 
gay. This may seem strange, but gay guys make great friends with girls as 
neither will want any more than friendship.&quot;<br>
<br>
I take offense to this. My group of friends is about evenly matched as far as 
gender goes, and one of the 2 vary close friends I have is a girl. While I'll 
admit that I have had a lot of luck with friends (almost all my friends have 
stood by me no matter what happened. And considering how annoying I can get, 
that's pity hard) I still can't see a friendship between a boy and a girl to be 
particularly hard to maintain as just a friendship (Although this may be just my 
opinion...).</p>
<p>-- Yuriy (a guy in high school.)<br>
<br>
<i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>You are right, Yuriy, that guys can have female friends who are just friends 
and I've a few myself. It's just that there's a lot of misunderstanding out 
there about what people want from a relationship and it's easy to confuse 'just 
friends' and 'romantic relationships'. Before I was married I fell into the trap 
a few times with girls who wanted to be friends and I wanted more. Since 
marriage and with a bit more learning I've had a number of women send romantic 
signals when I am just being friendly (I know the dangers here and do not play 
away).</i></p>
<hr>

<p>I agree with the confusion signals you talk about between friends of the 
other sex. I am married and I have had friends say that I'm being romantic when 
actually I thought I was being friendly. In fact my best friend started falling 
for my husband in much this same way. Do you have any advice for figuring out 
how to tell the difference between flirty, teasing friendly and playful 
friendship? <br>
<br>
-- Jada<br>
<br>
<i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Hmm. Tricky. One method I'd use is to talk about my partner and watch the 
response. If they are happy with you talking about your other half, it's 
friendly. If they look miffed and back off, then it's probably not.</i></p>
<hr>

<p>In fact i'm moroccan male . I think the real friendship is't to help your 
friend and share him his all problems .and help him. and considered him just 
like your self or more . so we have one life so we need to life it at peace and 
happyness <br>
<br>
-- man</p>
<hr>

<p>&nbsp;Well, uhm. It's summertime and only a COUPLE of my friends -- who 
seemed like my best friends in school, have talked to me. I send them comments 
saying &quot;Hi&quot; but they don't comment me back. Just their other friends. I've done 
nothing wrong what should I do? Do I not talk to them when school starts again? 
I'm really sad and upset that most of them are doing the same thing to me. <br>
<br>
-- lost and confused<br>
<br>
<i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Well first, you are not alone. This happens to many, many people. Don't 
assume you might have done something 'wrong' because usually, you haven't. The 
most common cause is that people have different friends in different places and 
times (they are thus 'situated'). Thus you may be seen as a good friend in 
school, but not outside or not in the summer. There are many other 
possibilities, from going on holiday to meeting other people.</i></p>
<p><i>When people who I thought were universal friends - that is friends at all 
time in all places - become reticent or difficult, then the first thing I do is 
back off a little. The last thing friends should do is chase after one another 
saying 'I want you to be my friend'. I then do little tests, like sending them a 
text and seeing if they reply, what they say, etc. This tells me whether they 
want to be universal or situated friends. </i></p>
<p><i>I have lots of situated friends and few universal friends, and I'm 
comfortable with this. If people want to be more friendly, then I also have to 
decide if that's what I want, so I do 'situating' too. What I've found is that 
when you offer accepting friendship and do not chase people, then more people 
will seek your company. I want friends to be comfortable with me and not feel 
obliged. If they want to go elsewhere, that's just fine and I don't feel bad 
about it. </i></p>
<hr>

<p>&nbsp;My name is joan chentu and I will like to have a friend. My father is a 
pastor and my mother is a house wife. If I am writing to you, is just that I need a friend .I need someone in whom 
I can true a friend who will always be 
there for me when I need help. this is why I am writing to you. <br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Friends are people we find, Joan. True friends do not appear immediately as 
we must first learn to trust one another.</i> <i>Friends may be there when you 
need help but you also need to be there when they need help. The best way to 
find friends is often not to look for them but simply to be a gentle friend to 
others. In order to receive, you must first give. There are many who need your 
friendship and support. Be that generous friend who seeks nothing in return but 
the satisfaction of seeing them smile and, when you least expect it, you will 
find you have more friends than you knew.</i></p>
<hr>

<p>I have many, many acquaintances, and I get on with a lot of people very well. 
A lot of them I don't tend to see outside of work. I grew apart from my close 
friends from school as we tend to do different things nowadays. I have a &quot;best 
mate&quot; who I'm still good mates with from school, who I go to gigs and events 
with (all the things my old school mates don't do) and go to the pub for a drink 
with regularly, he comes round my house and we watch TV, generally just having a 
laugh. But he has little &quot;digs&quot; at me, which sometimes gets me down. I know its 
only a bit of banter but a lot of my old friends do this as well. I've helped 
him out financially in the past and don't expect it in return as he isn't as 
well off as me. I haven't been going out a lot for the last month or so due to 
financial circumstances, and my &quot;best mate&quot; is concerned at this and seems to 
want me to go &quot;out on the town&quot;. Is this a real/best friend? <br>
<br>
-- Steve</p>
<p><i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Friendship is a complex affair -- the only real rule is 'what works for you 
both'. Friendships where one gains at the expense of another are dysfunctional. 
We use friends to define ourselves and when these people change, even for the 
better, we may become annoyed as this effectively changes our selves (and hence 
we may prod, provoke and otherwise try to get the original person back). </i>
</p>
<p><i>Banter can be really saying 'you're different -- I want the old you back'. 
Effectively it is trying to put you into the box where they feel most 
comfortable with you (although this is seldom a conscious activity).</i></p>
<p><i>Your best mate wanting you to go out on the town may be him trying to 
cheer you up in the way he would cheer himself up. When this conflicts with your 
need to conserve money, a good friend should really accept this. </i></p>
<p><i>The best friends accept you as you are, not as they want you to be.</i></p>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;I've been discouraged by people who I had considered to be a &quot;friend&quot;. 
I thought I had been fairly close to Sarah because of how frequently we saw each 
other during nursing school. Sarah was my maid of honor in December of last 
year. I flew her entire family in at our expense, bought her expensive jewelry 
and had several good conversations. While I don't think she is intentionally 
ignoring me, it will take many phonecalls on my end before I ever get her to 
call me just once. This is really hurtful. I am a loyal, loving-hearted, and 
giving person who has a wonderful husband and family. I would love to be a loyal 
friend to someone who would just make more of an effort to be a friend to me. 
Sometimes I wish I just had someone other than my husband to confide in. <br>
<br>
Sad and Disappointed--<br>
Sonia </p><hr>
<p>I have a friend name Tiana . Everyone thinks she's fake . I stood up for her 
because I didn't think that . We became good friends . She knows me pretty well 
and I know her pretty well now . I tell her everything and she tells me 
everything . Who I like and who she likes . She liked a guy named DJ and Ii did 
whatever to help her . She appreciated what I did for her and all . She then 
wanted to help me on my love life . She knew who I liked of course . She said 
she wanted to help me but then a couple days later she then liked the same guy I liked . 
I know feelings cant be help but she lied to me . She keeps giving me 
hope and stuff but at the same time she's crushing it . Tiana told me that it 
may just be a crush . I just don't know what to do now . I'm not disappointed or 
mad that she has a crush on the person I like but I'm more of a mad that she 
always lead people on in liking her but she says she would never like them back, 
I'm more disappointed and mad that she lied to me, trying to give me hope but 
backstabbing that when she turns around . Is she a true friend? What should I do? </p>
<p>Confused&amp;Quiet ;<br>
Natalie<br>
<br>
<i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Sometimes there are difficult decisions between friends and romance and it 
looks like Tiana has chosen romance. In doing so, she has forfeited your 
friendship. Is she a true friend? It doesn't look like it. I'd do one of two 
things: (a) dump her in the way she seems to be dumping the trust you placed in 
her, or (b) tell her how you feel, and if she does not come up with a really 
good answer, revert to (a).</i></p>
<hr>
<p>I have a friend for close to 20 yrs whose life has been very similar to mine. 
We are single moms of 1 son each which they are now grown young men. We have 
become even closer over the past several yrs and had become running buddies 
since we are obviously older and our circle of single friends has gotten 
smaller. </p>
<p>But, my friend has found a mate after all these years and I was really happy 
for her.. he is a doctor and they are getting married, but even though she 
assured that our friendship would not dissipate it has..in the past year we went 
from talking to each other daily and being involved in each other's life to now 
we may talk every few weeks for a few minutes. </p>
<p>I feel used and hurt because I know she hasn't abandoned another friend of 
hers that she has had even longer than me. I want to say something to her about 
how I feel, but then I think I shouldn't. I always thought the world of her, and 
wouldn't think that she would use anyone, but it is difficult not to think that 
she only used me because she needed a running buddy, after all we had been 
friends for so long. She has not reciprocated at the same level and our 
friendship is changing from 'close friends' to 'acquaintance', and at this late 
stage of life I am hurt since I thought we were lifelong friends and thought we 
would share in each other's lives even if we did find a mate. If I didn't know 
that she hasn't changed her relationship and closeness with her other lifelong 
friend I wouldn't feel used and hurt.. What do you think? <br>
</p>
<p>-- nak</p>
<p><i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>How you feel is quite understandable, Nak. When a long-term friend changes 
the status of your friendship of course it is going to hurt. The question is how 
you think about it and what you do about it.</i></p>
<p><i>A trap is to reframe the friend as bad. If you think them as bad you will 
act as if they are bad and effectively drive them further away. This is one 
option, of course and you can abandon them as they seem to have abandoned you. 
There are many lonely people in the world who would appreciate more some of your 
kind attention. </i></p>
<p><i>Another way of looking at it is as an episode in life. For a while, you 
gave each other succour and support, but now the situation has changed and your 
friendship must change too. Like a child who moves away and only calls their 
parents infrequently, sometimes people move on. The child may still love their 
parents but they no longer need them, perhaps because their parents have given 
them enough in many ways to enable the child to fly the coop into greater 
independence. </i></p>
<p><i>Her spending more time other friend is curious and perhaps reflects that 
the person is giving more to a specific need that you do not give. This is 
normal! We get different things from different friends. It is quite possible 
that what you gave in the past she now gets from her new partner.</i></p>
<p><i>My advice would be to find some quality time with your friend and discuss 
things openly and, very importantly, <u>without blame</u>. Listen to what each 
needs and accept that some of your needs that she fulfilled in the past now must 
be found elsewhere. Keep the love that is there and cherish what you gave each 
other for so many years.</i></p><hr>
<p>&nbsp;I recently moved back to my hometown in Georgia after 10 years of 
living in NYC. Of course I found myself isolated and lonely, missing the (what I thought to be) very important friendships 
I left up north. A month into being 
here, my mother suddenly &amp; unexpectedly passed away. I'm an only child &amp; we were 
extremely close, we battled and argued much like most mothers and daughters but 
we loved each other with such intensity. The most eye opening lesson I've 
learned from this experience was who turned out to be real friends. People I didn't consider my closest friends came out of the wood work to support me and 
offer an unconditional shoulder to cry on &amp; and ear for me to vent...however my 
best friend of 15 years neglected to call me after a few brief conversations the 
day of my mothers death. After over a month of waiting for her to call, I finally wrote her an email, asking her simply if 
I had done something to upset 
her, why I hadn't heard from her? Her reply was basically this:<br>
<br>
I love you, but I am focusing on &quot;my path, goals &amp; dreams&quot;. She wished me the 
best and said we will always be friends, then ended her simple email stating &quot;I 
just need my space right now&quot;<br>
<br>
Never in my life did I expect someone so close who I've spent half of my life 
with to do to me what I've seen her do to others time and time again, using her 
ambition as a barrier to caring for another. Undoubtedly I tell myself how sorry 
I feel for her that she is completely and totally incapable of sharing human 
qualities such as sympathy and compassion, but it still does not dull the pain 
of being left, asking for help and being denied even the simplest act of 
kindness. <br>
<br>
With that I will say I am so grateful for those people in my life who very much 
rallied around me and still, a month and a half later (and probably as long as 
it takes), continue to rally around me. True friends are indeed the most 
precious gift anyone can have, and I try as often as possible to let them know 
how grateful I am &amp; how much I love them. Lesson learned...<br>

<p>This is a good blog...<br>
it helps to reflect on my own behaviour and feelings about my friendships 
currently. I made a list of friends in good standing, fairweather, conditional 
and civil by association and luckily there are 10 in good standing. Man, though 
do I take my friendships seriously!!</p>
<p>It makes me laugh at myself how upset I can get thinking of a simple life 
fact like moving. Last week I had to clear out both my small cabins. The only 
person that showed up was my brother and my father had to tell him to go help 
me! I told most of my friends that I was moving but I did not ask anyone to help 
me move since I am always ready to help a friend if they say they are moving 
(w/o being asked first)... In fact I just received a thank you card from a 
friend I helped move a few months back saying she appreciated that I am always 
ready to help her. </p>
<p>Also, recently, a male friend gave me an ultimatum about our &quot;friendship&quot;. 
After many manipulative comments directed at controling our relationship into a 
romantic place, without success on his part, he said we couldn't hang out with 
our mutual friends together. Since he's the 'invite' guy, I've been iced out of 
social occasions with other 'situational', and 'civil' friends I enjoy. For a 
number of years now, all of the men have avoided much conversation with me, 
stepping aside for this 'friend'. Now, since I have sternly and w/o inhibition 
to hurting his feelings said no to his unrelentless motives he, under a guise of 
being godly, has asked his friends to pray for my problem with commitment with 
men. After telling me about this in our last conversation recently, I rebuked 
him saying that it isn't right to make up a problem about someone because your 
looking to justify why I do not reciprocate your feelings. Also, it appears that 
he is trying to hurt me back. It bothers me the most that all of these mutual 
friends are not supporting me since it should be obvious that I do not want him 
as a boyfriend. Especially to the other men in the group who should see after 5 
years that I do not like this man like that since we have never dated or alluded 
to dating. I don't appreciate being slandered either. Should I let it go?<br>
I don't understand their complacency.</p>
<p>That frustrates me. This 'friend' is very popular, likable guy and the ring 
leader of many old friends. I had fun getting to know them. Now I am sad that I am out of this group and don't feel that 
I did anything wrong. Lesson learned: 
Never fight with the most popular guy when you are moving. No one shows up. Or 
is it that they are simply not worthy of MY friendship. Because I give it. And I am not afraid to love people as best 
I can. I am glad I have other friends to 
talk to. But it remains hurtful to me. </p>
<p>I am taking a year sabbatical and this is a compelling way to move away from 
fairweather 'friends' who don't take a stand on what's right.</p>

</b>Some lessons of life are hard, and it's easy to become cynical. I find
<a href="../0804blog/080409blog.htm">words of wisdom</a> helpful sometimes here. 
Helpful also is to explain how you feel and why. It can be difficult but at 
least it clears the air and helps you decide what to do next, and stepping away 
from a friendship is always an option -- for a friendship to work it has to be 
right for both sides. What 'friendship' means to me may not be the same as what 
it means to you. Be careful, then, in imposing your values on others.</i></p>
<p><i>Indeed there's danger in criticising a group leader, for by doing so you 
are criticising the group. There are roles (such as the Shakesperian fool) in 
which this can be done, but it's a slippery path. Criticising the leader can 
also be seen as a challenge to his/her position, resulting in a fight of some 
kind.</i></p>

<p>I think real friendships are a rare occurrence on this side of eternity. 
There are many people who are there for you when times are good, but as times 
change, the cycle of time shows who is true and who is false. Also, to the 
comment about the girl who wanted to be friends w/ guys, they don't necessarily 
have to be gay Dave. I made good friends with boy guys and girls, because I am 
an understanding person. If the girl doesn't want to have a relationship or 
doesn't express interest, then I am not going to push it. Once in middle school, 
a friend girl of mine asked if I was, and I told her no. I actually kept hinting 
that I liked her, but she never caught on. Anyway, I just hung with some girls 
in middle school, cuz the guys ostracized me, because this one guy, who had 
status didn't like me. Aww well. <br>

<p>Hi everyone. I wanted to share a story but I am not sure if it fits the 
criteria for this blog. I have a friend called Milos. I met him at university 
and initially I found him to be easy to relate to, easygoing and fairly 
intelligent. There was something about him that made him endearing. First of 
all, like many people of his age, he was into independent bands, literature, and 
found most faddish trends off-putting. Of all the people in the class, I had the 
greatest contact with him, and at times it felt as if he was not interested in 
being at university or doing the course he was enrolled on. In fact, he told me 
when I first talked to him that the course did not interest him, but it was a 
way out of his rural life, and since he had some funding it meant he could live 
in the city. If he did not he would have had to return home. Maybe this isn't 
significant, but many things followed this pattern in his life. He would always 
have one reason for doing something which could quite easily be interpreted as 
something else. For instance, if he did not want to do something, he would 
always come up with another reason, yet in all discussions it would be clear 
that he really wasn't very eager to indulge in anything, yet he always expressed 
his commitment to things. However, not everyone noticed this since few people 
knew him as well as I did, and also, the real reason for his actions was seldom 
revealed but what he did to avoid a particular event (when I already knew he was 
not keen on participating), he would try to come up with something that would be 
least offensive and he did not have to say the truth. I will get back to this 
later. In this way, we always remained friends and we talked as often as we 
could. We corresponded and shared many ideas, but I always felt that usually 
when he wanted to see me, r personally get in touch with me was when he needed 
something. This was also true before. He would need someone to sign him into 
college classes and I thought he needed someone to keep him in touch with what 
was going on in the classes, but he did not do this as other people do since he 
was very well spoken, laid back and very pleasant and came across as being very 
sincere. People really found him to be quite honest and very likeable so even 
people with whom he spent very little time would vouch for his integrity since 
he had one public face, which masked his true motivations, which were never 
explicitly revealed but if one spent enough time with him, it became obvious 
that he was selfish, avoided everything, but he was also quite sly. If you don't 
say what you feel and instead say something else to the same effect which also 
happens to be true or realistic, he would go for it, cause little or no offence, 
and also get sympathy. After we left university, I was the only person he stayed 
in touch with. His parents lived in the countryside and at times he returned 
home, lived with his parents and then came back to the city for short stretches, 
sometimes living with friends (rent free), or claiming welfare whilst saying he 
had some mystery illness which never stopped him from going to pubs, hanging out 
with his other friends, playing videogames and illegally downloading media, and 
going to concerts and hanging out with his brother's university friends. What's 
so fairweather about that? I think he just lies, he jst doesn't say what he 
really thinks or feels. He only hangs out with people who may be of some use to 
him in the future. In the last few years whilst I have been studying, he has 
neither worked nor done anything, and in the last few months, he was diagnosed 
with an illness that is very vague and allows him to stay out of work. I know 
for a fact that he never wanted to work in his life, and he made this pretty 
clear, and he cannot commit to anything that requires commitment or punctuality 
other than those things that interest him (such as hanging out with his friends 
and being involved in their projects). However, he has the best of both worlds 
because he does not have to pay for his living costs (he lives rent free at a 
flat rented by his brother and university friends) and due to their affluence 
and ambitions, he is able to also involve himself in their activities, network 
with the group and raise his profile, and anything else he can't afford, he 
tries to take from the resources he could exploit. For instance, whenever he has 
wanted advice or something material from me, he has been in touch. We both have 
an interest in the arts, and I think there is some disagreement on the way we 
see things, and in spite of having very obvious differences, he would not openly 
say that he disagrees with me simply because if you believe something, you do 
not have to say it if it would likely cause a rift in the friendship because he 
needs me to help him. I know this. We have have become two very different people 
and everything I have said or done has indicated this yet for some reason the 
things I know he would not agree with he never seems to say because if he does, 
it would mean we would become incompatible and he would not be able to take 
advantage of what I have achieved in the last few years. So what have I achieved. As 
I said before, we are both interested in the arts, and although I have hardly distinguished myself in that field, 
I have worked in the arts 
industry for a very key organisations, and have some contacts there, and he 
probably thinks I may have some influence amongst the people I met there. Within 
my chosen field of interest I have also had contact with some significant 
figures and have been involved in working within the area from which he is 
excluded since he has little practical work experience, or educational 
qualifications. I have just invested a lot of time in this friendship, and some 
of his worst qualities, oblivious to others, have always been quite evident, but 
I have some fondness for opportunists and people who would like an easy life. I have no sense of morality myself, and, in his place 
I would have done the same, 
and lets not pretend that if we can get something out of life by manipulating 
the resources, we wouldn't feel good about it. It just doesn't feel very good 
when you think you are one of those resources, especially when, on your part the 
relationship was sincere, and that you genuinely admired the person. In recent 
months my life has seen some turmoil and in this time I hardly heard from him. I would email him a lot, and he would not even send a reply. would ask him 
questions, and he wouldn't have time of day for me, yet he was neither employed 
nor engaged with anything. He would always make up some excuse for not seeing me 
(I hardly ever see him anyway, as I have been working and he often leaves town 
when the flat he resides in is vacated by its official residents during semester 
breaks). Yet, whenever he needs something from me, he comes across as being 
awfully nice and he just doesn't seem to really listen to what I am saying. He 
just seems to agree with me without listening to the details, and once he's got 
what he needs he is never in touch again. Recently I got fed up and thought 
maybe I should just forget about him, and maybe should but then, he is such a 
person that if I do this he will get all the sympathy since everything he does 
is always justifiable and he is never blatant about using people since he puts 
them in a position where he neither demands anything nor does anything that 
would be offensive. I mean, if I ditch him, people will say I was the intolerant 
one, and if I say I was getting nothing from his friendship, people would still 
say I was the selfish one. I just feel really bad since I really believed in 
times of trouble maybe he would understand my concerns, but he does not seem to 
be responsive, which to me suggests he is not committed. He has not cut me off 
since he has suggested he would like to start some kind of enterprise and needs 
me to help him. In the meantime, he has been having fun with his real friends, 
with whom he lives and par takes in their life and activities. I just feel 
excluded because if I was a friend, he would have asked me to accompany him on 
some of the things he does. He would rather shut me out. Maybe some people think 
am romantically interested in this person. This is false, I am a heterosexual 
male, but I thought I had found a kindred spirit, but I am beginning to see that 
maybe I found a chameleon who changes colour to fit into any situation. It is 
just that to the discerning individual, he is not very convincing, but as most 
of the people he is in touch with are hardly going to consider his ulterior 
motives for being with them, he takes advantage of their trust. I am very upset 
since, as I said, I thought he was a friend, but I now know that he treats me or 
thinks of me as being someone he could use, and it hurts because nothing he has 
said or done could be sincere and if that is the case, I could never get the 
truth from someone like this. Friends need to be honest and critical too. They 
shouldn't agree with everything we say. What makes a debate interesting is when 
people debate and disagree. If the only person only ever agrees for fear of 
alienating or offend ing you, it is not a friendship. Is there anything anyone 
wants to say? </p>

I don't know what should I do! I always want to help my friends without thinking 
if that is good or bad for them! Whenever they are in trouble I cant just 
looking although I know that may be wrong. What should I do? I also have a 
friend that I consider the best, but it seem to be that it's so hard for him to 
listen to me! Whenever I'm sad or off I just want to share with him but he 
nearly can not understand! I always have to solve his problems. I don't know 
what to do as I make friend with so few people! I don't know if there's anyone 
for me to share! </p>

</b>Hi Tranvan. Sometimes people are not ready to listen and sometimes they are 
not ready to hear what you have to say. It's like with my teenage son: he often 
is not ready to listen to his father. So I back off, otherwise I would be 
talking for my own benefit. I look for times when he is more open, then I pick 
my words carefully and avoid over-doing it. Sometimes planting a few seeds is 
better than trying to grow the whole crop at once. The secret of friendship is 
often patience and understanding.</i></p>

<hr>
<p>&nbsp;Well I have this friend who, sometimes is there for me, but other 
times, like now for instance, completely ignores me. I help her out to. When she 
does his I usually try to give her space, but earlier today she told me, and I quote &quot;I'm busy. And 
I don't really care&quot; but only hours later she said I was 
overacting. what did I do to her?? its really hurting me. <br>

<p><i><b>Dave replies:</b><br>
Let her know that it hurt you, but -- and this is important -- do it in a way 
that is not accusing. Act as if she hadn't realized it hurt you. Don't back her 
into a corner where she feels she has to defend herself. Then listen. And then 
decide how much she really cares and how much of a friend she really is. Then 
decide what to say and do. </i></p>

<p>Hi, I have a kinda large group of friends at school (year nine) but there 
seems to be like a social hierarchy. Some people are liked much more than others 
and people are always looking to become friends with those who are higher up in 
the hierarchy. The problem is I don't really have any friends in this group and 
I am finding it difficult to make them because people are always looking to make 
friends with people who are generally liked more than themselves, and as I am 
low on this 'social hierarchy' I cant find any friends! Also, my group seems to 
be interested in video games quite a lot, but my parents don't let me play them, 
so I cant really join the conversations that they have at school about them. The 
only good thing is that I do have some people who like me outside of my group, 
but they are all in different groups to one another, and all of these other 
groups have at least one person in them who doesn't like me. I have looked at 
the opportunity of making friends with people who aren't really in a group 
(loners) but I don't really want to go down to that level. So what do I do? I don't really want to take the large risk of trying to change groups, because 
I might be rejected which will harm my future chances of finding a group and 
getting more friends. Ur blog is really useful, and thx for reading my post. </p>
<p>-- Harry</p>
<p><i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Hi Harry. Your situation is far more common than you might think. There's 
two things you can do: change yourself and change what you do. </i></p>
<p><i>Changing yourself means trying to see how others see you and find out why, 
then changing what you think. For example many people are less popular because 
they actually think about themselves too much (this can be hard to understand 
and accept). Some have problems because they believe that others are superior to 
them (or vice versa), rather than all people being equal. Making internal 
changes is tricky but it's the one thing you can control. Think hard and 
honestly about how you think. Listen to what you say to yourself.</i></p>
<p><i>Changing what you do can include not trying to hard. People who chase 
others too much end up with the others running away or pushing them away. Learn 
to be happy without others. Don't bother about this social hierarchy thing. It's 
a strange thing, but if you want friends less then you'll have more.</i></p>
<p><i>Hope this helps.</i></p>

<p>Well I use to belong to this church, the church is own and ran by family 
members. The pastor son would call me fairweather friend; I thought that being 
called a fairweather friend was a good thing until I was reading some of the 
comments prior to. I don't know why he calls me fairweather friend when I would 
give my last money I had in my pockets. I had to leave the church so I could 
learn how to grow in the knowledge and grace of talent that God had given me. I was tired of burying my talent. 
I come back at times to visit only when they 
have a need or they may need a little help in a certain area in the church. <br>

<p>&nbsp;I have always Tried my best to make people happy. I have a friend named 
john (this name is so common, I feel okay putting it) and he's always really 
been there for me when I need him. He isn't interested in anything more than 
friendship, and neither am I. He's having a hard time with a girl who he is in 
love with. She uses him. <br>
<br>
The strange thing about john is that he almost seems like a reverse fairweather 
friend. I texted him one time, and I told him I was crying. I didn't get a 
reply, until about 10 minutes later, and he said &quot;I'm outside, come here and 
give me a hug&quot; then we went for a drive and listened to a band we both really 
love. He accepts the fact that I don't like to talk about my problems, and can 
comfort me in different ways.<br>
<br>
He does stuff like this consistently, but when he's really upset, (usually about 
this evil girl he loves so much) he'll tell me about it, but all I can do is 
listen to him.<br>
<br>
He won't tell me in person, only texting or on msn, and he doesn't want anything 
more than acceptance, and I guess justification of his feelings.<br>
<br>
Am I still being a good friend? I try my best but I don't know how to make him 
happy. <br>

&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Hi Michelle. Friendship is about give and take in ways that work for both 
parties. There's few rules beyond this. Fairweather friends tend not to give 
what others need, which makes for a broken friendship. Sounds like you and John 
help one another when you're down, giving what the other needs (and not 
necessarily what you want to give). And just listening without comment or 
criticism is often what's needed. So I'd say you and John are both very good 
friends. </i></p>
<hr>

<p>Dear Dave, </p>
<p>I don't know what to do. I have a friendship of which I have maintained for 
the past year and some months now with a girl named &quot;K&quot;, but originally this 
friendship started off with us &quot;strongly disliking&quot; one another due to a guy we 
both &quot;wanted&quot; and several negative rumors that came afterwards. At the same time 
we both shared a common friend ?P?, that we perceived to be each our &quot;best 
friend&quot; and constantly, we kept her in the middle sometimes with our negative 
feelings towards one another. The problem I am facing now is still with my 
friend ?K?. She has been a very good friend to me in many ways listening, giving 
advice, supporting and encouraging me and I considered her to be my ?best 
female? friend (even though she was originally best friends with my other friend 
?P?).</p>
<p>Whenever she confronts me about a situation, she usually comes across as rude 
and has a slight attitude, and I am tired of all the arguments we have been 
getting into usually about the similar things. Even though she has her best 
interest at times for me, she is a stronger Christian than I am and has a way of 
CONSTANTLY ?picking? at things very petty such as the clothing I wear that 
sometimes that show very little of my cleavage (of which she comes across as 
nagging---and my own mother rarely does), making assumptions about my other 
close friendships (that she thinks we are not ?real? friends----although these 
friends of mine have been there for me in several positive ways and continue to 
play an important part in my life (and I believe that she crosses the line when 
she makes these remarks), and her expectance to know ?every little detail? about 
situations that are personal and I do not feel the need to explain everything to 
her, keep some privacy (although I trusted her the quickest out of all my 
friends). </p>
<p>All the situations along with the way she confronts me, I feel like she 
crosses the line with. Recently when I calmly tried talking to her about some of 
these things, she was rude told me and told me ?not to talk to her, she is done? 
which kinda hurt my feelings b/c it sounded like she was ?done? with our 
friendship. As I?ve had the time to reflect on our friendship, I feel like 
telling her how I feel (not to talk to me as if she is my mother and rudely in 
that manor) and ending our friendship (assuming we are still friends), b/c I?m 
tired of dealing with this situation constantly since our different views seem 
not to be changing that much. I know overall I will miss her presence in the end 
and that the friendship between myself, ?P? and ?K? might resume back to the way 
it was in the beginning with ?P? in the middle and ?K? and I avoiding each 
other. Is this the best thing for me to do b/c I have become fed up with the way 
she is towards me although she has been one of the ?best female? friends I could 
hope for despite how we started out. </p>

<p><i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Hello Pricilla. Friendships come and friendships go. It sounds like you had 
a good friendship here for a while but now it's on the wane. For a friendship to 
work, it must work for both parties, and this seems not be the case now. Do not 
fall into the blame trap -- it is seldom anyone's 'fault' -- it just happens, 
just as the seasons change. Some friendships go on for a long time and some are 
for a little while. It's probably a good idea to back off for a while. Go talk 
with others. Be civil when you meet, but do not expect anything from her.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;I was going through a personal crisis a few months ago, and not one of 
my friends came to visit me where I was living (which is approx 20 mins away 
from them). These are friendships from high school, and I am not 2 1/2 years or 
so graduated from college. I also know that they are gossiping and making fun of 
me behind my back. I'd rather be alone at this point. <br>

</b>Those who knew you in high school may seem different now and you may seem 
different to them. College changes how you think and equips you well for life. 
Those who have not shared this experience can be envious or have changed in 
their own way. Old friendships can be rebuilt but it's not the same because 
you're not the same people. Sounds like you're well off being away from them 
now. So put them behind you for now and go build a new social circle.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;I understand your frustration and support you in your decision. I lived 
most of my time living that way. Financially I was stable and everyone who came 
along including my family were somehow helped.3yrs ago my downfall started with 
my girlfriend who secretly was manipulated by her mother who was a con, left me. 
We agreed to relocate to Germany and she goes first to pave the way for us while 
I sort out things here. The truth was that her mother was in loads of debts and 
influenced her that her previous boss wants her back and that her father left us 
a small guest house for when we go. Once there the real truth came out and the 
daughter fled away with all what was saved to save her mother. Things got worse 
as business went down and I had 2 operations which left me out for 18 months, 
after 8 yrs a court settlement was reached with my ex wife and was in her 
favour. I WAS LEFT WITH NOTHING. All the people I have helped has deserted me 
and gossiped about me. One particular friend remained close in the most needed 
time and another has popped out now. New people are coming into my life through 
these people who somehow supports me. The Lesson are there to learn .When you 
swim and make yourself visible around sharks you can only be dead, handicapped 
or marked. Change in attitude is the solution.<br>

life. I never understood what it meant to be involved in politics. I never 
understood why people were insecure and suspicious. It was only in university 
where I had the first taste of what it meant to be torn. I was too friendly and 
honest. Everyone was friendly and you tell the truth. However, it will come back 
to bite you in the backside. Once you're in trouble, people who wanted your help 
in the past will pretend that they don't know who you are. You will see all your 
fair-weather friends for who they are. You will never see it coming until it's 
too late. People who used to smile to you will pretend that you don't exist and 
avoid you like the plague. But every cloud has a silver lining. It's in these 
times that you will filter out the trash from you real friends. <br>

<p>Hello Dave,<br>
I have a friend here in my first job.We've been together for 6 months. Other 
says that we are like &quot;kambal&quot; or &quot;bestfriend&quot; because of seeing us from tym to 
tym in our company together.From the start,We always eat together from 
breakfast, lunch,snacks and sometimes dinner before going home at night.And I really enjoyed her company. You know what, 
I treat her as my best bud or my 
bestfriend in our office.If there is only person in our office that I can 
trust,she is.When there is problem within office works and even personal 
problems.<br>
Sometimes when we dont talk to each other because of mis understanding; I really 
feel sad.To the point that I don't talk too much in our office and cannot 
concentrate with my work.It really affects me when we don't talk just like we 
always do.<br>

<i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Hi Avril. It's good to hear you have a good friend, and your point about feeling 
loss when your friend is not there is quite normal. It will settle down after a 
while and you'll be able to work ok when your friend is not there. Be careful 
not to be too clingy -- when one side of a friendship needs contact more than 
the other, it can push the other person away.</i></p>

<p>My gay friend thinks I like him so now I'm afraid I might lose his 
friendship, just because he doesn't want me to carry my hopes up. <br>

</b>Relationships are two-sided, Ana, with both give and take in ways that work 
for both people. You should be able to express your concerns and feelings in a 
caring way that does not damage the friendship.</i></p>

<p>Friends are entirely predictable. When you have something they want you will 
have friends and relatives. When you need something you will no friends or 
relatives. The only person you will ever be able to be sure of is you. </p>

<p>&nbsp;I read about fair-weather friend. I have a friend who is there when I need him during difficult times - he is a sounding board for me, but he is not 
there during good times! I questioned him on it and he denied it! says he is 
always there - don't think he realises how fickle his friendship is LOL <br>

Friends are people, too. They have needs, values, beliefs and preferences, just 
like you. At least this one helps sometimes. Some 'friends' want more than they 
give. And some are happy to give, perhaps because it makes them feel good. </i>
</p><hr>
<p>Hello sir, </p>
<p>I came upon this site while I was searching about friends who seem not 
friends. I was searching for it bec.for the past few months I have been feeling 
depressed. It's been 2 years since I've known this group of friends (I seem to 
have) but they seem to be drifting away. Here's the story: we were originally 4 
in the group, one person there I consider a &quot;toxic&quot; person bec. she just drains 
my energy. All the while I thought it was just me when suddenly the other 2 
opened up to me about this and we seem to be under an agreement or something. 
Note: they initiated this talk behind the back of the toxic person. But lately 
seems to me the world turned upside down and I'm the one feeling left out. It's 
not that I want to leave that person out of the picture, but the other 2 is even 
going out on gimmicks and the likes with the toxic girl and I'm not even aware 
of it. At first I thought they're just being civil but then now they seem to be 
enjoying her company more.</p>
<p>I don't want to appear needy of friends or anything but what they're doing is 
really hurting me, there's even some instance where it hurts me through bec. 
they seem to only remember me when they need to have a copy of my notes in 
class. It's so demoralizing having to meet people like them, it makes me feel as 
if I'm a very cruel person to be experiencing all of this. It seems so hard 
finding real friends nowadays and it really makes me treasure the real friends I have in high school and college. Right now 
I don't know where to go or whom to 
trust, although I'm still thankful I'm still eating lunch with someone (although 
it's fine to eat alone) I still feel somehow betrayed. I'm thinking of opening 
up but I'm thinking if they're real friends they should have felt my pain a long 
time ago (and my face is fairly expressive so you can tell if I'm irritated, sad 
or what). I'm enduring for just a few months now and come next school year 
hopefully I can successfully switch seats and hopefully I can have even just one 
true friend who'll be there and I'll be there for her too. <br>
</p>
<p>-- Sam</p>
<p><br>
<i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Hi Sam. Friendship's a two-way thing and the only rule is that however the 
relationship works, it has to work for both people. So if people aren't acting 
like the friends you want, then it's just a mismatch. It happens often and you 
have to persevere. Finding friends is like finding a partner - sometimes you 
have to 'kiss a lot of frogs'. When people are unkind, remember that it's about 
the tension they feel inside -- in other words, it's not about you, and the best 
approach (unless you're a therapist) is often to go elsewhere. The best approach 
to finding friends is to respect everyone and avoid those who do not respect 
you. Then explore gently from there.</i></p><hr>
<p>Friends?<br>
Although I have a few self-esteem issues I feel that I really only hear from 
'friends' when they need comforting or help with computers/gym/etc. always 
putting myself out there for others and I guess never for myself. Each time I return home, 
I check my answering machine and no calls.... texts, hardly a 
thing.<br>
Now I am in hospital after falling in and I have gotten to the point where I didn't want to tell anyone. After all, how bad a person must 
I be for those 
people to only want me for something? So now I distance myself even in my times 
of need. Sad, lonely and upsetting at times. Some may read this and tell me to 
snap out of it, others may not...<br>
<br>
I guess we all have to live with our actions and in-actions! <br>
<br>

&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><b>Dave replies:</b><br>
Hi Al. Finding real friends who will help you when you are down can be a tricky 
business. Paradoxically, the best way is not to look for them. When you seek 
friends, you do not always find good friends. There are plenty of people who 
want to take more than give and who are always on the lookout for the givers of 
life. Paradoxically also, those who are happier giving than receiving also are 
happier overall. If you can help people and not want anything in return, you can 
find surprising happiness. You might also look for people in real need (for 
example by doing voluntary work) more than those who turn out to be fairweather 
friends.</i></p>
<hr>
<p>People are hard to understand sometimes. It is difficult to let people, whose 
company you have enjoyed and who also enjoyed yours, go. I had a &quot;friend&quot; tell 
me that it's time to move on. What does that mean? Does it mean you?re no longer 
good enough? Now the need will be filled elsewhere? It makes you feel like you 
did something wrong, but you didn?t. I guess he just needed something new. </p>
<p>He has since gotten a new set of friends, but still calls occasionally. It's 
just not the same. I feel like I've been set aside for the new friends and feel 
kinda jealous. ?? </p>
<p>So how do you get over something like that? It would be easier not to have 
any contact because you almost get hopeful. But I know I'm worth more than the 
now backburner friend. How do you get over that? </p>
<p>-- Sally<br>
<br>
<i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>People want different things from friendships and it's most tricky when one 
wants to move closer and the other wants to move further away. Needs also vary 
with time, with some wanting longer relationships and others wanting shorter or 
variable ones. The result is pain, anguish, frustration, jealousy and other 
emotions as you do not get what you want from a relationship. If someone wants a 
more distant relationship and this makes life uncomfortable for you, then maybe 
it's easier if you just leave them be, stop banging your head against this brick 
wall, and look for the type of relationship you really want elsewhere.</i></p>

<p>I hvn't read everything on this site.. just a bit here n a bit there.. 
mashallah iv been blessed with a great set of friends.. ur site is called 
changingminds.org.. r u telling people that they can have good friends or that 
they cant which way r u changing their mind cuz some of the stuff iv read, 
replies I mean, are quite depressing.. I mustve misunderstood but hey be a good 
friend n I'm sure u will hv good friends in return.. n being a good friend means 
telling a person that they are using u, not being honest with u, being a jerk so 
on n so forth if u think they are isn't it? <br>
<br>
also I wondered if you (Dave - the administrator) are a man of faith? Cause iv 
found that helps me with not just the friends bother but every other that the 
world can offer, if we all only read n try to understand what our books tell us. 
I wish peace upon u n all the other readers. <br>

&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Well hello Israh. You are right in saying that being a good friend is a 
prerequisite to having good friends, but what does 'friend' mean? For many, it 
means 'someone who will give me what I want when I need it', which can be a 
problem because that means making demands on your friends and it could be said 
that is not always a friendly thing to do. It is when 'friends' have a different 
interpretation of what that particular friendship means that problems ensue.<br>
<br>
As to the question of faith. Well, yes I have faith in people. I believe that, 
despite fears, angers and the terrible things we do to one another, most people 
are fundamentally good. We are also imperfect and most have deep troubles that 
they wrestle with, and which can lead to dysfunctional external behaviour. Put 
simply, we are all broken, but we are doing the best with what we have. We are 
also all perfect and have the means to right our wrongs. One of the most 
fundamental things we can do is to accept others as they are, not blaming them 
for their imperfection nor for ours, and to accept ourselves likewise and seek 
always to improve.</i></p>

<p>hello. my bestfriend dated my boyfriend and now my ex-boyfriend, my

million of times if he likes my bestfriend but he didn't answer me. and now 
their together, I still gave them a chance because I love them and I want them

please help... I can forgive but I dont forget...<br>

Hello Chiara. Did you know that if you keep asking a boy if he likes another 
girl he will think about liking her. And if you keep asking him, he'll keep 
thinking about it and then maybe he will like her just because he's thought 
about it so much. You have to trust people more, even when you have been 
disappointed in the past,. because if you don't you'll end up repeating history. 
Forgiveness is a blessing. Do make sure you have truly forgiven. Let go of the 
uncomfortable past and decide to have a beautiful future.</i> </p><hr>
<p>I'm in the military and move about every 3 years with my husband and, now, 2 
young boys. I often find a group of women right away so I feel &quot;at home&quot;. 
I have 
met tons of really nice women. Some I feel very close to, others are nice to 
chat with because of school or a group, etc. <br>
<br>
It is difficult moving because I always have the fear of someone not wanting to 
invest their time in me becaue I have &quot;one foot out the door&quot;. I do understand 
this, but it still hurts. I've also experienced friendships where I've become 
close regardless of the time I have with a person.<br>
<br>
I think I've come to the conclusion that I always need that &quot;confidant&quot; 
everywhere I move. That person who understands how I think, can open up to me, 
and me to them, have the same sense of humor. I need this person to kind of &quot;get 
me through&quot; (works both ways) my normalcy in what, I think, is a very sad and 
sometime fulfilling way to live---moving with the military. I've been fortunate 
to find this every where I've moved.<br>
<br>
My confidant, in this move, has kind of moved on to someone else. She still 
phones but much less. Our boys don't play together anymore but do still like 
each other and talk--they've moved on. Problem is, I'm having the same reaction 
as most of your other posts. I'm hurt, jealous, angry, trying to be realistic (esp/w 
military), maybe she found someone she likes better, their sons only play w/each 
other, etc). <br>
<br>
Dave, I know what you're saying about friendships having to work for both 
people, I guess I just hate the &quot;grieving&quot; process or the waiting to get used to 
the change where it doesn't hurt so much. Esp, if I come to the conclusion that 
she is/was a fairweather friend or maybe a decent one, but doesn't need me like 
she used to. I could go on and on about how we used to see each other a lot, 
talk a lot, etc. but it's changed. I'm just trying to get over it. It's just 
hard. I don't like feeling this way about people who I'm just going to leave. 
It's funny how my 6 year old has moved on w/many friends but I'm still stuck 
with being consumed by the change in my friendship with his friends mom.<br>
<br>
I guess it's nice, for me, that I still care and not jaded, even if the 
friendship is for a short while. But I'm in my mid 40's and tired of starting 
over everytime I go somewhere. I think what I need from you is a pap talk. 
Thanks. <br>

<i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Well I must say I'm impressed with the effort you make every time to get to 
know people and I do hope at least some of them appreciate this. In all jobs 
there are swings and roundabouts, good and bad things. One thing it does teach 
you is how to make friends (It'll do the same for your kids). And when you move 
on you still have those friends (albeit not right next door) and you can leave 
behind those whose company you'd rather not keep. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; As when you're living in a single place, not all friendships work 
and this can be upsetting. This is normal and human. The only thing to do is to 
learn to let go and move on, which I guess the military life teaches you 
something about. Is it all tiring? Sure it is. I work 13-14 hour days and get 
pooped. My wife's a teacher which is one of the most exhausting jobs out, and by 
the weekend she's knackered. But then she picks herself up and continues, as do 
we all because we must. One of the most important abilities to develop is 
resilience, bouncing back from a loss or tiredness. It's also important to know 
how to recharge your batteries and take the time to do this (which as a working 
mom both difficult and essential).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Having a confidant is a neat way of doing this and developing such 
a close relationship in a short period is a real skill. When it doesn't work and 
when you move on, you're right, there's a grieving process. It's a pain but it's 
also important to use it to help you work through the process. I'm a Brit and 
we're great at denial, which means we can get stuck in grieving for ages. If you 
can face the situation, get angry and cry, then know you will feel better, then 
it's a much better way.&nbsp; </i></p><hr>
<p>My best friend since elementary one day decided she didn't want to be my 
friend anymore. This came as a shock to me. I asked why several times and never 
got a straight answer. She said it was time to part ways and she wanted to have 
a fresh start since she had just gotten divorced. This was almost a year ago. 
I'm still hurting till this day. I don't understand how someone who I loved and 
who I thought loved me just let me go like a pair of old shoes. Now it seems I cant find any friends. And the ones 
I have made only use me when they don't have 
anything else to do or if they need a favor. I feel so sad and at the same time 
so angry because I don't feel like I deserve this. I know I'm a good friend. I have become a loner n 
I think I'm depressed but don't want to admit it. <br>

decided not to be my friend when we went to senior school. It was hurtful at the 
time but in the end I think it was a good thing. I was determined not to try to 
make him my friend again -- if he wanted to be a friend he had to decide 
himself. As it happens he then went off the rails and got into trouble and I was 
glad we weren't friends any more. Sometimes things happen. </i></p>

<p>I have a friend, shes been my best friend for years now, on her 17ths 
birthday I wanted to do something special for her as it was also the last year 
of high school, so I've spent all year saving up and I got about 1.5k which I spent and bought her a branded goods and dinner with her family and friends. 
Money doesn't matter to me but when it came to my birthday a couple of months 
later she got me nothing. I had a talk about it with another friend on the same 
topic she was mad and said she should of at least gotten u card or smoothing 
which got me thinking as well. its not the only thing I've done for her through 
out the years I've bought her heaps of things when we were out, lent her money 
when she needed it, did her home work when she couldn't and I'd always be there 
to listen to her problems. the only thing I care for really is that she treats 
me so badly compared to other guys who have done nothing compared to me and I really don't know what to do about it. <br>

<p><i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Hi Makky. You were very generous to your friend and I don't know what she 
thinks about this, but if a friend spent a lot of money on me, I'd be very 
embarrassed, especially if I did not have the money to reciprocate or I was 
given things I didn't really want. I might also suspect the friend and be a bit 
annoyed that maybe they were trying to force me to give something in return. In 
this way I might want to punish the friend for making me feel so uncomfortable.
</i></p>
<p><i>You can't buy friendship and spending a lot on friends can have the 
reverse effect, pushing them away and making them dislike you. And some people 
will punish you by continuing to accept your gifts and giving nothing in return.</i></p>
<hr>
<p>I just moved here, a totally new place. New country, new people, etc.<br>
<br>
Im not sure if the friends I have now are real. Even though we call each other 
sisters or say I love you and miss you to each other, when I need them the most, 
they arent there. Even when I tell them outright. When they need me, I try to 
help them with the best that I can. I cant even feel much concern from them. I dont know what to do cuz everyone in class seems fake too. And 
I keep thinking 
that maybe I'm just too paranoid.<br>
<br>
All my life ive only had guy friends, and I'm a girl. Now that I'm in college, in 
a diff country, I thought maybe I should change that. So maybe theres something 
wrong with me and not with them?<br>
<br>
I actually, theres more to it, but it would be too long if I put it all in here. 
This is the best summary I could make. lol. I hope you get the picture.<br>

</b>In different countries and places there can be different cultures which have 
different rules for friendship. To be friends, you have to find out those rules, 
which can be tricky as people won't tell you and may don't know them explicitly 
themselves. Try watching how others are friends to understand. There's nothing 
wrong with you, Louise. You're just somewhere new. Don't blame (yourself or 
others). Just seek to understand and adapt.</i></p>

<p>well I'm in high school and I have 3 close people That I consider a close 
friend . But someone came back and told me that one of my friends were talking 
bad about my body this isn't the first time she's said something wrong because 
she said she never used to like for no reason at all I don't know if she jealous 
because she fat.</p>
<p>My Other friend were not as close. She told me something about my ex that I felt she was trying to throw in my face that hurt me so bad 
I don't talk to her. 
Our friendship has had its ups but mostly downs. My third friend I don't really 
talk to either because I guess she has other friends . I feel so unappreciated 
by them they can't even remember my birthday. I buy them stuff for their 
birthday and they they can't even do the same I don't expect nothing but it 
would be nice to get something back ....i have made up my mind to stay away from 
them to make them see what a good friend I was to them but I'm so done with 
trying I always been there when they were down and they were never really there 
for me...they Always wasn't to talk bad about people and called them names and 
make fun of people .i don't want to do that because I'm very humble and care 
about people for who they are.<br>

</b>Hi Jay -- sounds like you've got a lot figured. Friendship's a two-way 
street and if what they want and what you want are different, then splitting up 
is probably the right thing. Don't worry. If you care about others then you'll 
find friends who'll care about you. Sometimes it may seem like there's nobody 
out there who understands, but there are. It just takes time to find them. I didn't have great friends in high school but found wonderful people at college 
and we're still friends even though it was many years ago.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;I have a boyfriend that just reacquainted him self with a old high 
school friend. They haven't seen or talked to each other in almost 10 years. I was ok with it at 1st but she started to act funny. We would be in town and she 
would say that she was to busy to hang out with us. but if he was in town alone 
then she would try to make plans to spend time with him. they haven't spend time 
together yet, but this has happen more then once. <br>
I told him how I felt about it and that it would make me feel little better if 
he lessen the calls. He lied to me and told me ok &quot;i understand&quot;. I found out 
that they are still textn and talking over the phone nothings changed. When I said something to him he told me if he wanted her he would have been dated her 
in school and he also said she has issues. just don't understand why hold on to 
so one so bad if its making your relationship a mess.<br>

treat me as her best friend as well. sometimes I cant stop myself from judging 
her for everytime she ask a help from me she keeps on txting me, calling me but 
when she is already okay it seems that she dont answer my call and when she 
reply me with my text messages it seems that she is just forced to text me back.

</b>Judging your friends too much can be dangerous, as one of the reasons for 
friendship is to forgive and not to judge.&nbsp; Friendship is also a two-way

to work. If she's asking more than you want to give then this is not friendship. 
The same is true the other way around, of course.</i></p>

<p>I am the classic frienemy, admittedly, after having an 6 month sexual and 
ideological long distance relationship with a girl. During the relationship, she 
and I promised to be friends no matter what. The relationship soured after I acted stupid because of grief and worked with the wrong therapist to negotiate 
the emotional snares. I became ambivalent thereafter because of incidents 
immediately before, during, and after the break up. </p>
<p>Can you tell me some stories of your experiences or experiences of those you 
know who worked through the ambivalence successfully? </p>
<p>bee</p>
<p><i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Ambivalence can be just due to a lack of natural empathy, which can be both 
genetic and a result of early repression. The brain is a very complex instrument 
and many people have to cope with limitations. One way is to learn strategies in 
which you 'act' rather than appearing to not care. Learn to watch the body 
language and listen to what others say and how they say it. Watch how others 
interact and try to copy responses. I have known several people with such 
conditions as Asperger's Syndrome learn to fit in very well using this method.
</i></p>
<p><i>The most important thing is that you care and want to do something about 
the ambivalence and the effect it has on your life. Your therapist can help. 
Look for inspiration in others who have also found ways to success.</i></p>

<p>Family members can be fair-weather-friends too. My mother is a fair-weather 
friend. She is nice to me and present in my life when I am feeling happy and 
doing well. She is critical, rude and avoidant of me when I am in need of any 
help or empathy. She avoids all responsibility for the dissolution of our 
relationship. She tells me that I am draining her when I ask for her to listen 
to me or when I tell her I want to share my less than happy feelings. I think, 
in general, passive-aggressive people are fair-weather-friends. They have no 
idea how to contribute equally to a relationship and then play victim when 
others are naturally disappointed and ask more of them. They play the eternal 
victim while assuming no responsibility for giving anything in return. Perhaps 
that stems from not having the capacity to give anything (i.e., low self-esteem, 
poor social skills, etc.). The problem is that when it is a family member, you 
can't let go of them. You just have to accept them for the way they are and 
learn not to rely on them for anything. </p>

<p><i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>You're right. Family can be this way and it's a dilemma when you can't leave 
them and when they become persistently needy but give nothing back. In the end 
you have to figure out what to do about them. You can discuss them with others. 
You can avoid them as much as possible. You can minimize the conversation with 
them. Often, they are not so much 'fairweather' as just difficult. Both parents 
and children can cling to their roles long after they should be treating each 
other like adults. Sibling rivalry for attention can reach way into adulthood. 
And some are so emotionally weak they can take but they cannot give. And when 
they find other friends give up on them, they turn to their family, who cannot 
turn away. Sad, but surprisingly common.</i> </p>
<hr>
<p>I think I have a fair weather friend. We were so close and spent a lot of 
time together. Then she got a boyfriend and our time together went down 
significantly. Then they broke up so we spent more time together. Then she 
joined support groups and is not making time for me any more. This hurts. I do 
not want to be friends with her anymore. We have a lot in common so I am sad to 
see the friendship go. But I cannot stand feeling used. </p>

<p>I found what you wrote to be pretty inspiring. I especially love the title of 
this post in connection with what you said. Friends are such an impactful part 
of out lives and I don't think many of us realize that sometimes. <br>

<p>I really feel for Sonia, and there was another post similar that made me 
reflect on my experiences. I have had similar feelings, and hearing theirs 
helped me understand that anyone who is caring will care if a friendship 
changes, especially if it is changed abruptly or with any neglect of empathy for 
the other's right of closure. Both of these responses were not answered, 
although there were so many to respond to, and they were responded to so well, I tried to think of a response to them. </p>
<p>I think that there are people who want to give support, friendship and love, 
like Dave mentioned, it's just that it's easy to feel/ or become isolated and be 
in pain until this is physically realized, vs rationally. Hearing these people 
go through pain over the awkwardness of a changing relationship makes me wish 
you could send out wishes of hope that they will realize they are great, and 
that if they wish for this type of friendship it will come when they realize 
that they have so much worth to offer. </p>

<p>I know this blog is pretty old and I might not even get an answer and it's 
ok but I just needed somebody to talk to. I am 32 years old and spend most of my 
life in the UK, I came back to my home country at age 26 and tried making 
friends from scratch. It wasnt very easy but I thought by being accepting I 
would meet people and I did. Then I got engaged to this man and kept all those 
people in my life. However life had other plans for me. I lost my job, my fiance 
dumped me and got back with his ex and had zero support from my family. I ended 
up living in a basement flat away from the centre. I found that most of my 
&quot;friends&quot; abandoned me. Some made excuses that I lived too far away and they couldnt spare the time/petrol money whatever to come visit! Although I live 5 
minutes away from the metro station it is still TOO far away for them to visit 
and they expect me to do all the visiting or not see them at all. I suppose my 
being broke is not a concern of theirs!! Thier solution was to simply talk to me 
on the phone!! Other &quot;friends&quot; visited my flat and only had negative comments 
to make about how &quot;low I have stooped&quot; (I used to live in a very modern flat 
with my ex). Some were even happy I broke up with my ex because they thought I 
had this brilliant life!!! Since December 2011 I've heard so many cutting 
remarks about my life, choices, job situation etc that I could write a book on 
&quot;how to bring your friend down&quot;. And to top it all up, some of my female 
friends that are not single anymore are too &quot;scared&quot; to go out with me cause I 
am single and available!!! I only have one friend left! And of course my UK 
friends thank Jesus for facebook and skype. Technology keeps me safe. I need to 
start over and rebuild my life from scratch and I am finding it very hard. I was 
talking to this UK friend of mine the other day and she said that it is actually 
for the best that I found out NOW who my real friends are rather than keep on 
giving and giving and over extending myself and helping people out all the time 
that were clearly envious of me and are enjoying my &quot;demise&quot;. I'm not saying 
THEY are only to blame. My low self-esteem has attributed to all of this. I was 
afraid of loneliness and I suppose I was TOO accommodating...but now that I need 
somebody local to just listen for a change there is nobody there! Thank you for 
listening and I am sorry for the long post. </p>

<p>I recently had to get rid of a few so-called &quot;friends&quot;. I am 40 and these 
&quot;friends&quot; were blokes who fancied me in one way or another. Two were married and 
angling for an affair (dear God), one I did not fancy back at all and was making 
me very uncomfortable, and one was an FWB. All of them except for one talked 
smack about me behind my back and all of them were extremely patronizing. I feel 
there is an element of jealousy involved as I am in a creative profession and 
have worked very hard at it even though I do not make much money. I am not tied 
to the material things of life and couldn't care less that I have a simple 
lifestyle. They see me enjoying my creative lifestyle and are unhappy because 
they feel insecure around me and uncertain of their life's path. So they try to 
make me feel insecure in return by criticizing or trying to control me. </p>
<p>One of them even said &quot;I HATE YOU!&quot; after I had said goodbye after a night 
out and turned my back!! Now I wasn't sure about this person's motives anyway 
and I thought &quot;well I really don't CARE if you hate me, but at least say it to 
my face&quot;!!! His patronizing behaviour got very unpleasant in the end and in fact 
I knew he had been talking about me behind my back very early on in the 
friendship . This was because I hadn't made any movement towards wanting to have 
a &quot;relationship&quot; with him (which is fair enough) and so I was on the receiving 
end of snide remarks from his friends about &quot;people who use others&quot;. Now I 
suppose I should have offered my own counter-remark about &quot;people who try to buy 
others&quot; at this point, but perhaps I'll save that up for when it happens 
again...I don't need o be around that sort of atmosphere , so I told him I 
didn't enjoy his company as I once did. </p>
<p>After having got rid of these people I don't feel so much of an urge to reach 
for the booze as I did and I can only assume this was because they were 
stressing me out! <br>

<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp; Cancer, for me was the real revealing factor; the 
measuring&nbsp; stick to determine who is a real friend and who is not. I was shocked 
by some so-called 'great friends&quot; who, upon hearing from me that I have cancer,&nbsp; 
showed their true, unsavory colors (and got fired by me out of my life swiftly) 
Some said trite things to essentially say &quot;There there, All will be well and 
good. Now shut up and let's not talk about your silly problem&quot; and some, 
shockingly, upon hearing the grim news, responded to everything BUT the news and 
literally IGNORED the fact they'd just been told. For instance, I showed one 
friend a painting I had done and then mentioned it is something I was inspired 
to do after learning I have a rare and aggressive kind of cancer (GIST) That 
&quot;friend&quot; responded, &quot;Hey, keep up the good work!&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">WTF? So on the flip side, some people who I did not 
think cared that much about me were and still are so THERE for me. I ask nothing 
but alas, they are there to offer some emotional support, socialization, one guy 
brings me fresh fruits and vegetables, another bought me a new bed, my 
ex-husband gave me the best birthday of&nbsp; my life and has been a constant 
support, someone else bought a painting and took me out to lunch, some offer to 
do my laundry while others invite me to social gatherings or come to visit, 
call,&nbsp; do research, offer assistance. So--cancer and really any strife a person 
goes though sure as heck weeds out the fine friends from the fairweather bogus 
non-friends. I am swift to ditch the bad friends and let them know precisely why 
they are being fired.No room for debate or&nbsp; discussion Just fired. Some 
instances of when it's tie to be a GOOD friend should just be known&nbsp; Those who 
fail--well they're out. If ever&nbsp; questioning your&nbsp; judgement in the A-hole 
social filtration-unit,&nbsp; ask yourself how much of a JERK would YOU have to be to 
behave the same way in times of your own true in-need friend's strife-induced 
dilemma? Then you know t's time to pull&nbsp; a &quot;Donald Trump&quot; and fire their 
incompetent selves; perhaps while adding link&nbsp; to the PIL song &quot;Fair-well My 
Fair-weathered Friend&quot;&nbsp; for&nbsp; added&nbsp; &quot;effect&quot; </p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">That feels good to exact some measure of quality-control 
in the friend department. Key thing is weed that precious garden of your 
social-life of the rubbish stress-inducers and keep only the gems and be 
grateful and a good friend to them in return too. Real friends are gold. False 
friends are toxic. &nbsp;</p>
