<p><i>Sunday 15-December-19</i><h2>Well, at least Brexit is on the road to 
somewhere now</h2>
<p>Historic election, landslide for the Tories, Labour meltdown. All terms that 
have been bandied about after last week's UK General Election. Followed with 
macabre interest around the world, Brexit has been a partner to Trump in 
international bafflement in how turkeys will sometimes vote en masse for a 
slap-up Christmas dinner. Labour lost seats it has held since the 1930s. The 
Liberal Democrats, the only straight-up Remain party, went nowhere. And the 
Conservative party got a thumping majority that will allow it to steamroller 
through whatever laws it likes.</p>
<p>So what happened? Labour's leader, Jeremy Corbyn has come across as a 
ditherer, trying to appeal to both the Leave and Remain parts of his party. He 
then offered a huge spending budget including such strange items as free 
broadband for everyone. With financing by swingeing taxation on the rich and big 
companies (many of who were ready to leave the country as needed).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Boris Johnson, the recently-elected Conservative leader, kicked 
out the remainers in his party, including well-known and long-standing MPs. He 
then suspended parliament in an attempt to force through Brexit, though he lost 
the legal battle over this. By the time the election came around, he had a clear 
reputation of being very serious about getting Brexit done (indeed, that was his 
slogan). And other than some promises about spending on the police (restoring 
numbers to pre-Conservative levels), health and education, he got through with a 
bunch of corny stunts and bashing the Brexit message at every opportunity.</p>
<p>It was very much a battle of personalities. While Corbyn came over as 
authentic and caring, against Boris' thuggish and even dishonest assertions, the 
Conservatives caught the weary mood that, after three and a half years, people 
really did want to get past the endless Brexit debate. Despite officially 
leaving the EU in January, Brexit will be far from done as trade negotiations 
will follow. It seems the Conservatives are setting up for a hard Brexit at the 
end of the year if agreement is not found, thereby laying down a potentially 
catastrophic <a href="../../disciplines/negotiation/articles/walk-away.htm">
walk-away</a>. Yet the Europeans really do not want this and it seems a 
hard-edged negotiating ploy that could lead to agreements more beneficial to the 
UK than might have been otherwise.</p>
<p>Already, the Conservatives are flexing muscles for very controversial 
changes, with suggestions that they may weaken and potentially kill off the BBC 
through indirect funding cuts. Expect more shock as great
<a href="../../explanations/power/power.htm">power</a> stalks the corridors of 
Whitehall. There are libertarian idealists supporting behind the party, with 
smaller government and huge tax cuts potentially in the offing. There are also 
hints in the Conservative manifesto of gerrymandering and weakening the ability 
of the courts to hold politicians to account.</p>
<p>And yet this is democracy in action. People vote for politicians who seem to 
resonate with their mood, not those who have their best interests at heart. And 
authoritarians in power can work to sustain that power for the long term, until 
fairness is forgotten and the class system reverts to something closer to the 
old aristocracy. Boris might become a British Trump. Or he might yet wrest free 
of the right-wing manacles that have bound him, and become a much-loved leader. 
This is not an empty idea -- he is a biographer of Churchill and likes the
<a href="../../disciplines/leadership/theories/great_man_theory.htm">Great Man 
Theory</a>, to the point where he probably believes himself such a person, and 
consequently does enough good to gain the respect of the common person.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the opposition may reinvent itself and build a huge social 
power base that seizes power in a flip leftwards, as might happen with the 
rising younger generations, for example. Power, in practice, is often a 
pendulum, swinging from authoritarians to socialists and back.</p>
<p>I guess we'll see.</p>

<p><i>Sunday 03-November-19</i><h2>The Power of Credibility in Politics (and How 
This is Not Always Enough)</h2>
<p>We are going through a radical time in politics at the moment. In particular 
if you are in the US or the UK you may be glued to the reporting on the 
Impeachment proceedings of Donald Trump or the UK General Election that is 
coming up on 12th December. In these, the power of credibility is being shown as 
critical to success.</p>
<p>In the USA, career diplomats and those in administrative posts have been 
clear and very credible as they gave their testimonies. Many have a strong 
history of unstinting and loyal service to their company. Most had comprehensive 
notes about key moments in the past. When asked questions they largely were able 
to give concise answers. Republican attempts at confusing or trapping them were 
largely rebuffed. Indeed, some of the questioners gave up on this and resorted 
to simple and repetitive monologues in their allotted time periods, rather than 
being shown up by the clear and credible witnesses.</p>
<p>In the UK, a recent edition of Question Time, where members of the public 
asked sharp questions to party leaders, brought credibility to the fore. Nicola 
Sturgeon, the Scottish National Party leader, was adjudged to be the winner. She 
listened to the audience, avoided traps and spoke clearly (although her 
unsurprising focus on Scotland and independence did not really help her 
credibility with the rest of the UK). Jo Swinson of the Liberal Democrats got 
mired in defending past actions rather than owning up and moving on. Boris 
Johnson of the Conservatives came off worst. Already known for his Trumpian 
looseness with the truth, he seemed cynical in his turning everything to the 
subject of Brexit. Perhaps the best for credibility was left-wing Jeremy Corbyn 
of the Labour Party, who was straightforward about his strong social policies, 
even though these are loudly ringing alarm bells on the political right.</p>
<p>Credibility comes from a combination of competence, clarity and honesty. If 
you seem to know what you are doing, are communicating clearly, and are honest 
even when it does not quite serve you, then you will be taken more seriously. 
And yet this is not always enough. In the USA, Trump may be acquitted by the 
Senate. In the UK, Boris's Conservatives are way ahead in the polls. Which 
perhaps goes to show that, while credibility is important, politics and its 
accompany persuasion is more complex than we at first might suppose.</p>

<p><i>Sunday 03-November-19</i><h2>To change lives, change what people tell 
themselves about the world, others and (most of all) themselves </h2>
<p>When you think about yourself, how often do you think about your past and 
things that have happened. </p>
<p>One of our deep needs is to explain. When we understand why things happened 
as they did, we can predict the future, avoid threats and take advantage of 
opportunities. When we think about events in our lives, this explanation comes 
in terms of cause and effect, with the effect being on ourselves. </p>
<p>The bigger question in attributing cause is in what is called 'locus of 
control'. If we blame other people or natural events, the cause is external. We 
are victims who deserve help, not punishment. We are fatalistic in thinking 
there is nothing we can do, and so we do nothing other than to perpetuate a 
'poor me' pattern. </p>
<p>The alternative locus is internal, where we causally link our own thoughts 
and actions to what happens to us. Taking this path is not that easy. It means 
taking responsibility for one's own life. It means being adult as we leave 
behind the last vestiges of childhood. It means accepting failure as a natural 
step on the way to learning and improvement. </p>
<p>These two approaches can be found in many writings. In Petty and Caccioppo's 
Elaboration Likelihood Model, we may think peripherally, with heuristics, schema 
and other cognitive short-cuts, or we may think centrally and consciously. In 
Carol Dweck's 'Mindset' we are divided into fixed and growth mindsets. In fixed 
thinking, we assume we are who we are and cannot change, while the growth 
mindset assumes we can be who we want to be and achieve anything. </p>
<p>In his marvellous book 'Redirect', professor Tim Wilson investigates 
large-scale US social change programs aimed at such problems as teenage 
pregnancy and drug addiction. Notably, he finds that hard-hitting approaches 
fail. These include such as 'Scared Straight', where police officers and former 
offenders go into schools and tell it like it is. This seems puzzling as you 
might think in-your-face hard truths would make teenage realize the folly of 
such ways. The reality was the opposite. Seeing the short-term buzz above 
longer-term costs, offending rates actually rose. The teenage brain is designed 
to make risks attractive and their under-developed prefrontal cortex is not yet 
equipped to see far into the future. </p>
<p>What Wilson found did work, was simply to change the story that children told 
themselves about themselves. Our sense of identity is tied strongly to our 
self-narrative. Change the narrative and we make different decisions. This can 
work with adults, but is massively more powerful with conflicted teenagers who 
are still figuring out who they really are. Of course this is not always easy, 
but Wilson did find that it works. </p>
<p>So to create change that people will buy, it seems you should create and tell 
inclusive narratives that draw people in, connect themselves to the storyline 
and follow it to a new path.</p>

<p><i>Sunday 29-September-19</i><h2>The Boss Whisperer </h2>
<p>Power is, for some, so attractive they are driven to endlessly climb the 
tree. The greatest pleasure for them is the acquisition of power, followed by 
the exercise of it. Like an ardent lover, they relentlessly seek to possess 
their goal. </p>
<p>There are two routes to this. One is to be the boss, the person out front, 
the visible face of power. The other is to be the power behind the throne. Which 
one the person takes depends on personal preferences. If they are extraverted 
and enjoy the limelight, then they will likely seek the leading role. If they 
are more introverted thinkers, then quietly pulling strings may be more their 
style. </p>
<p>A common problem is that while the extravert, the public face, can hold an 
audience in thrall, they may lack ideas or execution and so need additional 
support. This is where the backroom leaders come in. </p>
<p>The whisperer role, the svengali, is the thinker. They come up with ideas to 
feed the front person, who often presents these as their own. They also watch 
from the shadows, noticing the detail of who says and does what, and advising 
the boss on what to say and do next. There are several traditional positions 
that can take the whisperer role, including the grand vizir, the fool or the 
spouse. Each may use a different style, but the role is largely the same. </p>
<p>There can also be a third role, of the implementer, the person who gets 
things done. The whisperer can take on this mantle too, but not necessarily so. 
Whether they do depends on their skill and preferences, as well as the boss's 
concern about investing too much power in one person. </p>
<p>This partnership can serve positive or negative purpose. Positively, their 
combined skills can transform communities and countries for the better. 
Negatively, they can do much harm as power corrupts. At the extremes of this 
negative frame, the front person may be a narcissist who basks in all the glory 
they can get, while the whisperer may be a psychopath, not needing admiration as 
ultimate control fulfils their deep needs. </p>
<p>Positively, I held this role a number of times across my career. I 
specialized in research, insight, business methods and psychology, but had no 
desire to lead. Indeed, I hated the idea even as I found it fascinating. And so 
I found leaders who appreciated my discoveries and together we pushed the 
envelope for a while. </p>
<p>In recent times, Steve Bannon in the USA played whisperer to Donald Trump, 
though he paid the price of becoming too visible and stealing too much of 
Trump's thunder. In the UK, Dominic Cummings has gained this role as chief 
advisor to Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Cummings is a shadowy figure about whom 
little is known, yet played a central role in the 2016 Brexit referendum, 
including coming up with the powerful clincher 'Taking back control'. Whether 
Cummings survives the brighter spotlight depends on his ability to steer Johnson 
and avoid the limelight.</p>

<p><i>Sunday 22-September-19</i><h2>How Norway sold salmon to Japan by changing 
its name</h2>
<p>In the 1980s, Japan was running short of wild Pacific salmon, due to 
overfishing. Meanwhile, Norway's domestic salmon farms were doing so well they 
satisfied their home market with fish to spare. Looking around the world, they 
spotted not only that the Japanese were short of salmon, but also that good raw 
fish commanded a much (often ten times) higher price than cooked fish.</p>
<p>Here's where their problems started. </p>
<p>Raw fish must be pure and free from parasites, which Pacific salmon are not. 
So the Japanese always cooked it, to kill these nasty bugs. The Norwegians knew 
they had a marketing challenge on their hands, so they hired a celebrity 
Japanese chef to create new sushi dishes and front the local operation. </p>
<p>A classic marketing ploy, but sadly it did little to stimulate the market. 
When the Japanese thought about eating raw salmon, after years of earnings about 
cooking this fish, they just didn't feel good. </p>
<p>So Norway tried something else. Something ridiculously simple. They changed 
the name. In Japan, salmon are called 'sake'. The name they now used was a 
rather European-sounding 'samon'. Different fish, they said. Cook salmon, but 
this one is healthy raw. </p>
<p>This worked! Sales of raw Norwegian fish-farmed 'samon' took off. </p>
<p>But why? It shows the power of naming. When we assign a name to something, we 
also include a z whole set of additional meaning, scripts, schema and other 
rules about how we respond to the word and the thing itself. </p>
<p>So the answer to the question 'What's in a name?' is 'Everything!'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Sunday 14-April-19</i><h2>Grumpy taxi drivers and the power of positivity</h2>
<p>My daughter told me the other day that she got into a taxi recently and said 
hello, but only got a grumpy response. Most people would take this as a signal 
that the driver did not want to talk and would just be quiet. My daughter is not 
that kind of person as she reads grumpiness as a challenge. She said 'Hmm. Looks 
like you got out of bed the wrong side.' She didn't get an apology, but did get 
a conciliatory 'Mmm'. She then kept up the positive approach and the 
conversation emerged. And by the end of the journey she knew a lot about the 
driver, who had cheered up considerably. Feeling good about spreading a little 
love and light, she walked into an important customer meeting.</p>
<p>It is so easy to be dragged down by people who are negative. Or, worse, we 
assume that other people are already thinking negatively and get infected by our 
own assumptions. In either case, it can put us into a poor mood and a potential 
slippery slope where we all go downhill and bad feelings just get worse.</p>
<p>When I had a day job, I would deliberately bounce into the office on a Monday 
morning, smiling and complimenting people. I'd get a 'what are you on' type of 
comment, but generally I found being positive raised the spirits of other people 
and gave me some brownie points that led to people being more open to listening 
and agreeing than they might otherwise be. At worst, I just felt good as the 
general mood improved.</p>
<p>Being positive is something you can do to yourself. Identify negative 
thinking before it gets to your body language or speech. Turn it around and see 
the positive side of things. Or just kick it into touch. Avoid blame, regret and 
other negative emotions that do no good whatsoever. Even if you don't feel to 
positive, act positive and the virtuous spiral you create will eventually make 
you happier.</p>
<p>And just smile! You'll be happy that you do.</p>
