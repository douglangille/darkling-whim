<p><i>Friday 11-Apr-08</i><h2>Growing pains</h2>
<p>I wrote last year of troubles with my teenage son and have since had several 
helpful conversations with others with similar experiences. Parenting problem 
teens is a trial by fire but although it has been far from plain sailing I know 
that it could always be worse.</p>
<p>So here's a synopsis of the past year.</p>
<p>After dropping out of school (which was after failing a year and being let 
back on a promise of knuckling down), he announced he was going to live with a 
friend in London. I felt we needed to stay in touch so helped him move. I got 
him a job with a friend in IT, but that lasted a little over a week - he quit 
after being told off about something ('they're all idiots'). </p>
<p>The London stay lasted about a month then he came home again, soon to go and 
live 'permanently' with a bunch of friends in a faraway town. For several months 
the only contact was when we phoned and when he deigned to pick up. We were 
careful here to remain positive and keep calls brief. After living on their 
charity for a while he fell out with them and left, moving to a series of 
friends with a similar pattern of dependency until Christmas, when he was on the 
point of being put out onto the streets.</p>
<p>He asked to come back. We said yes, but with a few conditions, like getting a 
job (and with the motivation of no internet until he had held one down for a 
month). He also brought a friend who would otherwise have been homeless. The 
friend had a transferable job and agreed to a nominal rent (which never got 
paid). When they fell out, we were left to clear up and lever the friend out.
</p>
<p>The biggest frustration for a long time has been that he just takes what he 
wants and gives pretty much nothing back ('I don't do housework'). He also 
distorts and uses anything you say against you ('You said you wanted me to be 
happy'). Our frustration at the selfishness has boiled over now and again but 
with little effect ('Get off my back!'). Largely, though, we've tried being 
tolerant and patient. Occasionally we see a gently and funny person peeking 
through and hope that this is the real person.</p>
<p>Several friends who know the whole story have expressed surprise that we 
haven't kicked him out, but despite all he has (and has not) said and done, we 
believe there is a fundamentally good person in there waiting to emerge. I think 
the biggest issue is that he is terrified of growing up and taking 
responsibility for his life. Like Peter Pan he has been clinging to the safety 
of childhood, where somebody else provides and he can play in his make-believe 
world.</p>
<p>Even as I write this, a new chapter may be beginning. He has got a job as a 
trainee butcher at Tesco's, the UK's leading grocery superstore where he starts 
today. He hasn't lasted more than a few days in any job yet, so I'll believe 
what I see, though I've got my fingers tightly crossed.</p>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">Your comments</h2>

<hr>

<p>This is what will happen to your son if you continue to enable him: he will 
eventually find someone and marry them. Then his wife is straddled with his 
irresponsibility. She marries him because she feels that she &quot;understands&quot; him 
and can &quot;help him.&quot; <br>
<br>
Unfortunately he never takes on the responsibility of becoming a responsible 
husband, homeowner, or citizen. Every time he is in trouble, his parents bail 
him out. He steals from his wife's bank account, invites unsavory friends over, 
has trouble with the law, makes his neighbors angry, and can?t take care of 
basic day-to-day household chores, starts drinking or abusing drugs. Each time 
his parents bail him out. <br>
<br>
His wife leaves in the hopes that he will &quot;hit bottom&quot; and finally realize what 
he needs to do to have a happy life. Instead his family bails him out again. The 
ex-wife is left picking up the pieces of her life.<br>
<br>
My ex is the son of a successful doctor. His family always enabled him. Their 
enabling created a menace on society. Please be tough on him or he will never 
grow up and he will be lost to you forever.<br>
<br>
-- Colleen<br>
<br>
<i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Thanks, Colleen. I do take your advice seriously and empathize with your 
situation. He has said he will be saving up to go and live with a friend, and 
we'll encourage (but not finance) that. We've also been very deliberate in 
giving him little whilst he is here -- he has food and shelter but little else. 
We will continue to withdraw as needed to ensure he stands on his own feet.</i></p>
<hr>

<p>It is sometimes difficult to realize that children and others in my life have 
free will and free choice. With the free will and free choices come consequences 
such as being homeless (almost) for your son and feeling the inner turmoil of 
wanting good things for someone who would rather walk their own path for your 
son\'s parents.<br>
<br>
I continue to receive life lessons in relationships from friends and family 
members. I hear an internal voice which sometimes say, &quot;You do have a problem!&quot; 
Sometimes to myself and occasionally out loud, when invited to join in the 
problem.<br>
<br>
In my life with age came increased wisdom and I hope it will work that way for 
your son as you lovingly do what you are willing to do and set reasonable 
boundaries for yourself..<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>
<br>
-- Gene</p>
<p>
<i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Aye, Gene, likewise I know I cannot live my children's lives for them. I 
have told them both that I just want them to be independent and happy. At the 
moment, my son is focusing on 'happy' first. One of the sad lessons of life is 
that food and shelter come first.&nbsp; </i></p>
<hr>

<p>Not that I have had experience raising a son, but I have put a lot of time in 
being one.<br>
<br>
All I can say is that some children admire their parents to the point that they 
are intimidated by them. At some point, many sons do not think that they can 
even converse with their father until they have proven themselves an equal.<br>
<br>
Unable to achieve the success of their parent in the field of that parent in the 
short term, they will try to be quickly successful in an endeavour where the 
parent has not succeeded. <br>
<br>
Daughters (I have siblings) may even be worse. If they cannot impress their 
father with their own achievements they will find a male friend who either 
impresses or challenges their parent, whether or not they are indeed their own 
friend.<br>
<br>
It may sound simplistic, but all this commotion may be only a prelude to a 
dialogue?<br>
<br>
<br>
-- peter</p>
<p><i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Fair comment. There's been limited dialogue, not through lack of effort. 
He's been closed and I'm cautious about pushing him too hard. I've given an 
occasional trial stronger prod, but he needs (and wants) to drive his own life. 
I've a great relationship with my daughter (though there were challenges with 
her too), which is something of a relief -- when you've problems with a child 
you start to doubt your parenting abilities.</i></p>
<hr>

<p>One part of the psyche tells one, &quot;Spare the rod, spoil the boy&quot;. But there 
is always a danger of building a strong and irrational reactance, which seems to 
already be a part of the case here. <br>
<br>
Tactful handling of persons is your forte, and I can give no advice to you on 
that count, which you are not already aware of. But at some point, I suppose one 
has to reflect upon the fact that humans are individual creatures, are free, and 
when they realise that what they are doing is not what they want to do, they 
rebel.<br>
<br>
I convinced someone very close to me to stop smoking, more than a year ago. But 
because of a ham-handed and authoritative approach later on, I managed to make 
her extremely defensive, angry, and inclined to do the very thing I had asked 
her not to, even though she really didn't feel like she needed to do it anymore, 
even by her own admission. <br>
<br>
I suppose the best sort of change is that which comes from within. Our job is 
just to help that change come. And sometimes, perhaps, accept that we cannot 
change things. <br>
<br>
-- I Vassarion<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Agreed. It's a delicate game and easy to trip even after it seems won. It 
can be a big problem where they think they know what you are thinking, but are 
completely wrong. </i></p>
