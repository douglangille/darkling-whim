<p><i>Wednesday 09-April-08</i><h2>Words of wisdom</h2>
<p>Wisdom is in surprisingly short supply in our modern, mixed-up world, and it 
seems most in need where it should be found the most: in the governments of 
great nations and in the governance of powerful companies.</p>
<p>Seeking wisdom is an endless journey. It has been said that the wise person 
does not think him or herself wise. To do would be to declare the journey done. 
I don't know if there is even a complete description of wisdom, so I'll take the 
simple description of 'knowing the right thing to say and do', although 'right' 
itself is a philosophical labyrinth. Wisdom seems to have a lot to do with 
people and a lot to do with meaning. I think.</p>
<p>Below are three of the most famous and maybe most wise exhortations for 
living a good life, joined here in parallel so we can look across and seek 
perhaps some common and even deeper meaning. <br>
&nbsp;</p>

  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="36%">Go placidly amid the noise and haste,<br>
    and remember what peace there may be in silence.<br>
    As far as possible without surrender<br>
    be on good terms with all persons.<br>
    Speak your truth quietly and clearly;<br>
    and listen to others,<br>
    even the dull and the ignorant;<br>
    they too have their story.
    <p>Avoid loud and aggressive persons,<br>
    they are vexations to the spirit.<br>
    If you compare yourself with others,<br>
    you may become vain and bitter;<br>
    for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.<br>
    Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. </p>
    <p>Keep interested in your own career, however humble;<br>
    it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.<br>
    Exercise caution in your business affairs;<br>
    for the world is full of trickery.<br>
    But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;<br>
    many persons strive for high ideals;<br>
    and everywhere life is full of heroism. </p>
    <p>Be yourself.<br>
    Especially, do not feign affection.<br>
    Neither be cynical about love;<br>
    for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment<br>
    it is as perennial as the grass. </p>
    <p>Take kindly the counsel of the years,<br>
    gracefully surrendering the things of youth.<br>
    Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.<br>
    But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.<br>
    Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.<br>
    Beyond a wholesome discipline,<br>
    be gentle with yourself. </p>
    <p>You are a child of the universe,<br>
    no less than the trees and the stars;<br>
    you have a right to be here.<br>
    And whether or not it is clear to you,<br>
    no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. </p>
    <p>Therefore be at peace with God,<br>
    whatever you conceive Him to be,<br>
    and whatever your labors and aspirations,<br>
    in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. </p>
    <p>With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,<br>
    it is still a beautiful world.<br>
    Be cheerful.<br>
    Strive to be happy. <br>

    <td valign="top" width="33%">Yet here, Laertes! Aboard, aboard for shame!<br>
    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail, And you are stay'd for.<br>
    There ... my blessing with thee!<br>
    And these few precepts in thy memory.<br>
    &nbsp;<p>Look thou character. <br>
    Give thy thoughts no tongue, Nor any unproportion'd 
    thought his act.<br>
    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.</p>
    <p>Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, <br>
    Grapple them to thy soul 
    with hoops of steel; <br>
    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment <br>
    Of each 
    new-hatch'd, unfledg?d comrade.<br>
    <br>
    Beware of entrance to a quarrel but, being 
    in, <br>
    Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.<br>
    <br>
    Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice; <br>
    Take each man's censure, but 
    reserve thy judgement.<br>
    <br>
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,<br>
    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy; <br>
    For the apparel oft proclaims 
    the man; <br>
    And they in France of the best rank and station <br>
    Are of a most 
    select and generous chief in that.<br>
    <br>
    Neither a borrower, nor a lender be;<br>
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend, <br>
    And borrowing dulls the edge of 
    husbandry.<br>
    <br>
    This above all: to thine own self be true, <br>
    And it must follow, as the night 
    the day, <br>
    Thou canst not then be false to any man.<br>
    <br>
    Farewell; my blessing season this in thee!</p>

    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br>
    If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you<br>
    But make allowance for their doubting too,<br>
    If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
    Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,<br>
    Or being hated, don't give way to hating,<br>
    And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:<br>
    If you can dream--and not make dreams your master,<br>
    If you can think--and not make thoughts your aim;<br>
    If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
    And treat those two impostors just the same;<br>
    If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken<br>
    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>
    Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
    And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:
    <p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
    And risk it all on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>
    And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
    And never breath a word about your loss;<br>
    If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
    To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br>
    And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
    Except the Will which says to them: &quot;Hold on!&quot; </p>
    <p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>
    Or walk with kings--nor lose the common touch,<br>
    If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;<br>
    If all men count with you, but none too much,<br>
    If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
    With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,<br>
    Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,<br>
    And--which is more--you'll be a Man, my son! </p>

What do you take from this? A few common themes that resonate with me 
include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be happy in your own skin.</li>
  <li>Do not burden others.</li>
  <li>Have integrity.</li>
  <li>See truth.</li>
  <li>Persist.</li>
  <li>Love.</li>
  <li>Be.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mmm. Sounds about right.</p>

<h2 align="center">Your comments</h2>

<p>I stumbled upon this...very wise words indeed! <br>
<br>
-- April</p>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;I was very happy to find this site. I was researching the word 
bystander to determine if I wanted to use the word bystander or onlooker in a
recent blog post. I found the article on the bystander effect and felt a 
little better about humanity. </p>
<p>I was recently a first responder to a very bad car accident. I was with my 
two daughters . I pulled over and immediately ran to the car to assist. I was 
the only one there for a moment. The car had spun and flipped, but had landed 
upright. the doors were locked, and I had to get the driver to \&quot;come to\&quot; 
enough to unlock the door. I had never seen something so terrible. Her head had 
hit the windshield and she literally looked like Frankenstein. Soon other cars 
stopped. I was literally jumping up and down, crying for others to help, then 
began attending to her. I calmed myself enough to keep her calm. I braced her 
head and neck. I practice Reiki, so I said a quick prayer and let the energy 
flow. She had broken ribs, broken ankle and a serious head trauma. Not one other 
person came to help. Not one. I yelled for one to call her husband, and he did. 
But no one helped me with the difficult stuff.</p>
<p>I couldn't believe it. I really believe in the golden rule. I use it as a 
guide, and I think the world would be a completely different place if we all 
took it to heart. So I guess what I experienced was the Bystander Effect.<br>
<br>
Thank you for this site. I plan to come here often. Lots of good practical 
advice. I added it to my list of favorite sites on my blog. kudos!<br>
<br>
Gratefully,<br>
Gloria I</p>

<p>I think wisdom rests on more than one base, but one prerequisite is an 
understanding of the emotions which can so easily sabotage it. I have too many 
thoughts about emotions to type here, but I have posted them as an e-book at
<a href="http://www.wanterfall.com">www.wanterfall.com</a> (free to read online 
or download, as preferred). Maybe it will prove helpful to someone - hope so:)
</p>
<p>Best wishes, <br>
Gordon<br>
<br>
<i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Very thoughtful and generous of you, Gordon. For everyone else, I'd 
thoroughly recommend reading Gordon's (truly free) book. What he doesn't mention 
here is that he's a medical doctor with a superb pedigree, and knows what he's 
talking about.</i></p>
