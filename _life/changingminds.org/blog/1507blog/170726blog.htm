<p><i>Sunday 26-July-15</i><h2>Seventeen rules for being a good husband and 
keeping your wife happy</h2>
<p>There are lots of amusing articles out there about men, women and the gulfs 
between them. Both genders cast their eyes upwards and perhaps grin ruefully 
when they contemplate the mysteries and foolishness of the opposite sex. Sure, 
we're different and it does no harm to make light of this. But what about 
writing something more practical? Dating has been done to death, so how about 
that less fashionable thing: marriage. I can speak with some authority on this, 
having been happily married for several decades. </p>
<p>So, in no particular order, here are some&nbsp;rules for husbands, or how to keep your wife by 
keeping her happy year after year. I can't say I always use them or they always 
work, but I can say I do try and we're still very happily married.</p>
<h3>1. Treat her like a lady </h3>
<p>It may seem old fashioned, but unless she's a determined feminist, she'll 
like it when you do things like opening doors for her, helping her on with her 
coat, and pretty much always putting her first. </p>
<p>Women like to feel special. They want to know you respect them and would 
never hurt them. Being a gentleman is a good way to show this. </p>
<h3>2. Surprise her </h3>
<p>Randomly buy flowers, take her to a swanky restaurant, buy her a random 
present or otherwise treat her to something nice. It needn't be expensive, 
though an occasional splash will go a long way. </p>
<p>Surprise changes minds. It 
delights. It shows that the flame of romance is still burning. Surprise is, by 
definition, unexpected, so keep mixing it up and being creative. </p>
<h3>3. Push the boat out</h3>
<p>Now and again, do something expensive together. Push the boat out. Go to an 
expensive restaurant. Go on holiday to some exotic location. Buy her an 
expensive anniversary present. </p>
<p>Yes, you always need to manage the money, so save 
up for occasional such splurges. These can be done as surprises but often are 
fun to plan together. Initiate the process, then give her options and let her 
choose. </p>
<h3>4. Make her laugh</h3>
<p>Laughter comes from incongruous surprise. Tell jokes. Be funny. Clown around. 
When she thinks of you, she should smile inside. Playing the fool also says you 
trust her not to take advantage of your idiocy. </p>
<p>Fun may exists on the edge of acceptability, so be careful not to tread into 
dangerous waters (for example with gender jokes). It may mean taking risks so 
learn where her boundaries are and respect them.</p>
<h3>5. Defend her </h3>
<p>Women like to feel safe, and as the weaker sex easily feel more vulnerable 
than men. If somebody attacks her, verbally or otherwise, stand up for her. If 
necessary, put yourself at risk. She'll love you for your courage. If you seem 
willing to put yourself in harm's way for her, you must surely love her above 
all else. </p>
<p>This does not mean attacking every man who looks at her or jumping in with 
both feet when you hear part of a comment. Find out what's going on before 
sticking your neck out. Conversational interruptions can embarrass her. 
Aggression, even to others, can scare her. Listening then subtly defusing the 
situation can sometimes be best. Always remember your goal is her comfort, not 
to massage your own manliness. </p>
<h3>6. Help out </h3>
<p>If things need doing around the house, do them. If dishes need washing, wash 
them. If there are bits on the floor, pick them up. If a tap is dripping, fix 
it. In particular, watch for when she looks tired and offer to help out. Suggest 
that you cook, clean or just make a cup of coffee. Be tidy. Put things away 
rather than down.</p>
<p>Certainly, you may each take on different roles where you each attend to 
different chores, and do respect her preferences (some women, for example, like 
cooking and consider the kitchen their domain). Do not take helping to extreme. 
It is important to share the work and she may resent you if you do too much (or 
may just take you for granted). You goal is that she appreciates you, not 
wonders what you are up to. </p>
<h3>7. Touch her</h3>
<p>Maintain regular, affectionate physical contact. Touch her lightly on the 
shoulder as you go past. Come up behind her and hug her around the waist. 
Especial when she has been away, even for the day, welcome her back with a smile 
and a big hug. </p>
<p>Be careful in this to keep contact appropriate. If she sometimes seems not to 
want to be touched, back off. Sometimes women don't want physical contact or not 
in certain ways. Respect this. Your touch should make her feel good, not pawed.
</p>
<h3>8. Tell her you love her</h3>
<p>Declare your love for her. Tell her this on cards and gifts or just in words, 
at random time of the day. Always remember Valentine's Day, your wedding 
anniversary and any other special dates. </p>
<h3>9. Say she looks good </h3>
<p>Stop mid-tracks now and again, look at her and say something like 'Gosh, you 
look great'. Smile appreciatively when you look at her. Notice when she's 
dressed up and say that she looks great. Also say she looks good when she isn't 
spruced up. If she denies this, say something like 'You can't help always 
looking good.' </p>
<p>When she tries on a dress and asks your opinion, if you don't like it don't 
say she looks awful -- say you prefer another dress today or the shade isn't 
quite right. Beware of painting yourself into a corner by saying things like 
'You look nice now' that imply she doesn't at other times.</p>
<h3>10. Show your appreciation</h3>
<p>Find other ways to show you appreciate her. An easy way is to smile and thank 
her when she does things for you. Say what a great wife she is. Tell her the 
best decision of your life was to marry her. Tell others she's brilliant (it 
will likely get back to her). Never criticize her to other people.</p>
<p>When she shows she appreciates you, show that you like this by saying things 
like 'That's very kind of you'. When you are both showing appreciation for the 
other on a regular basis, it a make a lot of difference all round.</p>
<h3>11. Take her seriously </h3>
<p>The most common indicator of impending divorce is contempt. The opposite is 
respect. Show her respect by listening to her concerns and treating these as 
being important, even if they they don't seem that big a deal to you. Don't just 
nod and hope she'll finish soon. Read between the lines and look for underlying 
concerns. Sometimes listening and appreciating is all she needs. At other times 
she wants help. When this is obvious, just do it. If you are not sure, ask. </p>
<p>This can be difficult when she is critical of you. Don't just react angrily 
or defensively. Stay open to the possibility that things you do aren't as 
effective as they could be. In many ways she is your customer. Think carefully 
and objectively about what is going on. Discuss alternatives and, if needed, 
change. She'll know this is a big deal for you (if not, explain how you feel) 
and will be very appreciative. </p>
<h3>12. Be the calm one</h3>
<p>Be the calm one, but not the cold one. When she gets upset, neither go up in 
the air with her, nor be clinical. Empathize with her emotion. Listen to her 
explanation, no matter how illogical it is. Then decide what to do. Often, all 
she needs is comfort. </p>
<p>Sometimes it helps to tell her everything will turn out ok. At other times 
some helpful suggestions work (though at other times they do not). Another 
approach is to take charge and sort out the problem yourself, though you may 
want to ask if she wants this. Finally cool logic can work, though it is often 
best left until she feels a bit calmer. </p>
<h3>13. Criticize carefully </h3>
<p>When you interact with her, you gain and spend points. 
When you criticize, for no matter how small an issue, you spend points, and 
probably more than you think. If she does something that you thing wrong, be 
openly curious rather than coldly critical. Say something like 'How interesting. 
What makes you think that?' Then accept her logic rather than using the answer 
as proof of her stupidity. People see things in different ways. One way forward 
is to ask 'Can I offer a challenge?' If she sounds unhappy (even if she says 
yes) then don't make a big deal of it. Maybe start your challenge with 'I was 
wondering...' and then don't press your argument too hard. Even if you don't 
take things further, she will likely have got the message. Giving her a 
respectable way out is often a good thing.</p>
<p>When you say and do nice things, you gain points. 
It is important to understand the economics of this system and always to stay in 
credit. A simple rule of thumb is that one small complaint is worth five to ten 
nice comments. </p>
<p>Choose which hills you'll die on. Some issues will be very important to you, 
so much so you are ready to argue long and strongly about them. Make sure these 
are few. </p>
<h3>14. Moan minimally</h3>
<p>While nowhere near as significant as criticism, moaning also costs you points 
which need to be repaid. The price of a moan is based on how emotionally 
draining your whinges are, not how big a deal they are for you. You can help 
yourself here by playing down the importance to you of issues like the problems 
that idiot at work is causing you. </p>
<p>It is important for each to share their troubles, but you don't have to make 
a song and dance over it, even if she does. There are exceptions to this in 
human upsets like death in the family, but a good rule of thumb for everyday 
ills is restraint. </p>
<h3>15. Forgive her </h3>
<p>There'll be a ton of stuff she does that bugs you. She'll leave doors open, 
not put bottle tops on properly, drive erratically and all sorts of things that 
will frustrate the socks off you. </p>
<p>You can tell, ask or plead with her a hundred times and she may still do 
them. So in the end you have to decide if any of this is worth the worry, anger 
or general stress. Very largely, it isn't. Much easier is to accept that this is 
how she is, forgive her her foibles and quietly close the doors, put things away 
and so on. It may be she does the same for you. </p>
<p>Do your best to avoid blame. Blame assumes the person is bad and deserve 
punishment. It makes you judge, jury and executioner. It invites them to blame 
you in return. It leads to resentment, revenge and other bad stuff, and before 
long you have a long feud. It's better assume human mistakes, forgetfulness or 
other good reason you don't yet understand. You get what you give. Give good 
stuff, it's better for everyone.</p>
<h3>16. Never take her for granted </h3>
<p>It is so easy to start taking things for granted when you get married. With 
pressures of work and cultural expectations, it is easy to mentally put her in 
the position of 'wife', which can also imply 'housekeeper', ' possession', 
'mother', and so on. </p>
<p>Treat her like she's a girlfriend or even a prospective one. Be the romantic, 
smitten suitor. When you look at her, remember when you first felt like this and 
bring that feeling back. Go on dates. Catch her eye and smile, deeply. Hold her 
hand on walks. Make her feel special, always. </p>
<h3>17. Do authentic experiments </h3>
<p>Be authentic. Mean what you say and do. If her experience so far hasn't been 
great for her, be patient. Build steadily rather than smothering her.<br>
</p>
<p>All of the above practices work for me and I still assiduously use them 
(and mean them). Many are likely to work for you, though perhaps in different 
quantities. When you do something, watch how she reacts. Does she seem pleased? 
Does she freak out? Find out why and adjust accordingly. Add and subtract 
things. Change the details. Try new stuff. </p>
<h2>In summary </h2>
<p>If you can't remember or aren't sure about some of these points, do remember 
two critical things that most women want, which is strength and kindness. Show 
strength in making her feel safe and secure. Show kindness in attention, 
appreciation and care. </p>
<p>Marriage is a partnership which has to work for both of you, though this can 
easily mean you each feel you are doing more than your fair share. One's own 
effort often seems more significant than that of others -- after all, only you 
feel the effort involved. If you still think things are unbalanced, discuss this 
with her and find a way forward. Talk is the gateway to understanding and 
resolution. </p>
<p>If you aren't married, then you may also find these points useful. If you get 
married, keep them always in mind. It is so easy for things to slip once you 
feel the relationship is permanent and cannot change.</p>
<p>Remember: Your goal is her happiness and appreciation. Find what works and 
keep it up.</p>
