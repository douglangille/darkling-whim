<p><i>Sunday 14-June-09</i><h2>A Virgin failure (and recovery)</h2>
<p>What do you do when you experience a service failure? Many people do nothing, 
which is sad, because it means many more people will be affected. I've just had 
a rather dreadful experience at the hands of Virgin, a company I have previously 
admired. I've send a copy of this blog to the CEO.<br>

      <p><br>
      Dear Sir Richard</p>
      <p><br>
      Ever since I bought Tubular Bells whilst a student in 1973 I have followed 
      the admirable development of Virgin. As a later student and practitioner 
      in business I have also read your books and admired your inspirational 
      leadership. It is therefore with regret that I must report a lamentable 
      and repeated lapse in service by Virgin Balloon Flights. My faith in this 
      company has been so shaken, I am writing to you directly. Some of the 
      failures below may seem small to you, but they were all instrumental.</p>
      <p><br>
      My wife bought me a balloon ride as a special present, which gave me 
      months of delighted anticipation before I decided to book the flight this 
      month. I phoned the number in the letter and got through to someone who 
      told me that the booking people were busy but someone would phone back. 
      Nobody did. (<font color="#FF0000">First failure</font>). I consequently 
      found the website and was able to book online, so I thought it would be 
      ok. </p>
      <p><br>
      It was rather worrying that when booking the flight, there was no 
      indication of flight time -- only AM or PM (<font color="#FF0000">Second 
      failure</font>). </p>
      <p><br>
      In the information after booking and in the identical email received, 
      there was an instruction to phone 'from 11pm the night before your 
      flight'. Please note the 'from' and the omission of 'between' hours. (<font color="#FF0000">Third 
      failure</font>).</p>
      <p><br>
      Now I work long hours, getting up early for a 2 hour commute into London. 
      By 10pm and often earlier, I am out for the count. I worried about the 
      ambiguous instruction but resolved to get up early to find the flight 
      details. I rose before 6am and called the number, only to find that I was 
      supposed to be in Henley, about 20 minutes away, for 6am. I called the 
      emergency number given, only to get a message saying that this was an old 
      number and telling me to call another number, which I did, only for it to 
      ring and ring with no answer (<font color="#FF0000">Fourth failure</font>).</p>
      <p><br>
      As you might guess, I was very disappointed by this. It was a perfect 
      morning. I am a keen photographer and the light was just right. </p>
      <p><br>
      I called the main Virgin Balloons number to find that it opened at 10am. I 
      called back then and told my story to the person, only to be cut off as I 
      completed it. I called again and spoke to somebody else, who persisted in 
      telling me things that I should have done, like phone after 11pm. This is 
      a dreadful method: when a customer is unhappy, telling them what they 
      should have done will only make them more unhappy (<font color="#FF0000">Fifth 
      failure</font>). </p>
      <p><br>
      She told me that she would investigate, but warned that I would lose any 
      future opportunity if the pilot confirmed that the flight took place. I 
      had already told her it was a beautiful day and this only served to 
      frustrate me further, though I bit my lip and just asked her not to tell 
      me all the things I should have done, but to tell me what she was going to 
      do about it. She said she would call back the same day and I gave her two 
      numbers for this, asking her to leave a message at my home number if she 
      couldn't get through on the mobile (I had by now gone out for the day to 
      cheer up). By now, I was not surprised that when I got home there was no 
      message. (<font color="#FF0000">Sixth failure</font>). </p>
      <p><br>
      Will they get back to me? Experience says no, and my faith in Virgin 
      Balloon Flights has so completely shaken, I am writing directly to you.</p>
      <p><br>
      I have wondered if any of it was my fault. The service representative told 
      me that there was indication of times in the brochure, which I later found 
      to be true. But consider the customer journey here. I read the booklet 
      last Christmas, but when booking the flight only referred to the letter 
      enclosed with the booklet and the information I saw online and received in 
      the subsequent email. In no place along this recent route was there any 
      indication of actual or potential flight times.</p>
      <p><br>
      In 'Business Stripped Bare' you state as your proposition that '<i>we 
      offer our customers a Virgin experience, and we make sure that this Virgin 
      experience is a substantial and consistent one, across all sectors of our 
      business</i>'. I believe you. I believe this is what you intend, and that 
      my experience with Virgin Balloon Flights is an exception. I will ask 
      three things of you to demonstrate this: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>That I get the sunny flight that my wife intended for me.</li>
        <li>That you fix the failures listed, so others will not suffer 
        likewise.</li>
        <li>That you fix the system that led to these failures.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><br>
      In this, I would ask that your service representatives are not punished, 
      but that they are properly trained in handling unhappy customers. I would 
      also suggest that you do a detailed process review, examining in detail 
      the customer's experiential journey, particularly when things go wrong. 
      Customer experience design is critical for many modern businesses, along 
      with the process, technology and organisation that create this. As a core 
      element of your brand, I do hope you have a strong and deep competence in 
      this area.</p>
      <p><br>
      Many thanks for you kind consideration and I await your response with 
      interest,</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</td>

  <p align="left">Virgin did a decent recovery, which is good. I didn't speak to 
  Richard Branson but I think it was someone high-up, who called to thank me for 
  my suggestions, saying they agreed with many of these and would be 
  implementing them. And of course I would have my balloon flight reinstated.<p align="left">
  My faith in Virgin is thus restored. It doesn't take much to recover a 
  customer, even a very unhappy one. All you need to do is show that you care, 
  listen intelligently, and do the right thing.</div>
