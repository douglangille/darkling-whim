<p><i>Friday 04-July-08</i><h2>Micromanagement </h2>
<p>There is a style of management with which many are familiar and which has 
acquired the name 'micromanagement'. The manager in question acts as if the 
subordinate is incapable of doing the job, giving close instruction and checking 
everything the person does. They seldom praise and often criticise. Whatever 
their subordinates do, nothing seems good enough. </p>
<p>For the individual, this tends to be incredibly frustrating. They are being 
treated as if they are incapable and untrustworthy. We often see ourselves as 
others see us and, when treated as unworthy, we will soon <i>feel</i> unworthy. 
In this way, people who are micromanaged can become dependent, unable to make 
the smallest decision without asking their manager. Alternatives to this total 
submission, which many take, include remaining frustrated or leaving. In any 
case, it is easy for one's confidence to be severely knocked. </p>
<p>Why do managers micromanage? There can be a number of reasons. First, they 
may reasonably not trust the person either because there is evidence to support 
this or because the newness of the relationship has not yet yielded evidence to 
support trust. There might also be a high-risk situation which merits extra 
management attention. </p>
<p>A more likely explanation is an internal need for the manager to manage 
closely. They may fear failure personally, transfer that risk to the person then 
take ownership of the person's work. The manager may also feel (or want to feel) 
superior to the person, effectively confusing authority with ability. The person 
thus seems incompetent and the manager looks for confirmation of this in the 
smallest details of the person's work. A minor error is thus taken as evidence 
of the person's total incompetence and the manager's obvious superiority. This 
can be a reversal of a childhood situation with a critical parent. Just as the 
abused become abusers, so also may the criticised become critical. </p>
<p>Micromanagement also plays to strong identity and control needs. Telling 
people what to do and not do is a strong 
<a href="../../explanations/needs/control.htm">controlling</a> action, whilst 
the sense of superiority strokes the <a href="../../explanations/needs/identity.htm">
identity</a> ego. </p>
<p>So what should you do when faced with a micromanager? The first thing is to 
recognise that it is <i>their</i> issue, not yours. However, this disability 
means they lack certain abilities and because of your situation, you are going 
to have to handle it. The simplest approach is to listen patiently and 
attentively when they tell you what to do (they hate being ignored). If you 
really disagree with what they are saying, ask politely for their reasons or 
explain your concern and ask for their advice. Quietly and carefully ensure you 
cannot be blamed for the micromanager's decisions (it can be useful to keep 
notes in case of later disagreement).</p>
<p>You can give them feedback (through a third party, if necessary) about how 
they are behaving and how this makes you feel. Some micromanagers do not intend 
to act this way and will make genuine attempts to improve. Many, however, will 
feel slighted and the result can be unhelpful. In consequence, think carefully 
before using this approach. </p>
<p>A reversal can be an interesting alternative, effectively, micromanaging 
them. Book their time to agree what you will be doing. Agree in detail what you 
will be doing. Let them make every decision. Then do exactly what they said and 
report back that you have done it. Go back often to check for new each decision. 
In the end they may tire of your constant attention and tell you to back off. 
You can also pre-empt and prompt this by occasionally asking if your approach to 
managing the detail through them is ok and whether they'd prefer you to decide 
more things yourself.</p>
<p>Another approach is to use their control and identity needs as levers. Use 
these as punishment and reward, carefully removing control and isolating them, 
or giving feedback that shows they are in control and are wonderful. For example 
when they over-control, avoid them, whilst when they give you more space, even a 
little, look at them and smile (identity stroking). Be very subtle in all this 
-- if the micromanager feels micromanaged, they will react strongly. </p>
<p>In this way you will feel more in control yourself even as you give them a 
greater sense of control. Living with a micromanager need not be painful and it 
can be an interesting challenge.</p>

<h2 align="center">Your comments</h2>
<hr>
<p align="left">&nbsp;Thanks for this post. You have described my manager to a &quot;tee&quot;. 
Several of us have tried your suggestions, but she hasn't gotten the message. 
This particular manager can also become a rage-a-holic on occasion. I feel very 
disempowered and discouraged in this job.<br>
<br>

<br>
<i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Another approach is to organise, for example going en masse to HR. Gather 
evidence. Get witnesses. Read up on employment law. Sometimes also, if you can, 
the best response is to look for another job. </i></p>
<hr>

<p align="left">&nbsp;Yeah, I told my manager my opinion and she simply replied that 
&quot;this is not going to work&quot; - meant us working together. I think that copying 
her on every email I send (over 60 emails a day and coworkers refuse to email me 
because they know she reads everything) to asking MY subordinates to email her 
with everything they forward to me. <br>
<br>
I cannot micromanage her - I tried that and it just made me look incompetent. 
Any suggestion? <br>
<br>
-- Terrified Team Leader From GA<br>
<br>
<i><b>Dave replies:</b><br>
There's a few options: fight back directly, escalate within the company, quit or 
just tolerate her. My approach in the past has been to quit, but then I've been 
lucky enough to know I can get another job. A variant is moving within the 
company.</i></p>
<hr>

<p align="left">&nbsp;My Senior Manager tells me that I am a micromanager because I 
like details. I am a manager of a team of 20 in a call center for an online 
university. I do like details, but mainly for my own comfort. I rarely use the 
details, such as how many transfers my employees make turn to appointments then 
enrolments by an admissions advisor, to confront an employee. Instead I see the 
info and it shows me who is effective and who needs more coaching. I am a 
stickler for professionalism, attendance/timeliness, not using slang, dress 
code, and rebutting to objections. However, I don't feel that this makes me a 
micro-manager, I just want to be a facilitator and have everyone know and do the 
basics without acting like little kids trying to get around the rules. I find 
myself always having to nitpick about attendance with an employee because our 
company policy says if you are more than three minutes late then you get an 
occurrence (after 3 you are gone) the company mandates that part timers be on 
the phone 3:30 of their day and full timers 7:20, anything less and I am 
supposed to reprimand them. When I do so, I am called a micromanager and told 
that other managers will give them leeway.<br>
<br>
So, I ask you &quot;am I a micromanager and just don't know it?&quot; If I am, &quot;how can I 
fix it?&quot;<br>
<br>
~Confused manager or micromanager? <br>
<br>
-- David C</p>
<p align="left"><br>
<i><u>Dave replies:</u><br>
Liking detail and being a micromanager are worlds apart. Micromanagement is 
about the personal control needs of the manager who does not trust his or her 
people. It is about the way individuals are demotivated, not motivated, by 
constant over-the-shoulder corrections. If the rules you are playing to are 
different from other managers then, by contrast, you may appear to be 
micro-managing. The challenge for you is to ask yourself how, in a culture you 
probably can't change alone, how can you motivate your people to give of their 
best. </i></p>
<p align="left"><i>Reprimanding is a tricky area, when it comes to motivation 
and can easily just make matters worse. One approach is to frame it as a joint 
problem -- a part of your job is to ensure the rules are followed, so what can 
we do? (note the 'we'). </i></p><hr>
<p>In our office there are two female young supervisors who are definitely need 
more supervisory skills training; apparently they have attended a class, but to 
no avail, have they changed. Our staff are not allowed to leave the area unless 
we email our supervisor every time we leave our desk area and return when we 
return back to our desk, we can not ask for any assistance from a co-worker or 
ask a co-worker a job related question, we must email a supervisor every time we 
are leaving and returning from lunch; our supervisor is new from another area, 
but she refuses to take our suggestions on how to help the court run better, she 
wants to make changes that we tell her are not possible for judiciary reasons. 
AND LORD FORBID THAT SHE CATCHES YOU TALKING TO YOUR WORK NEIGHBORS.<br>
<br>
WOULD THIS BE MICRO-MANAGING??? <br>
<br>
-- Ms Sal<br>
<br>
<br>
<i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>It sounds pretty much like it, although many micromanagers tend to more to 
check up on you and tell you more about the detail what to do, as well as make 
you ask permission for everything. It's a control thing and your supervisors 
sound like they have high control needs and satisfy them by demotivating their 
subordinates, which isn't really that good for business, is it?</i></p>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;I can't imagine having to email my boss every time you have to leave your 
work area. I feel for you. <br>
<br>
-- Janelle</p><hr>
<p>to david c you are a total micro manager. The online university business 
allows for leeway within the rules. other directors do it and you know it. This 
is a sales position not rewarding those who do well with some sort of autonomy 
will cause them to not enroll. This is due to the fact that thier mood will be 
considerably down and in sales that is a very important factor. Im guessing by 
now you have no job as im sure your team quit on you and turnover is so high in 
for profit education. <br>
<br>
-- derick</p>
<hr>
<p>I feel that most people don't require micromanagement; but there are always 
those who do. In some cases, it cannot be avoided. We have a manager who allows 
us to do our work, on our own, and get the job done. Then, there are people who 
abuse lunch hours, say they are going to the field and end up out shopping, that 
kind of thing. The field in which I work requires some of the workers to visit 
clients in their homes... so I feel these people almost have to be 
micro-managed. The boss is beginning to crack down on these situations. </p>

<p><i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Whilst micromanagement is more often a problem with the manager, there are 
indeed people who need close supervision. This is one of the principles of

<hr>
<p>i am a supervisor. i use to have a business like the one i work for. i know 
more than my administrator/owner on the business. i know all the regs and 
policies and usually everybody from staff refer to me for advise and direction 
including my immediate supervisor and the owner/administrator. the administrator 
is starting to micromanage and is asking for reports. i have same work as 
everybody plus my supervisor duties and indirectly helping with the management 
of the whole office. the reason i say indirectly is because my immediate 
supervisor ask me for advise. lately i heard a counseling/writeup is on the way. 
apparently for not keeping up with the report of the people directly under me. 
how can i respond to that counseling/writeup? thanks. i love my job but lately 
its been very stressful for the whole office including my immediate supervisor.

<p><i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Oh I feel for you! To know something better than the boss (and worse, to 
have been the boss) and find that they not only don't appreciate you but think 
you are so incapable that you must be micromanaged.&nbsp; I don't know what to 
advise, but it sounds like the problem is with the owner. Maybe you can talk 
with your supervisor to figure out what to do. It's also possible that you're 
giving them what you know they need but not what they think they need. All I can 
suggest is to first talk and listen, then decide whether you want to continue 
there. If you have to stay for personal reasons, then you'll also have to find a 
way to make it work.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;I feel that most people don't require micromanagement; but there area 
always who do. In some cases, it cannot be avoided. We have a manager who allows

<p><i><b>Dave replies:</b><br>
Micromanagement is a substitute for trust. If you cannot trust people, it can be 
because they are not trustworthy or you have difficulty in trusting them. Figure 
this one out first, before concluding that closer management is needed.</i></p>

<p>I am a Supervisor, My Employer is funded from an agency, and is totally 
voluntary. The Community dev. Office in Charge of the Funding is totally 
micro-managing me as a supervisor and my employer. I have being working with the 
same agency over 15 years and never had a problem, until this new person was 
allocated to us due to the previous persons retirement, I am totally stressed 
out, and as you say this makes you feel worthless and useless while you are 
being put down on a continues basis. Her bosses are turning a blind eye on how 
she does her business, and thus this is being pursued by The Employer and Union. 
I do hope this will be addressed soon, so I can do my job to its perfection. </p>
