<p><i>Wednesday 21-May-08</i><h2>Teenage turnaround </h2>
<p>I've written an occasional blog over the past year or so about the trials and 
tribulations with my teenage son. It's a common problem, it seems, and I've had 
many sympathetic and helpful communications on the subject with people around 
the world. This update is, at last, hopeful and positive. </p>
<p>The critical event was, perhaps predictably, getting a job. I noticed that a 
local <a href="http://www.tesco.com/">Tesco</a> store was extending and looking 
for new staff so my wife took him along and he got an offer to work on the new 
meat counter. Nothing to set the world alight, maybe, but it was full-time and 
more than shelf-stacking. </p>
<p>He'd not lasted in other jobs and we'd learned not to expect much, yet we 
were still hopeful. Tesco is the leading grocer in the UK and is known as a 
meritocracy where those who do well can find a good career. </p>
<p>Almost immediately we noticed a change in him. He came home cheerful and 
actually chatted to us about how he was getting on. He completed his training in 
record time at a nearby store and helped out with the setup of the new store. 
When others were late he took over their roles. He arrived at work early and was 
never in a hurry to leave. </p>
<p>He has been there a month now and has already been promoted to second in 
charge of the fresh food counters (fish, meat, cheese and deli). Last week he 
reorganised the store room, for which he got a commendation from the store 
manager, then spent time on his computer at home making signs to put on the 
shelves.</p>
<p>His evolution into full adulthood isn't complete yet and we still get some 
moodiness and outbursts, yet he has come on a long way in a short space of time. 
Where he goes in life is his choice and responsibility, though he could do a lot 
worse than stay with Tesco. They are known as a meritocracy and he has a lot of 
ability. Whatever he does, we have our fingers crossed for him.</p>

troubles over?</a></p>

<h2 align="center">Your comments</h2>

<hr>

<p>That is simply wonderful news! I am happy to hear this good news! <br>
<br>
-- Gene</p>
<hr>
<p>I was so pleased to hear this great news. Our son is currently going through 
the staying in his room playing computer games all day and all night phase and I 
was feeling absolutely desperate, and found your previous blog. It was wonderful 
to feel that we weren't alone, and even better to have some hope that things 
will change. No amount of cajoling or pleading will persuade him to apply for 
any jobs at present (he says he knows he won't like it so what's the point?) I 
don't know if we should just leave him alone, which is what he wants, because he 
regards any kind of offer to help as criticism. Like your son, he is a lovely, 
gentle, good, intelligent person and it's so painful to see him locking himself 
up in this prison of his own making. Your blog has given me hope that things 
will change. Do you think we should leave him alone or look for jobs for him in 
the hope one will turn up he might try?<br>
<br>
Thanks again and very best wishes for your family<br>
<br>

<i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Hi Lesley -- growing up is hard, especially for some. My son is not out of 
the woods yet -- he still has his sullen days, but he is slowly improving. Most 
importantly, he has held down the job and has even been promoted. </i></p>

<hr>

<p>Dave, thanks for sharing your story with us. I am going through a lot with my 
17yr old daughter right now. She just told me and her dad that she wanted to 
quit school because she is bored and that we cannot make her go. She says she 
wants to be a hairdresser and will get her GED and go to college. She is a 
senior with only 8 months to go. She does not have a lot of friends at school 
like she used to. She smokes pot but I think that is all the drugs she is doing 
now (isn't that enough?) We have always had a good relationship and she really 
is a nice kid who does bad things. Was wondering if anyone else had this problem 
and how they dealt with it.<br>
<br>
Thanks, Diane <br>
<br>
<i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Hi Diane. You are not alone. Your daughter sounds like a fine young lady who 
wants to develop a particular career. Given the fact of only 8 month left, 
perhaps you could incentivize her to stay on that period by promising to fund 
part of her hairdressing training if she stays the rest of the current course. 
One reason she may want to quit is if she fears she will disappoint you with 
less than perfect results. It's probably worth reassuring her around this. Also 
show her how completing her senior year will help with her future career. </i>
</p>
<p><i>One thing I've always tried to do with my kids is to show them reality and 
then respect their decisions when made with fair knowledge of the real costs and 
risks. I'm also careful not to dance after them with a safety net. I'll not 
always be there and it would only teach them to take even more risks. The 
reality checks they may get may be heart-stopping for you, but will help them 
learn and take responsibility.</i></p>
<p><i>Many kids smoke pot and as long as it's not excessive most also survive it 
just fine (otherwise many of our generation would not be as ok as they are now). 
Know the signs of it worsening and be vigilant, otherwise I'd suggest not 
worrying too much about this.</i></p>
