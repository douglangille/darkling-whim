<p><i>Thursday 16-April-09</i><h2>Set up to fail</h2>
<p>Have you ever been in a situation at work where you seem doomed to failure, 
whichever way you turn? The 'set-up-to-fail syndrome' is a known phenomenon 
whereby people get put into situations where it may appear on the face of it 
that they have a fair chance of success, yet the reality is that, no matter how 
talented they are, there is little real chance of succeeding.</p>
<p>An example of set-up-to-fail is where a manager is told to increase 
manufacturing productivity in a division where business is bad and, unbeknownst 
to her, there are worsening employee relations, increasing trade union militancy 
and an entrenched executive board who have already decided to make swingeing 
cuts. With so much change and chaos in the offing, tweaking manufacturing 
methods is going to meet with resistance at all levels. </p>
<p>So is it deliberate? Is it a power play to 'put you in your place' or to 
create reason for dismissal? The answer is 'sometimes'. More often it is caused 
by limited understanding in a broader context of systemic failure. </p>
<p>A typical situation is that a manager sees a tricky problem and, unable to 
understand the detail, cognitively simplifies it, leaving out crucial detail. 
They still realize the risk involved, however, and so pass on the hot potato to 
others. </p>
<p>An important lesson when you are offered a new job is to find out why the 
last person left. They may have realized they were on a losing wicket and quit 
before things went all pear-shaped. Ask about the detail of the work and decide 
whether it is do-able or whether it would be better to look elsewhere. .</p>

<p>Aaahhh - but then there is the delusions of grandeur we suffer - thinking we 
can succeed where others have failed. It is just so tempting. (I blogged about 
it in the context of the Susan Boyle Youtube vid) - fascinating... </p>
<p>-- Dennis</p>
<p><br>
<i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Well I guess we're all delusional to some extent. And isn't it grand when we 
sometimes surprise even ourselves at how things turn out. For the uninitiated,
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lp0IWv8QZY">Susan Boyle</a> is an 
orgdinary-looking 40-something who blew away Simon Cowell and the other 
'Britain's Got Talent' judges with a remarkable singing voice. Within a week, 
she's also a star on YouTube with over 20 million hits so far.</i></p>
<hr>

<p>I wonder if someone can help me...after doing a little research, I have now 
discovered that my manager is a transactional style manager. How do I know this? 
Because this website clearly laid out the characteristics of leaders versus 
managers, as well as transactional versus transformational management. I know 
what to call my enemy now. However, nowhere have I found any information about 
how to deal with this. </p>
<p>Here are the results of his style of management for me: He nick-picks my work 
to pieces, he watches my time reporting with an eagle eye, he questions just 
about everything I do and wants to know why I did this or that this way or that 
way. Last week, he grilled me for 20 minutes on an email that I HADN'T EVEN 
SENT!!! Yes, it feels like a flogging every time we meet to discuss my work. He 
will not listen to my suggestions, even though I am a 20-year veteran in my 
field, I have 3 degrees, and I teach my subject at a local community college. As 
a result of this, I am unmotivated, I have no hope of ever amounting to 
anything, I have no desire to do better, and I feel hopeless. These negative 
feelings have all grown as a result of his bullying management, and I can hardly 
bear it. I am even now looking for another position outside the company. </p>
<p>My work has always been exemplary, and now I feel like an uneducated, 
ignorant moron. Can you please help me deal with this horrid treatment??? How 
can I possibly stand up under what I consider oppressive treatment. On the other 
hand, proving this will be difficult, as he is quite the manipulator, and he is 
in the good graces of his manager. You might think that I'm exaggerating, but 
others are beginning to see him as he is. Please help me. </p>

<i><b>Dave replies<br>
</b>Pamela, I feel for you! You're not alone and many suffer this
<a href="../0807blog/080704blog.htm">micromanagement</a>. My wife has been 
teaching longer than her head of department has been alive, yet her HoD still 
likes to wisely go through lesson plans criticizing minor detail. There are 
several strategies you can take. The easiest if you're not in a hurry and are 
safe yourself is patience. Just wait and they'll eventually move on. Then of 
course there's 'cover your ass' protection, creating and keeping evidence of 
your performance, particularly if your manager seeks to blame you for his own 
failings. A neat method is to figure out his needs and play to them -- he seems 
to have strong <a href="../../explanations/needs/control.htm">control</a> needs 
so keep him well-informed as to what is going on. Test how he responds to 
flattery -- bullies often have <a href="../../explanations/needs/identity.htm">
identity</a> issues and propping them up can soften them. Bullies also are often 
cowards so watch for problems and opportunities here though beware of making an 
enemy of him unless you're sure of your way out. And indeed planning an exit 
yourself may be a valid way of handling the situation. </i></p>
<hr>

<p>&nbsp;I know EXACTLY how you feel. Take it from me: If your manager is going 
to be there for a while...GET OUT! You owe it to yourself to NOT put yourself 
through that every day. </p>
<p>I was one of many in a few years to hold my position. My manager preferred a 
stressful work environment, (I think because it made him feel more important.) 
It was like he would go out of his way to make things more stressful for 
everyone...pushing things to the last minute, throwing unnecessary curve balls 
at you, etc. Same behavior: nit-picking, questioning everything I did, 
manipulating things I did to seem wrong when ultimately they weren't...it sounds 
like you know what I'm talking about. </p>
<p>Ultimately, my confidence diminished and the stress got to me. I was a rock 
star at all past jobs, so I was trying extra hard to swing everything back in my 
favor. But, there wasn't much that could be done no matter how hard I tried. 
It's like he was determined, and I was just set up to fail. </p>
<p>I tried the &quot;cover your ass&quot; routine where I got everything I could in 
writing, etc. That just seemed to frustrate him when I showed I was right or he 
was contradicting himself, thus making him try harder. <br>
Work became a living hell. I was working 30+ hours overtime (not paid because it 
was salary), waking up with nightmares about work, gaining weight, started 
smoking, got temperamental toward my supportive fiance, and inches away from 
depression. I couldn't eat breakfast or lunch during the week. I got to where 
all I felt I could do was sit on a rock. I felt like my whole career and all my 
life choices were a mistake. I think I actually had a nervous breakdown. <br>
<br>
It felt like he smelled fresh blood, and pounced like a wolf, making life at 
work a real living hell. Finally, I realized it wasn't a choice to stay 
anymore...I had to leave because it was causing serious damage to my life. Even 
during the highest unemployment period in the last 40 years, with no job to go 
to. I worked out the departure to be on good terms. <br>
<br>
Needless to say, I ended up leaving. I still have nightmares about that job and 
I am still struggling with my lack of confidence.<br>
<br>
There's no way you'll be able to change your manager. Do you really think he 
will change for you? He has way more leverage on the decision makers / paycheck 
writers than you ever will. It's a loosing battle - why not work somewhere where 
your boss is open to your ideas, appreciates your hard work and wants to work 
with you to make sure you, them and the company are heading in a positive 
direction? <br>
<br>
I suggest you carefully screen your next manager before accepting a new job, I 
accepted mine without enough information. Huge mistake to learn from. <br>
<br>
I recently started out somewhere making 1/2 as much money than I was, but I like 
it. Pretty soon, I'll be making more money then I EVER would have at the last 
place.I work with truly good people and I have an awesome manager who 
appreciates and respects me. I have time to eat, sleep and exercise, not worry 
about work when I'm trying to sleep...I just can't tell you how glad I am to be 
away from that guy. I wanted to confront him, but I've decided to pray for him 
and his family instead, because they really need it.<br>
<br>
Pardon my rant, but I hope this advice helps people avoid the pitfall I fell 
into. I'm still recovering from the stress, worry, exhaustion, etc. that my last 
manager put on me to make him feel important. <br>
<br>
Nobody deserves that kind of torture. Quit, find a better job, and watch as that 
guy's position -- or the company -- crumbles to the ground. Do it on the best of 
terms you can so nothing's suspicious when you apply elsewhere. <br>
<br>
LIFE IS TO SHORT to bust your butt over a prick when you could do it somewhere 
wayyyy better. :)<br>

<i><b>Dave replies:</b><br>
The main reason people quit jobs, other than career progression, is because of 
bad management. And indeed it's often the easiest option, especially when the 
manager in question seems unable to listen or accept any criticism and when 
there's no way around them. </i></p>
<p><i>My wife, a teacher, recently had a tricky case of an inexperienced head of 
department who broke many of the rules of good management (and a few 
employment-law ones too). She also was beginning to doubt her ability, but 
fortunately, she had support, went to the head teacher and things are looking 
better now (fingers crossed). One of the things that helped her case is that she 
kept a log of all that was said and done, and took legal advice. It also helped 
that she was financially able to leave, making this a real option and giving her 
greater power. I've also seen another person in different organisation quit and 
send a highly damning email to everyone on the way out (not always a good idea, 
but it pretty much sunk the manager in question, who left soon after).</i></p>
<hr>
<p>Considering what Dave said. Do x,y or z strategies seems like a great 
compliment to what Waynegro described. Think of it, first you get rid of the 
heat/attention from appearing complement/conformative. Then maybe even 
influencing them to be not near you via rapport. </p>
<p>Next comes f'd up status crushing/taking which if done right would make you 
logically an asset who is trained, a friend so you get the benefit of the doubt 
and a martyr as a contingency. </p>
<p>The trick to handling the stress is a commitment to getting attention away 
from you, like driving slower then most appears safer... Coming from someone who 
can not switch jobs. </p>
<p>I'm no better then most, that strategy works on bully's though, even though 
in contrast I'm a $800.00 a month earner . </p>
<p>My situation is, I have a mom and uncle who have this need to control others. 
And he is a doctor my mom retired government and businessowner. I didn't see the 
co-dependency in their intentions early enough. They basically had me in a giant 
game of here's a great opportunity. But even though you're maxed out with 4 jobs 
and full time community college we were kidding about supporting you with 
transportation. The only catch is if you save they account for that and create 
bills that you pay from creative shakedowns. </p>
<p>At 27 I dropped everything because I was too confused in every area to let 
that go on. </p>
<p>Now I work at $8.00 per hour and get 64 hours a check no matter what. Then 
last week we had a major blackout in southern California and they asked a few 
guys to stay late. I did, why not right? 3 days later I got written up for not 
clocking out that night. </p>
<p>So in my company, one &quot;coaching&quot; puts you on probation for freedom to change 
positions for 2 years, I just found out yesterday after I got done talking about 
schedule precautions for my....hopefully...one day wife's new PREGNANCY! </p>
<p>My point is prior to this finger being given to me, I went from 10.50 per 
hour. To accepting a lesser wage with a promise of quickly moving from a temp 
position to staff. BUT it's all that's open. Or no job because were done with 
the remodel. </p>
<p>First they promoted a guy I trained. BECAUSE he bullied me. We push carts and 
he continuously got in my face and continuously aggressively directed me. I uhhh...retorted...and 
he used me to raise his status. </p>
<p>Next they promoted the next new trainee guy in a week, everyone telling me 
hard work would equal promotion. Turned out was a group effort to intentionally 
keep him inside while I did all the work. </p>
<p>Then 2 months go by and first guy starts trouble with me BECAUSE he knew the 
night manager was evaluating us, he tried a few off camera assaults but he's 
really clumsy. So that's when and how I came up with an actual strategy. </p>
<p>I set up a mediated time off a feigned similar fear based complaint I'd 
issued in the past. Then said stuff like how he's valuable and hard working. 
That I didn't know of any complaints. But felt like it was urgent to solve any 
misunderstandings because of our past. </p>
<p>We ended up hugging! LOL And now his identity is solidly forged into 
backbreaking labor at weird hours muahahaha. And never going to be a problem for 
a higher wage setting. Because I'm sure he'd try something serious if it REALLY 
paid.<br>
</p>
<p>Okay, the punch line is I train, study, work, read, submerge my self in 
everything BUT college, because I still need to wait from some sort of probation 
period for not finishing the final in enough classes. And I have been looking 
for AND actively applying for any non-food related job (13 years of that 
already). And everyone assumes I'm lying because I should have graduated 
or....there has to be a reason I earn poverty level income and have so few 
opportunities at 28. </p>
<p>I actually fall in this 1.4% of people who can't succeed because they are 
currently emigrating. </p>
<p>But this is what success looks like....at the beginning. When I'm done I'll 
have to have mastered more then most cause the odds are legendarily more then 
most against me. <br>
