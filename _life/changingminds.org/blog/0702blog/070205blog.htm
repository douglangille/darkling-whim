<p><i>Monday 05-February-07</i><h2>Teenage trouble&nbsp;</h2>
<p style="text-autospace: none">I've written about my daughter's success more 
than once in recent times but have been sadly silent about my son, who will be 
18 on Thursday. This is odd, as he has been on my mind a great deal.&nbsp; Perhaps 
the reason I have not blogged on it is that there is little to boast about and 
things have been said and done that are deeply saddening.</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none">He spent the last school year, pretending to 
work and spending god knows how many hours on the internet. His reward was a 
month-long holiday trekking in Africa. He was supposed to get a job and pay for 
half, but didn't (many excuses).</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none">We hoped that seeing the world and then the 
shock of terrible exam results would help him grow up, and we persuaded the 
school to let him re-take the year. Yet whilst there has been some improvement 
in work, it may not be enough and the deception has continued such that we 
cannot really tell whether anything he says is true or not. </p>
<p style="text-autospace: none">The computer and the internet still seem to be 
at the core of things and we have steadily clamped down on it. Problems have 
continued in one form or another, including things too difficult to mention. 
Most recently, he went through his sister's things when she was away, taking 
what he wanted, then saying he had been given them. When she discovered this she 
felt abused and defiled and unsurprisingly went incandescent and then very, very 
cold. He realized he had crossed a line and apologized abjectly, but after years 
of hurt, it was no longer enough and their relationship may be irreparably 
harmed.</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none">After much thought we have decided to now cut 
off the internet altogether. He will object, no doubt, and maybe seek revenge. 
Yet he has already hurt this family so much already, blaming us for many of his 
ills and bringing shame through his actions.</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none">If he wants to restore something of his sister's 
respect, the best thing he can do is knuckle down hard, really hard, and get 
excellent exam results, but I just don't know if he will do this.</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none">One of the most frustrating things for me is 
that, whilst I have significant understanding of changing minds, my own son is 
so difficult. There is perhaps cold comfort in the fact that my wife, who is a 
teacher with a specialism in troubled teenage boys, has the same problem. Like 
many parents, we don't know what the right thing to do is, and so do what we can 
and hope for the best. </p>
<p style="text-autospace: none">And yet there is hope. Now and again we see the 
kind, thoughtful and funny person inside. Will that true person emerge, or will 
the dark side persist? Only time will tell. </p>
<p style="text-autospace: none" align="center">-- o --</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none"><u>Coda</u>: We planned to have a family 
conference to discuss events and get things out in a safe environment. He 
pre-empted this by declaring he was leaving home, with nowhere to go. This would 
be the end of his formal education and the start of another education so harsh 
it would probably break him. We talked him down in a painful conversation where 
he, as usual, was the centre of attention but contributed little. There was talk 
of him rebuilding respect by working more, yet he subsequently went out and 
spent the evening playing video games. When I tried to talk with him he was back 
in the arrogant, sullen persona that is his suit of armour.</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none">I am left feeling more desperate than ever, as 
is his mother. Que sera, but I fear it will not be good.</p>

<h2 style="text-autospace: none" align="center">Your comments</h2>

<p style="text-autospace: none">Well, that seems to be the real learning 
process. One have to experience everything oneself. You can talk and persuade 
but its just temporary effect ... ? <br>
<br>
-- Ales<br>
<br>
<i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>I hope that some things will sink in eventually. I do think he'll turn out 
ok eventually, but I fear he'll blow his education in the learning process.</i></p>

<hr>

<p style="text-autospace: none">I was given the link to your excellent Syque 
site by a friend recently. Well, from there, I stumbled my way up to your blog, 
and discovered this story. <br>
<br>
First of all, I'm sorry for your troubles.<br>
I can imagine how distressing it must be for you, as a parent, to see your child 
make the wrong choices. <br>
<br>
I wish I had an excellent course of action for you, guaranteed to cure what is 
wrong. But all I can offer is gratuitous advice. I'm no psychologist, but I can 
try to give you my take on this, from my limited experience of life. I'm sure 
its all stuff you already know, but if it even helps a little, Ill consider it 
to have been worthwhile. <br>
<br>
When one is doing well, success builds upon success. But when one is in a rut of 
failure, it tends to spiral and also build upon itself. The worst part of all 
this, is damage to self esteem. I've seen absolutely brilliant people fail in 
life, because they couldn't for the life of themselves, recognise that they were 
gods among men, in terms of raw capability. <br>
<br>
Lack respect for yourself, fuels self destructive activity. Be it relatively 
benign activity, such as spending your time on video games instead of more 
productive pursuits (and this is mostly because these more worthwhile 
activities, such as studying, seem to aspire to a success which is unattainable 
by one), or be it drugs (which hopefully your son has not exposed himself to), 
or alcohol, or any number of other things. Depression follows with almost 
assured certainty. <br>
<br>
I would hazard a guess that failing in exams, and far more importantly, failing 
in your eyes has taken its toll on your son's self esteem. <br>
<br>
The only answer is for him to find a way OUT of the rut of failure. Even ONE 
success can reawaken the realization that he is a bright, intelligent, competent 
and good person, worthy of all the best things in life. And that the world is 
full of excellent opportunities, far more worthwhile than some stupid game 
that'll be out of date in a month or two. <br>
<br>
As a parent, its hard to let go. But there is truth in the old maxim, &quot;you can 
take a horse to the water, but you can't make him drink&quot;. I say, DON?T indulge 
the child who wants to be told what to do, so he can blame his misfortunes on 
others. My dad always made it clear to me, that he loved me, no matter who I 
was- a success, or a screw-up--and that it was up to me what I would be! It was 
a blow. <br>
I was robbed of all the luxury of wondering what I wanted, and being angsty. My 
life was in my own hands. An enormous responsibility. <br>
<br>
I'm sure that an experienced professional such as yourself will be able to 
encourage the responsible young adult who knows what's best for himself (though 
of course, its so easy to seem patronising in the eyes of an unhappy teenager).
<br>
<br>
When we realize that our future is in our own hands, that we are not sheltered, 
that our destiny is of our own creation- we generally make the right decision.
<br>
<br>
The future sometimes looks bleak when we don?t see all the good that it holds.
<br>
<br>
I'm sorry this message is somewhat disjointed, it was written on the fly. <br>
<br>
I do hope that every thing works our for you, and your family, and that your son 
realises that these are some of the best years of his life, and that he should 
get off his rear, and go out and meet them with a cheery disposition. Life is 
too short to waste it being unhappy. <br>
<br>
Warm Regards <br>
<br>
-- AS<br>
<br>
<i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>It's a wise reply and thank you very much. I do try to give him 
opportunities for success but believe that, for esteem, he must pick up the 
baton himself.&nbsp; I also do look for things to praise him for, but there are 
also relatively few things here. He knows we love him. He also knows that 
laziness is not an acceptable place in this house. </i></p>
<p style="text-autospace: none"><i>Over the past few days, since the internet 
has been off, he has been much nicer and worked harder. I suspect there's an 
addiction pattern at play here.</i></p>
<p style="text-autospace: none"><i>I think he'll turn out ok. His sister at his 
age was a terror, but now is a well-qualified and successful businesswoman. I 
know that's no guarantee, but it does give us hope.</i></p>
<hr>

<p style="text-autospace: none">An interesting and sad story. Your situation is 
one that repeats itself everywhere - no matter what theories there are humans 
are so complex and have motivations that are often not apparent to ourselves 
even.<br>
<br>
Just some initial ponderings:<br>
It would be very hard living up to a family of achievers - your son, may just be 
having some time out from your stress on results and not being &quot;lazy&quot; as you put 
it. Perhaps you may all benefit from some meditation or yoga etc to ponder on 
how people are different and that what your goals may not be right for your son 
- at this time.<br>
<br>
Your definition of success may be narrow as well - you mention that your 
daughter is a successful business woman so she has turned out okay - but is she 
really happy? Is she contributing to the world in a way that truly satisfies? 
Perhaps she is and that would be fantastic to combine success in both personal 
and 'professional'/occupational life.<br>
<br>
You mention that you have not mentioned your son much in the past but have 
lauded your daughter - doesn't that show such disrespect of your son as an 
individual - there must be something you can find to be proud of - that he is 
great on some internet games for instance - this is a skill too. what about 
other interests that he has or had had when a little boy - nature? movies? the 
environment? ...<br>
<br>
It seems sad that in such a competitive environment, for one to be successful 
others have to fail - for one to do well in exams, others have to do 
poorly...obviously someone's son or daughter will be the ones who do 
poorly...perhaps it is the competitive system that is at fault rather than the 
individuals who choose not to partake in such &quot;sorting&quot; activities. <br>
<br>
Your language is too deterministic - such as your sons and his sisters 
relationship may be lost forever - that is a long time, and your son isn't even 
an adult yet. From your language it seems that they have not got on for some 
time - perhaps it is time for some psychological counselling to help the family 
towards some respect for each other as individuals with their own path to 
fulfilment?<br>
<br>
Personally I like family systems therapists, but there are many different 
theories and types, and sometimes you just have to search around to get the one 
that suits all.<br>
<br>
All the best, hope these ramblings have been useful, H.M<br>
<br>
-- Heather<br>
<br>
<i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Thanks, Heather, for your thoughtful comments. My ranting here does not 
reflect my language with my son. I do look for ways to praise 
him every day. I try hard not to be a pushy parent (and sometimes wonder if I 
have not pushed enough). I believe in offering opportunities but not 
force-feeding. My daughter is happy enough -- as all early jobs, it's up and 
down. All I want for my children is that they are independent and happy. My wife 
and I practiced Tai Chi for many years and now incorporate principles in living. 
I've also been trained in counselling. Is the family responsible in some ways? 
Yes. Am I? Yes. Do we work on it? Yes. We use blameless in-family talking 
sessions to air issues rather than repress. And it's still hard. </i></p>
<hr>

<p style="text-autospace: none">&nbsp;Like other folks, my heart goes out to you 
and your wife. Having suffered and survived the teenage heebie jeebies with a 
daughter, I wish I could offer the answers. Recently found a wonderful book of 
parenting called &quot;Parenting with Love and Logic&quot;. Has one specially for the 
teenage variety of kids. Anyway, what is so powerful and helpful, is that it 
foils the &quot;blame it on someone else&quot; syndrome and it eliminates the anger thing 
on the part of parents. Give it a read and it will click or not.<br>
PS: I am on this blog because I am checking a reference that a student provided 
in a paper :) <br>
<br>
-- Janet<br>
<br>
<i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Thanks, Janet. I'll look out for it. At the moment everything is ok. He's 
just turned 18 and we've given him 'adult responsibility' for revising for his 
exams, which means we will support him but will make no suggestions that could 
be interpreted as parental pressure. I hope he'll get there. In the end it's his 
life and he must learn the law of responsibility and consequence.</i></p>
<hr>
<p style="text-autospace: none">&nbsp;Dear Dave:</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none">Just arrived at your blog. There can be a 
beginning, a middle, a near-the-end and an end of a project, job, state of 
understanding, or whatever. What if you, your wife and daughter are in the 
middle, but your son is at the end? Your son may be in a state of transition, 
while the rest of you are not. </p>
<p style="text-autospace: none">Perhaps you are at different points, so you have 
different understanding or understandings. You are an engineer, your wife is a 
teacher, your daughter is in business. What if your son is an artist, and only 
senses at this point a creative urge, but does not yet know what or where it is 
or how to express it. He may need to sink within himself in order to change his 
perspective or point of view, and that will refresh him. Is he musical? Does he 
write? Buy him an instrument and a nice journal and fountain pen. Maybe he can 
appreciate the abstract, while his family members appreciate something else. <br>
<br>
-- John Williamson<br>
<br>
<i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Thanks, John. He is certainly trying to figure himself out in some ways. He 
would like to be an artist and draws a lot. We encourage him to express himself 
but he is not a good artist. He could be musical. We bought him a guitar at 
Christmas but it got played little. I think he'd like to be able to play but 
lacks the motivation to learn. He has a good pen and can write very well when he 
chooses, but this is infrequent.</i></p>
<p style="text-autospace: none"><i>Update: we have removed the computer from his 
life and his behaviour has significantly improved. The vitriol has largely gone. 
He has also turned 18 and some more of the responsibilities of adulthood has 
sunk in, I think.</i></p>
<hr>
<p style="text-autospace: none">&nbsp;Applying logic to teenagers can sometimes 
be...well illogical. However, just because someone has illogical behaviour 
doesn't mean that he is excused from accountability. I've always been a huge 
advocate of wayward teens getting a job. Your family will forgive many 
transgressions that an employer will not. I never liked being dependent on my 
parents, so I started 2 successful businesses even before I got a job mowing 
lawns, landscaping, and the like. I rarely met any of my family's unrealistic 
expectations, but now enjoy a much better life for myself having worked as an 
engineer for the past 10 years. Sometimes, it's best just to set boundaries and 
stick to them. Keeping the plug pulled on the computer is a very good start. 
Just as few neighbourhood football players are good enough for the World Cup, 
few gamers are good enough to compete or program new games. <br>
<br>
-- Martin<br>
<br>
<i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Martin: do you want a job - as a son? I have tried getting my son to find 
work, from washing cars to working in a games shop. But all I get are excuses 
and I know enough not to push. I've also shown him the rudiments of programming 
in the hope that he's find interest there, but no. </i></p>
<p style="text-autospace: none"><i>I'm now pretty bereft of ideas. He just rolls 
downhill. Without computer games he watches TV, and without that he just sits 
there. He's had medical attention and is not depressed. And any attempt to talk 
with him is met with appalling unpleasantness. It just seems like an extended 
period of the Teenage Troubles. Sorry to go on about it, but that's partly what 
a blog is for and expressing my feelings helps, as does the kind thoughts from 
people around the world like you.</i></p>
<p style="text-autospace: none"><i>I don't think he is bad and still have hope 
that he will wake up one day, but I cannot see it before the horizon. I fear he 
will fall further before he turns the corner. See more recent notes at 
<a href="../0703blog/070305blog.htm">Reality blindness</a></i>.</p><hr>

<p style="text-autospace: none">&nbsp;I feel your pain - literally. I have a son 
who will be 18 in a couple of months and he has shown a lot of the same apparent 
lack of motivation/passion for life as your son. A bright and capable guy, my 
boy seems to have squandered too much of his youth on a similar style of 
laziness. Added to this sad scenario, he has now discovered the opposite sex in 
a rather unwholesome way, which he is unable to or uninterested in controlling. 
This is now leading him further away from school work, a normal family life, or 
anything resembling a bright future. The most passionate thing going for him now 
is his desire to rebel against mom and dad. He has &quot;run away&quot; a few times now 
only to return in progressively declining condition. Sex, drugs, late night 
hours, unsavory associates, disrespect and just plain ignorance are what seem to 
rule his existence now. Plenty of people will say that this is just a phase lots 
of kids go through. Part of me believes this too as I have an unexplainable 
faith that he will turn out OK -eventually. I guess this is part of what Jung 
calls the individuation process. <br>
In the meantime, I just want him to survive long enough to discover what his 
life could really be about.<br>
As I see that your original post is well over a year old now, please tell me 
there is a light at the end of the tunnel. <br>

<i><b>Dave replies </b>(May-08)<b>:<br>
</b></i><i>It's almost like a disease, isn't it, Manuel? And the 'will he 
survive' question has been in my mind more than once. Thankfully, my son does 
not seem to have got into drugs. I wrote a <a href="../0804blog/080411blog.htm">
more recent blog</a> on 'the story so far', though since then he has improved a 
lot -- the real difference was when he got a job. We had a 'no internet until 
you've held down a job for a month' rule, which seems to have helped a lot. He 
has lapses but is much more civil now. I think it's partly to do with 
self-respect and partly to do with having to be pleasant to people all day has 
led him to appreciate others more.</i></p>
<p style="text-autospace: none"><i>We've had a philosophy of keeping the 
communications channel open and, whilst not accepting bad behaviour, we have 
(mostly) not responded to anger with anger. His older sister, who he respects, 
has helped too. She can be more direct with him and he has listened more to her. 
In any case, we have our fingers crossed for him.</i></p>
<hr>

<p style="text-autospace: none">i don't offer my opinion but rather, an 
acknowledgement of the situation. I am 15, and in my household.. i see the same, 
accept my older brother is having problems.. and i am doing well. But i have 
something that i dont show. This is that.. i sometimes feel sick from worrying 
about him, and i feel so sad for him and living up to the goal my mum has set 
isn't easy, it feels like the only thing that matters to her is that i am 
successful from other peoples eyes, and not happy in myself which seems to me, 
to be more important. <br>
My brother hasn't got a job. He has alcohol problems and so much more. It is 
hard for my parents i know, because there is a language barrier between them and 
their children. this makes it hard for any one of us to come to them with our 
problems. <br>
Also being the youngest makes me the last one out of home, the last child. I 
think my parents, especially mum is having trouble dealing with this. She is 
going through a crisis of her own i suspect. Even though i want to help her. My 
relationship with her isn't that strong and sometimes i find it easier to cut 
her out of my life for a day or two, just so i can get away from all the stress. 
Its hard both ways.<br>
Not to mention the school environment stress.<br>
Its not easy. <br>

</b>Hi Ania. Many sympathies. I wasn't too rebellious as a child myself but 
remember well the problems my parents had with my sisters. They turned out ok, 
though at the time I wondered what I should do. In a more
<a href="../0805blog/080521blog.htm">recent blog</a></i> <i>I noted that my son 
has improve hugely after getting a job. He's not perfect but I think the job has 
done a lot for his self-respect -- and that's a key part of it all. When

what's going on in their heads.</i></p>

<p>Hi I'm Tina and I have two sons one will be 13 in April the other is turning 
15 in 2 weeks, the younger is a kind gentle child still while his brother and I 
have butted heads for a year solid. His dad who is not in the home decided to 
let him live with him to see if that helps, he doesn't act this way around him. 
So I allowed this move. His dad and I split up 2 days before his birth. So I 
thought that he really seeked knowing how it is to live with him. It's been 6 
months and his dad has allowed him to miss school &quot;sick&quot; at least twice a month 
so now he's in trouble with truancy or whatever and telling me handle it all. 
Well I just want my son home, but now he's enjoyed the easy life of laying 
around the time no chores nothing. I truly think he agreed to this so he'd get 
out of child support, he was behind and now it's caught up and I will owe him 75 
bucks next month. I don't know what to do, he doesn't think he should do 
anything but eat sleep and shit and i hate seeing lazy people anyone, especially 
my own kid just lazying through life. Thanks for any advise.</p>

<p><i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Hi Tina. Tricky situation you have there. Now that your son is with his 
father, it doesn't seem like you can do much about it. One of the most difficult 
things for a parent is to let go of their children, letting them live the lives 
they will live, especially when you know it's not so good. Your son's making 
choices, just as mine made, that he will regret later. If he matures and you let 
him, he'll feel able to admit it. It's difficult to tell how things will turn 
out and it looks like you must, for now, just let things go as they will. So 
don't worry too much for now. One day your son will have to grow up.</i></p>
<p><i>One thing you can do is not to give him anything to push against when you 
see him. If he's being lazy, say nothing. Ask what he's been doing, and when he 
says 'nothing', just say 'ok'. Beware of becoming a soft touch. If he comes back 
to live with you at some time (maybe when maybe his father gets fed up with 
him), impose conditions and be straight. Tough love and all that.</i></p>
<p><i>My son is now 20, living at home and slowly becoming more civil. He's got 
a job at the local supermarket and beginning to notice that he's somewhat 
smarter than the others there. It's his life, though, and he must live it 
himself. Regret is tough, and he's not admitted any yet. He doesn't save 
anything, but we force it by charging him rent, but are putting it by for when 
he leaves.</i></p>
<hr>

<p>&nbsp;Oh my can I feel your pain. My son is 17 and has been in and out of 
school because of behavior problems his whole life. I am so over this...he is 
doing online high school and is almost finished. Has 3 classes and chooses to be 
on the internet - I can't take away the internet b/c that's where his school is. 
He is mouthy and disrespectful to his father and I. My husband is in the 
military overseas and so we have to tread a very fine line b/c the military will 
come after my husband if we choose to really discipline. My son has been the 
cause of my depression throughout the years - I have broken my back trying to 
ensure he is not labeled in life. He is very smart, plays football and 
basketball for the high school (they let him play as a homeschooler) and does 
not drink or do drugs, but the laziness and disrespect is too much. I am so 
ready for him to move out...I now resent him and know that I don't want to live 
with him so I am counting down the days. <br>

My son has now moved away to stay with friends. No job, but there you go. He's got to live his own 
life and I believe he's trying, in his own way. He's still making a meal of 
'growing up' and is not ready to talk about a range of subjects, but I know he'll get there one day. Till then I'm getting on with 
my life too.</i></p>
<hr noshade>

<p>Dave my heart is with you. As a parent, I believe that we want our children 
to grow into responsible reliable trustworthy people. My 15 year old daughter is 
struggling as well, refuses to attend school (bullying that is not dealt with by 
teachers, etc), sick of going to counsellors (because of reactions to bullying - 
she has an 'attitude') but now she really has an attitude and has become what 
she detested - a bully (especially towards me). All she desires is to spend 
every day wandering around with her friends at the local shopping mall and 
swimming in the creek. &quot;I am happy there&quot;. Has horses that are not cared for by 
her, is musically talented - &quot;you say I am musical because you are a parent but 
I am not!&quot; She plays piano, drums, guitar, clarinet, several types of recorder 
(mainly self taught) and reads music easily. She was an A student until 2 years 
ago and now is failing at school, &quot;doesn't care&quot;, and &quot;it's my life&quot; while 
holding her hand out for money to buy junk food. Tough, I am now refusing the 
money because we have food at home - get a job. The school has said she doesn't 
need to be there but hopefully we have convinced her to attend next year and 
maybe get a traineeship. Her hair is black, with black eyes and wears skinnies 
with singlets and death jackets she gets from her friends. The abuse and foul 
language she throws at me is quite frankly scary and her home habits are filthy 
and totally disrespectful. Occasionally, I am able to get her to do the dishes 
but her room is trashed, literally. Her father knows little because she insists 
that he not be told anything and when she is with him on weekends, she is not 
with him because she is everywhere else. How to motivate and encourage our kids 
- no matter what I say, positive or negative, it is returned with a mouth of 
foul language so I stay silent which gets me a dose as well because I am 
ignoring her. I am tired and want it to stop. I love her but don't like her. 
Will she turn her life around? Will her failings now destroy her future 
opportunities? <br>

<i><b>Dave replies (Nov09):</b><br>
Hi Heather. My very deepest sympathies for your plight. It's so frustrating 
seeing talent going to waste. You're doing the right thing in not giving her 
money for junk food. Tough love is the right word. She needs to know that you 
love her but also deep inside needs you to provide stability and control whilst 
she also feels in control of her life. It's a lot about control and it's a very 
tricky path to navigate -- too much by you and she'll pull away too much. It's a 
bit like fishing -- you have to give them space to grow up but at the same time 
quietly reel them back to sanity and adulthood.<br>
<br>
Regarding my son, the last 'friend' he stayed with bled him dry of funds then 
kicked him out. He's back home and in college now. We've our fingers cross and 
he says he's doing well but doesn't seem to be doing any work at home. I can 
only believe the actual results I see, which will be next Summer.</i></p><hr>
<p>My name is Jeannie. The letter that follows here, are things a 33 year old 
gentlemen (and full time college student) said he wished he would have said to 
his father before he died. Unfortunately, he had not matured until long after 
his father had died and he had become a father himself.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dear Dad,<br>
<br>
So many times when I failed at a task, your encouragement helped me succeed. <br>
<br>
I learned that every accomplishment is it's own reward, but nothing compared to 
your pride in me.<br>
<br>
When high school began something had changed; I never felt less assured.<br>
<br>
It seemed anything I'd say or do was always subject to the values, views and 
expectations that came from your life, whereas before this time, your life had 
been mine too.<br>
<br>
I didn't understand why I was feeling so separate from you. <br>
<br>
I kept trying, and no matter what, I could never hit the hit the mark.<br>
<br>
Dad, I know you were disappointed when I didn't finish college. I have been 
trying to get my degree again, but it has been so hard since the kids came 
along. You'd said I'd be sorry, because it only gets harder.<br>
<br>
But what I am sorry for, was that I did not grow up fast enough to gain this 
perspective as well as the words to finally tell you...<br>
<br>
You were right about many things. You were not right about everything. <br>
<br>
I started to realize how much I loved you, by how much I missed you. But this 
was before I became a parent myself.<br>
<br>
Now, being as concerned for my children as I know you were for me, overwhelms me 
with sorrow to have not understood your love for me while you were still here 
for me to thank.<br>
<br>

<b>Dave replies (Nov-10):<br>
</b>Lovely letter, Jeannie. Thanks. My son continues to wake up, though in fits 
and starts and slides and leaps. He got mixed results in his AS exams last 
Summer. Could have been worse, could have been better. He admitted he could have 
worked harder and resolved (again) to pull his finger out. Will he do enough to 
get to University? Perhaps. I'll believe what I see, though I'm more hopeful 
than I was. He's plenty bright enough and he's gradually getting a better grip 
on reality. He's also getting much more civil and is now more often polite than 
rude. I have always believed in his potential. Fingers crossed (but not as 
tightly as before).</i></p>
<hr>
<p>Iam 18 &amp; have a brother who's 15. Us being teenagers puts a lot of pressure 
on our parents. I've successfully gained a medical college and my brother is in 
10th std. When i was 15 or 16 i used to be very rude to my parents, lazy, 
disobedient and everything. The last thing my mom told me was &quot;u'll know when 
u'll be a mother&quot; which of course didn't make any sense. My parents never forced 
me for studies but they were damn strict 'bout certain things. Now i understand 
a lot 'bout their pain &amp; life. <br>

<p>An eye opener for me. I have two kids son is 18 years old. He has not been a 
problematic kid, except in few situations. My daughter is 15years old. I am much 
worried of her, as she lacks interest in anything and is not serious about her 
studies. Her lack of concentration and daydreaming are her major drawbacks. I 
wish I could help her get through this phase. </p>

<p><i><b>Dave replies (Sep 11):<br>
</b>It's always a worry and can get problematic. My son is now 22 and is just 
off to university. He has improved over the past years but has not yet fully 
woken up. We have our fingers crossed, as always. I read some research recently 
that the best thing you can do as parents is to keep loving them and let them 
know this, even if you have to take stronger control sometimes. Love,&nbsp; 
patience and doing the best you can. It seems to be the right way.</i></p>

<p>My boy is only 14 doing drugs with my ex the father of my younger two, we 
dont have any thing to do with him since i found he was giving.it to my boy, now 
my boy takes off a lot there we. We moving states in five months my boy says he 
not coming he say he take off what can i do :( <br>

<i><b>Dave replies (Aug 12):<br>
</b>Goodness, Melissa, you've got serious problems there. If this is illegal 
where you are, then maybe get the law involved? Moving state is probably a good 
move. If you are still his legal guardian then he won't have an option but to go 
with you. I'd also look around for local social help.</i></p>
<p><i>An update about my son: he survived his first year in university and came 
back more sociable than when he went, but still can't face home truths. He is 
still deceptive, but not as much as he has been. He's off for his second year 
next week. Fingers crossed he'll wake up a bit more in the coming year.</i></p>
