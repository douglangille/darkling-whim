<p><i>Monday 09-July-07</i><h2>Farewell, Joe</h2>
<p>Joe Podolsky, an old and dear friend, died at the weekend. I met him only a few times but 
we conversed over many years. He 
was someone I loved and admired and who had a significant influence on my life.</p>
<p>We met when we both worked in Hewlett Packard were a part of a vibrant 
community of people there who thought that improving the business was both 
critical and very interesting. We went to world-wide conferences, exchanged 
ideas and spread new thinking as far as we could. Changing minds was the order 
of the day and few did it better than Joe.</p>
<p>Back in the early 1990s the 
internet was in its infancy but Joe was in there, thinking and sharing in the 
generous way he lived. <a href="../0511blog/051123blog.htm">Joe's Jottings</a> 
became a company symbol for sharing. Here's the very first one. As ever, it 
challenged conventional thinking and contained perhaps uncomfortable truths.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<div align="center">
  <table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="90%" cellpadding="7" id="table1">
    <tr>
      <td>
      <p>
      Date: 29 November 1994<p>As you all know, I read a lot of stuff. I was 
      telling someone about one of the articles I had seen, and he very kindly 
      suggested that others also might be interested. So, I'll occasionally 
      share with you a short note about something I think is unusual or 
      important. I'll also tell you where I saw the article, so you can dig into 
      it more if you want.</p>
      <p>Please let me know if you want me to continue this. Feel free to share 
      this with anyone you want.</p>
      <p>Here's the abstract of the article that got this started:</p>
      <p>Three professors collected data from 176 MIS projects at 60 different 
      organizations (No, I don't know if HP is represented). They looked at the 
      size, risk, and organizational commitment for the projects based on how 
      they were selected. Here's what they found:</p>
      <p>Projects selected by top management do NOT tend to be more strategic, 
      profitable, resource consuming, larger risk, or related to organizational 
      well-being than other project selection groups. These projects, however, 
      did tend to experience the longest start delay and elapsed development 
      time.</p>
      <p>Projects selected by steering committees tended to be larger and 
      riskier, and require more organizational change. Formal cost-benefit 
      analysis is more predominant, but surprisingly, projects selected are NOT 
      more cross-functional in scope.</p>
      <p>User department-selected projects, comparatively, are smaller, more 
      quickly developed, and involve the fewest users, layers of management, and 
      business functions.</p>
      <p>MIS-selected projects have more of an integration focus and follow more 
      logical sequences of development. Their projects experience fewer delays 
      in deliberation and duration, and less concern is given to cost benefit 
      analysis.</p>
      <p>from McKeen, Guimaraes, and Wetherbe, &quot;A Comparative Analysis of MIS 
      Selection Mechanisms,&quot; ACM DATA BASE, August 1994, pp19 - 39.</p>
      <p>Regards, Joe </td>

<p><br>
This idea of just openly sharing reading and thinking was typical of the HP Way, 
which Joe embodied so well. He set an example that I have tried to emulate ever 
since and this website is a direct result.</p>
<p>When I think of Joe now I feel warm and happy. He had a good life and made a 
difference, which is perhaps the best you can say of anyone.</p>
<p>Farewell, Joe.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><br>
&nbsp;I will remember Joe as an agile-minded and generous man. As Chaucer 
wrote when he described the Clerk on the pilgrimage to Canterbury: &quot;Gladly wolde 
he lerne and gladly teche.&quot; <br>
<br>
-- Bruce Karney (HP 1981-2005)<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p><br>
I will always remember Joe with fondness. He was one of the people who 
interviewed me when I applied to join HP's Corporate Quality group in Palo Alto. 
After I got the job in Corporate Quality in early 1988, Joe provided me needed 
orientation, valuable advice, human warmth, and intelligent humor. As did many 
others, I enjoyed reading &quot;Joe's Jottings&quot; and occasionally participated in his 
book discussion group. My sincerest condolences go to his wife Hudi, their 
daughters, and the extended family. <br>

  <p class="MsoPlainText">I just got back from a lovely ceremony at Beth Am in 
  Palo Alto, a beautiful synagogue on about 10 acres of land in the Los Altos 
  foothills.&nbsp; Probably 800 to 1000 people there.&nbsp; Learned lots more about Joe, a 
  very loved man.</div>

<p>&nbsp;Hi, just dropped by to<br>
<br>
1. say thanks for your site. I really adore it, I rarely learned so much in so 
little time in such interesting topics.<br>
<br>
2. Rant about HP. A friend of mine literally adores HP, not the brand of course, 
but the entire engineering mentality. He'd like to live in HP &quot;golden era&quot;. Not 
surprisingly he is an excellent electronic engineer, just 35 years old, but 
nonetheless among the few ones who still has that special quid about knowledge, 
understanding, an approach that is fascinatingly happy yet still rational to 
reality ..that makes him a special person to me, notwithstanding his serious 
social personal shortcomings.<br>
<br>
I am saddened by your loss and even more saddened to see that we are still ruled 
by a status-quo that prefers stagnation to rapid development, ruling by 
deceptive confusion, just because they are NOT able to keep the pace and 
therefore are afraid to lose control. It appears to me that Joe, by sharing that 
insight, wanted to point out such shortcoming.<br>
<br>
Which is a behavior absolutely not appreciated by many.<br>
<br>
In your site I see the same desire to share, to learn, to communicate with 
likely minded people. It mainly shames, while at the same time inspiring me, 
that I have not been able, so far, to achieve such sharing results. I hope I'll 
will be able in the future.<br>
<br>
Signed and sincerely,<br>
<br>
Mario, just a guy from Italy.<br>
<br>
<i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Thanks, Mario. Joe was an inspiration to many. He in turn was inspired by 
Bill and Dave (Hewlett and Packard) and probably others. You don't have to be an 
engineer to look past the money. The greatest legacy is the number of people you 
inspire. I've written of other inspirations, such as in '<a href="../0512blog/051202blog.htm">Friends and fathers</a></i>'
<i>and do what I can. I'm still just a guy, too, and struggle each day to get 
things right. </i></p>
<hr>

<p>Hi Everyone. I don't know if you're still tracking this blog thread or if 
you'll get this, but I wanted to thank you. </p>
<p>As some of you know, I'm Joe's youngest daughter, Joni. I was Googling my 
dad's name to see if I could find any of his old jottings. I'm planning to start 
my own blog, Joni's Jottings--a bit of a salute to my dad--and wanted to 
reference his jottings as my first blog entry. </p>
<p>What a lovely surprise to find this blog in his memory, and to find that 
someone compiled all his jottings on a website! </p>
<p>He was so incredibly prolific, and I am not, but it will still be fun for me 
to blog. </p>
<p>I don't know who started this blog, or who took the time to make his jottings 
into a website, but I thank you so much for keeping his spirit alive in this 
way! </p>
<p>All the best, Joni </p>
<hr>

<p>Joe's Jottings is an inspiration to me, and Joe and I had several lively, 
enjoyable email discussions. </p>
<p>Joe continues to make a difference. </p>
<p>Best regards, Gary Tracy</p>
