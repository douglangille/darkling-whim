<p><i>Sunday 14-July-13</i><h2>Why science and religion are the same</h2>
<p>It may sound like hypocrisy, but science and religion are basically the same.
</p>
<p>Full disclosure is probably useful here. I am quite well qualified, with a 
degree in engineering and several postgraduate degrees, including psychology. 
This has two effects. First, it gives me a strong scientific leaning with a 
tendency to analyze everything. Secondly, I am not tied into any single 
discipline and often find it useful to take multiple simultaneous viewpoints.
</p>
<p>When I was young I was a fairly cherubic choirboy, in awe of the godly 
church. In my teens I naively read about spacemen as gods and read ghost stories 
on the edge of my seat. Now I am agnostic, nostalgically envious of true 
believers while cursed with a mind that refuses to believe as I once did. </p>
<p>And yet it is all belief, religion and science. Each has its authorities who 
interpret, preach and administer the canons of knowledge. In my education I read 
and accepted science just as I blindly accepted the Bible as the unchallengeable 
word of God. In both cases, as a curious individual who likes to explore, I 
asked stupid questions like 'Why?' and 'How?' And in both cases I found 
boundaries where, if I crossed, I got slapped down and derided, at best as a 
misguided fool. </p>
<p>And yet both are based in the explanation of human experience. In science, 
you form a hypothesis for an observation and then do experiments to prove it 
true, and so create a proven theory. Similarly, religion is based in 
observation, experience and explanation. The pagans explained the forces of 
nature as the acts of various gods. In modern religions too, natural disasters 
are seen as acts of God. </p>
<p>As science historian Thomas Kuhn explains in 'The Structure of Scientific 
Revolutions', science evolves in fits and starts, mostly with subtle 
adjustments of established theories to fit new observations. Sometimes, 
however, major breakthroughs shake up the old order and cause a serious 
reshaping of what is held to be true. Such change indeed has the shape of a 
bloody revolution, with the old order only dying out with its authoritarian 
elders. </p>
<p>Religion also has had its revolutions and some of the battles are still 
raging. It is no wonder that Jesus was crucified as he challenged the status quo 
with modern thoughts of tolerance and kindness, yet still fundamentalists cling 
to the Old Testament today. There have also been many differences and schisms 
through the ages that have further divided churches and religions. </p>
<p>Despite their differences, religions have much in common, with a general 
theme of social support and intolerance of other views. Monotheism is 
widespread, though the actual desires, actions and shape of God are much 
disputed. Worship is common, though variably practiced. The whole is kept in 
order by a priesthood, though the independence of priests varies greatly between 
religions. </p>
<p>Scientists also have their own social structure, with professorial high 
priests and rebellious researchers. Like religions, they claim to be working for 
the good of mankind. And, like religions, they are intolerant of contradictory 
views, with cruel ways of ostracizing those who stray too far. </p>
<p>While claiming a goal of peace and social support, both religion and science 
are systems of power and have been used for social control and as a means to 
war. Religions can end up seeking to destroy non-believers while science has 
provided the means of mass destruction. </p>
<p>And yet it is all founded in the very human system of belief. We cannot prove 
everything for ourselves, and so must believe others whose belief is also 
founded on those who have gone before. In fact you cannot prove anything. Karl 
Popper shook up 20th century scientific thinking when he noted that you can 
confirm things a thousand times yet this does not prove it will never happen. 
The only real proof is to show that something you say cannot happen, does 
happen, which leads to the inverted experimental method of falsification. 
Basically, if you think something is true then you must devise an experiment 
that shows it is false. If this fails and it cannot be false then, like Sherlock 
Holmes, you have proven it true. </p>
<p>Falsification suits science but is a dilemma for religion. How can you 
disprove the existence of God? This also provides a buffer against scientists 
who, very unscientifically, declare that God does not exist. Atheism is a belief 
system every bit as much as the religions that atheists deny. For science, the 
existence of god (or magic, for that matter) cannot be disproven and is hence 
are of little interest. When things are outside the studiable natural world, 
they are simply described as 'supernatural'. </p>
<p>Within the non-religious world, science and psychology have been uneasy 
bedfellows. Science is based in hard and repeatable measurement. Yet people are 
not entirely predictable, which makes laws about how humans behave difficult to 
pin down. Certainly, we do science-like experiments, but all we can do is report 
on results and suggest probabilities. The holy grail of generalization is much 
harder when it comes to people. If you control for other variables you may get a 
certain predictability in the laboratory, yet in the outer world and in 
different cultures, people can act very differently. </p>
<p>Psychology has even more in common with religion. It is about people. It 
deals in intangibles that defy measurement. Yet it is still a science and 
perhaps offers a bridge between the two as it asks us to consider and accept 
complexities beyond our ken. And, of course, it is our selves, our minds, our 
brains which experience, think and believe. </p>
<p>And what of religious experience, on which religions place such emphasis? To 
the neuroscientist it is simply the activation of a bit of the brain. Yet this 
also explains the whole of our experiences and thoughts. And, reflexively, we 
are using our brains to think about our brains, which poses another conundrum. 
Yet religious experience has converted hardened scientists as it creates 
bottomless feelings of joy and connection. With the mysteries of quantum science 
and things yet to be discovered, we cannot say what connection there is between 
people and beyond, though we surely experience this in our daily interactions.
</p>
<p>And so religion and science are not opposite poles in a black-and-white 
dichotomy. Both seek to explain outer and inner experiences. Each professes to 
serve both individuals and a wider society. Both are based in canons of belief 
which may yet be questioned, though at the challenger's peril. </p>
<p>If you have taken this divided view, then perhaps you might try stepping down 
from your podium and going to meet and explore other places. It may surprise you 
how much you have in common with those who profess alternative beliefs. And 
together you might find a new place between.</p><hr>
<h2 align="center">Your comments</h2>
<hr>
<p>I appreciate this article. I am not a scientist although I do think from time 
to time. I came to the same conclusion that science and belief in God both 
require faith. I came to this by reasoning that due to our nature we always have 
limited knowledge and need to make some kind of assumption as a starting point, 
even to hold temporarily in mind an idea we doubt or disbelieve. For the things 
unknown requires some kind of ability to assume they are so. For example, 
somewhere in the universe, there are monkeys eating ice cream cones surfing on 
ski slopes. Of course I know that sounds absurd yet I am in the universe and the 
image exists in my mind (though you may think my mind has left the world) so at 
least temporarily it is true in the extreme abstract. Yet the preachers describe 
that as the nature of faith. And to close, faith for us must rest on faith and 
not on knowledge. That\'s like psychology as you described it. Scientific 
knowledge as we know it is always subject to experimentation which is a humble 
admission, we don\'t know everything. </p>
<p>-- Tzod E.</p>
<p><i><br>
<b>Dave replies::<br>
</b>You're right, Tzod, in that we have limited knowledge and
<a href="../../explanations/theories/bounded_rationality.htm">bounded 
rationality</a> which limits our ability to reason and forces a need to believe.
</i></p>
<p><i>If you accept the principles that the universe is limited in sized (most 
scientists agree this), and that there are an infinite number of parallel 
universes, then things get interesting. It means there are a huge number of 
universes identical to this one in every detail. And then also many with one 
atom slightly moved. In fact there are many universes with every atom (and 
subatomic particle, and field) in every possible combination. A step on from 
this is to think about time as stepping between stationary universes rather than 
the illusory movement of one universe. This makes time travel, forward and 
backward, quite feasible...</i></p><hr>
<p>Wow! I finally found someone who sees the similarities and accepts both as 
one human experience. Why the division and who's right or wrong. If faith works 
for you, go for it. If science is what puts your mind at peace.... Why not. </p>
<p>As long as we don't spend our energy trying to prove that the other opinion 
or &quot;fact&quot; is wrong.</p>
<p>I am a Christian, a believer. I also read a lot about science ,psychology, 
and human behaviors. I finally after shifting from one to another found the link 
between the two and I see no contradiction, other than what humans are trying to 
create so they can either be elevated to the rank of intellectuals or put down 
as simple and dogmatic. <br>
