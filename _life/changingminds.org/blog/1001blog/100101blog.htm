<p><i>Friday 01-January-10</i><h2>The Mask Theory of Eccentricity</h2>
<p>I've <a href="../0909blog/090904blog.htm">blogged</a> in the past about 
eccentricity, a topic that is of interest to more people perhaps than might 
admit it. In musing about the subject, I've come up with the 'Mask Theory of 
Eccentricity'. I've not done endless research on this, it's just conjecture, 
though I have studied psychology and hope that it makes useful sense.</p>
<p>The metaphor of wearing <a href="../../explanations/identity/masks.htm">masks</a> is not new and we wear them to protect our 
vulnerable inner
<a href="../../disciplines/psychoanalysis/concepts/true_false_self.htm">true 
selves</a>. We also need to fit in with society and so wear masks that project 
social conformance. Masks lie, however, hiding our true selves, albeit with 
fair purpose in protection and acceptance. They are useful in being largely-positive 
forms of <a href="../../explanations/behaviors/coping/coping.htm">coping 
mechanism</a> that help us to handle the difficulties of social life. </p>
<p>My Mask Theory of Eccentricity identifies three styles of eccentricity: Ego, 
Fear and Truth. Although these are not mutually exclusive and any eccentric may 
have a combined reason for being so, many will tend more towards one basic 
driver of their eccentric ways. </p>
<p>None of these styles is bad, by the way. Eccentrics are human too and usually 
moderate how they behave so they do not harm others. Indeed, eccentrics can be 
popular as 'interesting people' and often have the advantage of tacit social 
permission to break more rules than 'normal' people. </p>
<p>The styles may also be deliberate or unconscious. The self-aware eccentric 
knows the effect they have on others and either adopts the eccentric mask for 
deliberate effect or does not mind how it affects others. Many eccentrics, 
however, do not realize the impact they are having and are either confused by 
the way others respond to them or are blind to the social effects of their 
eccentricity.</p>
<h3>Ego</h3>
<p>There is a pattern of eccentricity which is often (and wrongly) assumed as 
being so for all eccentrics, in which the person seems to have a large ego. 
People with a strong sense of self also have strong
<a href="../../explanations/needs/identity.htm">identity</a> needs and 
eccentricity feeds this by allowing the person to stand out and be different 
from others. Being different may also get them attention that also boosts the 
ego. We tend to notice 
and remember people that stand out, and wearing an eccentric mask will, almost 
by definition, get attention. </p>
<p>Ego-eccentrics who also seek social acceptance need to be careful in sustaining 
this by being only moderately different: there is a fine line between difference 
that attracts and difference that repels. Some may even leverage their 
difference to take leadership roles, playing on the courage and outspokenness 
needed to adopt this position.</p>
<h3>Fear</h3>
<p>In the fear model of eccentricity, the eccentric also puts on a mask to 
become eccentric. They may dress differently or join fringe social groups or 
just act in unusual ways and seem on the outside to be larger than life, yet on 
the inside, they are timid and fearful. The mask of eccentricity acts as a <i>
distraction</i> for them, rather than the attraction of the ego-eccentric, 
drawing away their own thoughts from their fears as they inhabit the seemingly 
outgoing persona. As a reversal of timidity, the strategy is also often very 
effective at fooling others into thinking the eccentric is happy and outgoing 
when they are really cringing inside.</p>
<p>Fear-based eccentricity can be particularly unnerving for others, when the 
person combines it with some of the more destructive
<a href="../../explanations/behaviors/coping/coping.htm">coping mechanisms</a>. 
Particularly when coupled with a demanding ego-eccentricity such characters 
can give true eccentrics a bad name.</p>
<h3>Truth</h3>
<p>The third style of eccentricity is fundamentally different to those based in 
ego and fear, although externally it can be initially difficult for others to 
understand this difference. In the truth style of eccentricity, the person 
becomes eccentric by <i>taking off </i>masks. They often know they need to wear masks 
for everyday social interactions and do not need to put on extra masks to boost 
their ego or hide their fear. When they get home and when they are with friends, 
they can show more of their true self which, unsurprisingly, is unique, 
nonconformist and generally quite delightful.</p>
<p>Masks are filters and we see the world through them. True eccentrics, in 
removing masks see more truth, which is another reason for taking down the 
facade. With an open curiosity and a disregard for rules in which they see no 
value, true eccentrics are fearless explorers. A conversation with a true eccentric is 
likely to be wide-ranging and may jump around from topic to topic as the 
butterfly of thought makes new connections.</p>
<p>The most natural of eccentrics wear few masks ever. What you see is what you 
get and who they are. They speak the truth as they see it and are comfortable in their own skin 
with little need for disguise. Curiously, such people are often liked and 
admired, as much because we want to be like them but are too fearful or caught 
up in ourselves to let go. True eccentrics who do not fear others are more 
accepting of them, including those of us who feel unable to expose our inner 
selves. This acceptance also contributes to the affection that true eccentrics 
receive.</p>
<p>Many of us still wear masks when we are with friends, and friendships can 
be based&nbsp; more in what we want or fear than concern for the real other 
person. True eccentrics have true friends who accept them for who they are, even 
if they do not conform. </p>
<p>As well as the likable eccentrics there are also the obnoxious ones who 
simply do not care what others think of them and seem to eschew masks or other 
pretence. These may be obsessive visionaries and some of our greatest artists 
and leaders have been this way. Others are really ego-eccentrics who care only 
for themselves or naked fear-eccentrics who respond to others with a
<a href="../../explanations/brain/fight_flight.htm">fight-or-flight reaction</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a member of the <a href="http://www.eccentricclub.co.uk/">London 
Eccentrics Club</a>, which, in the great tradition of London clubs, is a 
friendly gathering of like-minded people. We are also different-minded true 
eccentrics who have no need or desire for the constraints of fear or ego. The 
idea of the club is that as you walk through the door you take off the mask and 
are accepted as you are, a gentle seeker of truth who delights in exploring new 
worlds with others of a similar ilk and with a healthy disregard for limiting 
rules.</p>

<p>&quot;Mask&quot; or &quot;Shield&quot; ?<br>
<br>
It is a dangerous world David, all creatures are resourceful.....sometimes the 
more vulnerable, the more resourceful.<br>
<br>
Perhaps Psychological theory ought to be amended: &quot;....fight or flight or 
mask(shield)...&quot;???<br>
<br>
The larger population is often intimidated by &quot;eccentrics&quot;... they(we) worry 
&quot;what if they know something we don't??<br>
<br>
Again, good article, great perspective. <br>

<i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Hi Peter and thoughtful notes - thank you.</i></p>
<p><i>'Mask' is a term I've seen used elsewhere and it seems to work and 
resonate with people. A mask is a shield when it protects the person from 
attack. It is also a devices that projects a false persona.</i></p>
<p><i>Vulnerable people, especially when cornered (and they may feel that often) 
can indeed be resourceful and surprisingly aggressive when they see no other way 
out. They take off the mask of vulnerability and put on a tiger mask!</i></p>
<p><i>Yes, fight, flight, mask/shield -- all are ways of </i>
<a href="../../explanations/behaviors/coping/coping.htm">coping</a>.</p>
<p><i>And yes also, anyone who is 'not like me' can be scary, even the gentler 
'true' eccentrics who certainly do not intend to scare whilst just being 
themselves.&nbsp; </i></p>

<hr>
<p>Very interesting.&nbsp; I'm working on the French singer Serge Gainsbourg.&nbsp; Do you 
know of him? If you saw the recent film about him you know that the director, 
Joann Sfar, used a life-sized marionette to play Gainsbourg's alter-ego.&nbsp; But 
Gainsbourg in his &quot;real&quot;? life also played with masks, notably via the character 
of Gainsbarre, whom he &quot;invented&quot; to incarnate his more vile social behaviors, 
whereas, according to those who knew him - extremely &quot;pudique&quot; (modest and shy). 
I'm looking in the film at the origin of the &quot;mask&quot; - which seems to stem from 
the anti-Semitic posters of Occupied France.&nbsp; The notion of shame is important.&nbsp; 
(Schandenmask?) But Gainsbourg seems to put forth a socially 
attractive/reprehensible persona to distract from some inner shame.&nbsp; There's a 
strong in-out dialectic going on.&nbsp; May I quote your article? Can you help me by 
sharing some of yours sources?&nbsp; Thanks!&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;-- Ellie</p>
<p>
<i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Hi Ellie. Yes of course you can quote the article. Gainsbourg is known in 
the UK for his sexy sixties song 'Je t'aime' with Jane Birkin. He also played 
with masks in his name (Gainsbourg is not his original name). Sources sent via 
email to you.</i></p>
