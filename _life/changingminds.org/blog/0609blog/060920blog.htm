<p><i>Wednesday 20-September-06</i><h2>Prima donnas, teenagers and transitions&nbsp;</h2>
<p style="text-autospace: none">I work in organizational change and meet up with 
all kinds of resistance, some subtle and some less so. Recently I was in a 
meeting where one woman was resisting change in an unsubtle way. She is 
intelligent and hard-working, but deeply resents any intrusion into her sphere. 
She dominated much of the meeting, despite being one of the least senior people 
there. Some of her arguments were sound, some were flawed and some were purely 
emotional. She alternated in mood from anger to near-tears. She made veiled 
personal attacks on most people there and generally did her own case few favors.
</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none">I recognized the pattern from two other places. 
When I worked in software engineering, I knew a number of 'prima donnas'. These 
were smart engineers who knew just how wonderful they were and who considered 
social niceties as being for people who couldn't hack it. Rude brusqueness was 
thus used to signal intelligence: the smarter you were, the ruder you could be. 
This rudeness was used both to get what they wanted and to repel any attempts to 
change what they did or how they did it. </p>
<p style="text-autospace: none">Another and perhaps related position is in the 
struggling transitional realm of the teenager, where children become all-knowing 
and parents become contemptibly stupid. I'm in this phase with my 
seventeen-year-old son now although, fingers crossed, I think I can see light at 
the end of the tunnel. A simple measure of his position is in his use (or 
threat) of <a href="../../explanations/emotions/emotions.htm">emotional</a> outbursts to get what he wants or resist advice, rather 
than engaging in <a href="../../explanations/emotions/emotion_rationality.htm">
rational</a> discussion.</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none">This similarity begs the question: Is prima 
donna petulance related to teenage arrogance? Are the tantrums of some subject 
experts connected back to earlier issues? I suspect so. We go through life via 
various <a href="../../explanations/learning/learning_stage_theory.htm">stages</a>, and failure to fully navigate the transitional periods can leave 
us with hang-ups that cause continuing problems. This is a key principle in 
psychoanalysis, where the mishaps and misunderstandings in infant development 
are shown to cause issues that follow us for the rest of our lives. Likewise, an 
incomplete transition from hormonal teenage childhood to
<a href="../../explanations/emotions/empathy.htm">empathic</a>, rational 
adulthood can result in an ongoing and self-centred intolerance of others.</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none">With my son, I try to be patient and 
understanding, holding up a mirror in support of his becoming a 
fully-functioning adult. With the woman in work, I likewise am not playing her 
game and use her legitimization of 'straight talking' to play a straight bat, 
<a href="../../techniques/assertiveness/assertiveness.htm">assertively</a> and without embellishment telling the truth that I see. It's still 
not plain sailing, as truth causes more storms, but we are making headway.</p>

<hr>

<h2 style="text-autospace: none" align="center">Your comments</h2>

<hr>

<p>How are you doing ? I am very happy received your answer . And first of all , 
please accept my apology for I made a stupid mistake . I wrongly spelled your 
English name . I feel very sorry about that . Hope you don't mind .<br>
<br>
Second of all , thanks for your encouragement . I will try my best to learn 
English every minutes ...<br>
<br>
Thirdly , I would like to mention about your today's blog . I don't know this 
phrase &quot;Prima donnas&quot; mean . But I don't think the woman's behavior you 
mentioned is proper . Esp during the meeting . On the other hand , as we are 
both female, to some extent&nbsp; I can understand her . You know, she is a 
woman, and sometimes, she would do that kind of things when she have to . <br>
<br>
Honest to you , I was attracted by one of my classmates . I swear ,I never mean 
to offend her . But ,Until now , I have no idea why she was trying make fun at 
me in front of our male teachers . I hate that. But I can bear . Because I also 
know that just because I can speak English , she can't . <br>
...<br>
The last one I would like to say you really have a deep insight into the life. 
No matter what kind of work you do, you had a keen observation towards work and 
life . Of course, I also believe you can handle the gap between you and your son 
. Both of us should know that\'s normal. And remember when we were young, we did 
believe we know everything , didn't we ? <br>
<br>
Ok , so much for today , Good luck !<br>

<p><i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Hello Emma. Don't worry about names. 'Prima Donna' actually means a female 
opera star, but is often used to mean somebody who is vain and temperamental, 
always full of their own importance. Observing life is interesting. So is 
observing yourself!</i></p>

<hr>

<p>Teenagers and Prima Donnas share some characteristics but are actually much 
different. Teenagers are establishing boundaries. A psychologist friend has told 
me that a turbulent adolescence is a necessary precursor to a well adjusted 
adult. Be happy about the turbulence.<br>
<br>
An alternative explanation is that teenagers and very old people tend to be 
obnoxious because they love us dearly and they want to make their going away 
soon easier for us. That thought let me tolerate my teenagers.<br>
<br>
And lastly, for boys, my daughter, a PhD candidate in psychology, tells me that 
there is a small area in the brain that examines current activity and estimates 
future outcomes from that activity. For boys it doesn't even form until they are 
about 18. Thus the ready-fire-aim problem. When you ask, why did you do that and 
they say, I don't know, they are telling the truth.<br>
<br>
The adult prima donnas have just not had anyone hit them back hard enough yet.

-- Don Shaughnessy</p>
<p><i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Good comments, Don, and solidly consoling. Thanks also for the information 
about the male brain. I've got one myself and am still trying to figure it out.</i></p>

<hr>

<p>Can you offer any advice and experience on how to deal with Prima Donnas in 
the IT Workplace? In particular those who seem recalcitrant or inflexible in how 
they work or avoid challenges to their 'expertise'? <br>
<br>
-- Colin</p>
<p><i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Tricky. I was a bit of one myself once, but then I got older and, I hope, 
wiser. The Prima Donna lives mostly in their own head and finds it difficult 
seeing things from other viewpoints. Influencing them often requires lots of 
ego-stroking -- be impressed, ask their advice, etc. You can also challenge 
them, but be prepared for a duel. They are largely driven by peer opinion, 
especially those who they respect most, so you can get to them by this route. As 
a general method, try using
