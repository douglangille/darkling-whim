<p><i>Monday 27-November-06</i><h2>Risky shift, management and outsourcing</h2>
<p style="text-autospace: none">&nbsp;There is an interesting phenomenon that occurs 
in groups and teams called 'risky shift'. What this means is that the the group 
collectively takes either higher- <u>or</u> lower-risk decisions than its 
members would individually take. This is surprising as one might reasonably 
expect some kind of average collective risk being taken.</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none">What appears to be happening here is that 
critical change is occurring in the <i>personal perception of the transfer of 
risk</i>, based on beliefs and concern for the group. Risk homeostasis says that 
we each have a preferred level of risk and will hence be relatively consistent 
in our risk-taking, yet what actually happens is that we assess risk based on 
perception more than reality, which means that the actual risk we may take on 
might vary significantly.&nbsp; </p>
<p style="text-autospace: none">If I care about others in the group and seek to 
sustain group cohesion then I may feel responsible for the risk taken by other 
group members. I thus might personally take on the risk of others, increasing<i>
</i>my <i>felt risk </i>and leading me to seek lower-risk decisions. If 
influential people or the majority of group members feel this way then group 
decisions will be less risky.</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none">On the other hand, if I feel that I am are 
sharing my personal risk with others (and hence lessening my personal 
risk-taking) then I will be more inclined to take gung-ho high-risk decisions. 
Again, the extent to which this happens will depend on the dynamic of influence 
within the group.</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none">This principle may also explain a similar 
phenomenon that occurs in hierarchical management situations. Managers are 
responsible for a wider scope of activity than individuals, which they share out 
with their subordinates. But what happens to the perceived risk? For the manager 
to sustain their personal risk limit they have to either let go of the 
perception, truly transferring the risk to the subordinate, or otherwise act to 
reduce the risk in some way. Both&nbsp;of these approaches can become dysfunctional, 
resulting in what may be considered as poor management.</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none">If I 'let go', transferring risk to 
subordinates, I need to feel it is their risk and not mine. To do this I must 
ensure I am relatively blameless in the event of failure and so might distance 
myself from them, providing them little support and preparing to punish them if 
they fail. I might, for example, claim I am 'empowering' them or complain to my 
manager and others of the incompetence of my staff. At worst I might give them 
work that is doomed to failure and them sack them when the inevitable happens.</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none">On the other hand, managers might try to reduce 
risk by managing their subordinates more closely, setting goals and requiring 
regular reports. Sometimes called 'micro-management', this also helps satisfy 
the need for a sense of control.</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none">Another, perhaps more canny method is to manage 
external perceptions by projecting high levels of apparent risk upwards and 
outwards whilst actually sustaining relatively lower risk work, thus reducing 
personal risk of being judged as a failure when risks do occur.</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none">Games of shifting risk also extend to 
third-party arrangements, for example in outsourcing and general use of 
suppliers. One of the key reasons why companies ask others to do work is to 
shift the associated risks of this activity.</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none">Once this arrangement is made, the company, 
perceiving an apparent reduction in risk, may 'up the ante', for example by 
putting extra load on the supplier with demands for shorter timescales, lower 
costs and changes in requirement. This may significantly increase the risk of 
failure, but the company's managers don't see it as <i>their</i> risk. 
Meanwhile, the game may continue with the supplying company shifting the risk 
again, perhaps to a sub-supplier or perhaps back up to the first company through 
a pre-emptive get-out clause in the contract.</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none">An alternative (and sometimes additional) 
scenario occurs when the original company's managers realize that their 
customers and senior managers will blame any failure on them. The company's 
managers have relatively little understanding or control over what happens at 
the supplier and thus perceive an increase in risk. A typical response to this 
is to seek greater control, with more reviews, meetings, metrics and general 
attempts to gain more control&nbsp;over the supplier's operation, much as the 
individual manager resorts to micro-management. Again the supplier may well 
fight back against this intrusion that might increase their costs and likelihood 
of failure.</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none">So how can managers avoid these dilemmas? The 
first step is to recognize when they are happening. Real and perceived risks 
should be carefully differentiated. Understand also how individuals and groups 
(including yourself) behave around risk, with different responses outside 
preferred risk boundaries. </p>
<p style="text-autospace: none">A critical additional activity is in developing 
and managing real <a href="../../principles/trust.htm">trust</a>. A lot of 
problems arise from the dysfunction of blind trust or paranoid distrust. Real 
trust comes from effective relationships, transparent interactions and ongoing 
evidence of trustworthiness. Any failure is dealt with by short-term reparation 
and longer-term corrective action that prevents recurrence.</p>

<h2 style="text-autospace: none" align="center">Your comments</h2>

<hr>

<p style="text-autospace: none">&quot;What this means is that the the group 
collectively takes either higher- or lower-risk decisions than its members would 
individually take.&quot;<br>
<br>
Presumably the risk taken would not be higher or lower than the most risk taking 
individual or lowest risk taking individual. My guess would be that they would 
represent the end points of the range, and that risk taken would fall inside the 
maximum and minimum, although possibly higher or lower than the average. Is it 
your observation that this is true?<br>
<br>
&quot;Once this arrangement is made, the company, perceiving an apparent reduction in 
risk, may 'up the anti', for example by putting extra load on the supplier with 
demands for shorter timescales, lower costs and changes in requirement. This may 
significantly increase the risk of failure, but the company's managers don't see 
it as their risk. Meanwhile, the game may continue with the supplying company 
shifting the risk again, perhaps to a sub-supplier or perhaps back up to the 
first company through a pre-emptive get-out clause in the contract.&quot;<br>
<br>
So I do a lot of outsource management and I've never observed this kind of 
behavior. Economically speaking it is very much not in my interests to drive a 
supplier or provider to fail unless I'm anti-outsourcing and want it to fail. Do 
you have real life examples of this happening, or this this just a supposition.<br>
<br>
P.S. -- I assume you meant &quot;ante&quot; and not &quot;anti&quot;, or is that another British'ism 
for me to be aware of ;-)<br>
<br>
Overall I would say that a fault in almost all established companies is being 
too risk adverse. By avoiding risk they fail to take timely advantage of shifts 
in their markets, technology, or their business in general. I'll refer you to 
&quot;The Inventor's Dilemma&quot; for examples of this happening.<br>
<br>

<p style="text-autospace: none"><i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Hello Carl and&nbsp; thanks for the thoughtful challenge. I do like a good 
prod. Yes, there is supposition in the article, but there's also experience and 
study. And as you have done, it's intended as much to provoke thinking rather 
than request blind acceptance. </i></p>
<p style="text-autospace: none"><i>On the first point, the group risk level is 
determined both by internal influence and also external situation. A classic 
risky shift happened in the groupthink of Kennedy's staff in the Bay of Pigs 
affair, where they escalated to Defcon 'almost-nuclear-war'. Individually I 
suspect they might not have done this. Consider also how 'normal' people who are 
in crowds that turn into mobs will behave - I'd suspect that there's been lynch 
mobs before now where no individual would do what the mob had done.</i></p>
<p style="text-autospace: none"><i>Personally, I've been in teams and meetings 
where, despite significant work and evidence to the contrary, there is a flight 
into the 'safe' option when difficult change is proposed. For a change manager 
it can be frustrating when they individually agreed beforehand to the change, 
yet together would not ratify this.</i></p>
<p style="text-autospace: none"><i>You're a rational and intelligent outsourcer 
who works in a mature organization and is probably&nbsp; pretty self-aware. I 
have seen decisions driven primarily by cost and with little concern for 
relationships and cultural alignment -- with subsequent difficulties. I 
currently work in a government organization in which some of the actions around 
suppliers (on both sides of the fence) are not conducive to efficient and 
effective working. We are working on this, by the way, but it's not always easy.</i></p>
<p style="text-autospace: none"><i>Risk is indeed generally not well understood 
or managed. I do have Christensen's book and like his ideas.</i></p>
<p style="text-autospace: none"><i>(and pps, you're right, it's 'ante' - thanks 
for the correction (now made).</i></p>
