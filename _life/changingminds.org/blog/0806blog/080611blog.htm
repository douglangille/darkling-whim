<p><i>Wednesday 11-June-08</i><h2>Coaching euphemism</h2>
<p>Of recent years, 'coaching' has sprung from something to do with sports into 
boardrooms and kitchens around the country, in its two main forms. 'Executive 
coaching' seeks to help highly-paid business people to eliminate weaknesses and 
better earn their salaries, whilst 'life coaching' helps more ordinary folks 
cope with everyday pressures. </p>
<p>Many of the methods and techniques used in coaching come from the realms of 
therapy and counselling, which gives a hint at the development of the industry. 
For a long time people in all walks of life have realised that they have had 
difficulties with a number of very human issues, from self-esteem to 
communicating with others. The problem, however was that going to a counsellor 
or therapist seemed like admitting to some kind of mental illness or 
abnormality. With such stigma attached, it is not surprising that many chose 
coping over addressing their internal issues. </p>
<p>But then someone came up with the brilliant idea of calling it 'coaching'. At 
a stroke, the same thing was reframed from something negative to something 
positive. Instead of treating mental illness or deficiency, it was now about 
increasing mental fitness and honing personal skills. A euphemism is a weasel 
word used to soften an unpleasant reality. A reality of life is we're all broken 
and are just doing our best with what we've got, although we hate to admit this. 
Happily, with coaching we never need to, at least not to those who matter most 
to us and our careers. </p>
<p>Coaches thus become confidantes, therapists, challengers, guides or whatever 
works. At the very least, they provide a welcome respite in the frantic day 
where you can be yourself and sound off all you like. .</p>

<h2 align="center">Your comments</h2>
<hr>
<p>Recently, I posted an entry in my blog comparing a good coach to a good 
caricature artist. It's a gift, whether we're talking kids sports or everyday 
encouragement, or paid therapeutic coaching. <br>
<br>
Seeing potential in people, and helping them realize what value they can bring 
the world by excavating it, is an admirable undertaking which is mutually 
inspiring. <br>

<i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>You're right, Gloria. Coaching can be very rewarding (if a bit exhausting at 
times).&nbsp; As with all abilities, there are indeed those for whom it is more 
natural. There are also gateways -- if you lack empathy, you're unlikely to ever 
get good at it.</i></p>
<hr>
<p>But do you think empathy can be learned? Or do you think it's purely a right 
brain dominated thing? Book after book abounds, suggesting that right brain 
thinking can be enhanced by nurturing the creative side, but can empathy, which 
is also a right brain attribute, be developed, by developing other right brain 
skills? I mean for me, when I have had the experience of being treated poorly, 
it makes it all the more likely that I won't pass that treatment on to others, 
because I know how it feels. <br>
<br>
-- Gloria</p>
<p>
<i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>Interesting question. Empathy is a below-the-waterline experience which is 
difficult to learn. I think there is a definite natural spread, with some people 
being naturally far more empathetic than others. I believe women, as a gender, 
have a higher average than men. I also think it's connected with belief, which 
can be changed. If you see others as objects, your empathy will likely be low 
(and maybe the causal link is the other way around). If you see others as 
embodied spirits, your empathy will likely be higher.</i></p>
<p><i>Empathy can still be learned, at the minimum as a technique, observing 
body language and responding appropriately. It is founded on care. Nevertheless, 
those who learn such strategies will never have the deeper natural empathy of&nbsp; 
others.</i></p>

<hr>

<p>You are on the money. &quot;Exceptional coaching&quot; is active listening, empathic 
listening, holding up the mirror to a client, asking questions which both cause 
new thinking but also which better connect the client's feelings and their 
thinking and their action, suggesting frameworks for thinking. If the coach 
takes his or her ego out of the picture (not feeling any pressure to be 
brilliant or helpful, just being there as coach), a climate of safety and 
exploration is created.<br>
<br>
I have more than a dozen CEO coaching situations each month. Some are more 
valuable to the client than others. But there is no other environment in which 
they can safely be completely authentic and open.<br>
<br>
Not one of these people is &quot;broken.&quot; They are, however, under tremendous 
pressure to perform and eager to gain any insight into themselves that takes 
their behavior and performance up a notch and their discomfort down a notch.<br>
<br>
One final note: I do not believe in therapy that ends with the speaking parts. 
As the late Dr. Albert Ellis (founder of cognitive therapy) taught us, there 
must be actions to try in the real world, success or setback and recovery and -- 
always -- learning.<br>
<br>
Just my view.<br>

<p>&nbsp;I am in the process of reading a book entitled, Becoming A Person Of 
Influence, by John Maxwell. I would highly recommend it. It's all about 
encouraging others and being a positive influence in their lives. <br>

<p>Dave,<br>
<br>
Interesting post - in fact, the &quot;coaching church&quot; is broad enough to encompass 
elements traditionally handled by religion e.g. spiritual coaching (google it!)<br>
<br>
Yes, there are certainly traces of therapy and counseling in the coaching 
toolkit, although the fundamentals are that coaching looks to the future and 
doesn't aim to fix what may be &quot;broken&quot;. <br>
<br>
Nonetheless, some coach training schools do attempt to make a distinction 
between coaching, the mental health professions and consulting. In theory, a 
coach should coach and leave the client in no doubt what he/she is 'qualified' 
to do. <br>
<br>
(There may already have been cases in the US(?) where life coaches have found 
themselves in legal trouble when attempting to knowingly coach people on issues 
for which the medical profession has diagnosed therapy or counseling.)<br>
<br>
This is even a risk in executive coaching - the old joke among some exec coaches 
is that all executive coaching becomes life coaching after the first couple of 
sessions! And they're often right.<br>
<br>
Problem is that some exec coaches take on clients who are approaching burnout. 
Attempting to deliver a ROI on the coaching fees by having such a person set 
even more goals, targets etc and then coach/push to deliver can be a bad news 
scene all round...<br>
<br>
Enough of the gloom (I am a career change coach after all !) - the one skill 
that I think a successful coach MUST have is an ability and willingness to 
listen to the client. Goodness knows, nobody else is! <br>
<br>
It's so important that I wrote a blog post on listening skills recently:<br>

<i><b>Dave replies:<br>
</b>I agreed that whilst there's a nominal line between coaching and therapy, in 
practice it can be rather hazy. I used the term 'broken' to mean imperfect, not 
incapable, and there's certainly plenty of execs out there who are a long way 
from perfect. I also think that most of them are doing their best and that if a 
coach can help them (even if it means getting them to attend more serious 
therapy), then it helps the person, their colleagues and their company.<br>
<br>
Listening? Absolutely! It's remarkably uncommon. People say something we're off 
thinking about what we want to say. The gap between listening rate and thinking 
rate is startlingly seductive. Another coaching attribute that several coaches 
have suggested is 'curiosity'. You have to be interested and spot odd patterns. 
I'd also add care.</i></p>
<hr>

<p>I definitely agree with the fact that simply calling something by a different 
name, such as 'coaching' can make someone feel loads better about themselves!
</p>
<p>While everyone has what it takes to care for someone else, not everyone is 
capable of leading a successful coaching program. Which is where coaching 
training comes in! <br>
