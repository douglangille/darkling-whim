Characters</a> &gt; Magical characters</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many stories contain archetypical magical characters who add mystery and 
unstoppable mayhem to stories. By definition, magic lies outside the known laws 
of science and can take many forms, from traditional wizardry to natural and 
religious forces.</p>
<p>Magical characters are sometimes wielders of magic and sometimes the product 
of magic. They may have super-human or magical powers of varying kind, from 
increased strength or intelligence to simple spell-casting ability.</p>
<p>Magical characters are useful devices also for getting the hero into and out 
of a crisis. Just as the hero is about to get slain in an impossible situation, 
for example, the magical character can appear and save them.</p>
<p>There are many possible magical characters. Just a few of them are listed 
here.</p>

<h3><a name="magician"></a>The Magician</h3>
<p>The Magician is a relatively straightforward human character in that they 
have mastered magical arts to some degree (although this degree can vary 
greatly). They may be mercenaries for hire or be in the employ of good or bad 
characters. They may also play a leading role themselves.</p>
<p>Magicians suggest that magic is simply a skill and that we, too, could 
perhaps master its arts, although the grueling apprenticeship needed and 
perhaps the basic talent required may well put us off the thought.</p>
<h3><a name="sorcerer"></a>The Sorcerer</h3>
<p>The Sorcerer is a dark and aloof character whose alignment with good or evil 
may be unclear and perhaps may even prevaricate between the two. They may 
practice real magic or perhaps are illusionists who create the appearance of 
magic. Either way, probing this question can be a dangerous activity.</p>
<p>The Sorcerer represents mystery and reminds us that not all is as it 
seems and that we must be constantly wary.</p>
<h3><a name="sorceress"></a>The Sorceress</h3>
<p>The Sorceress is distant and mysterious and may represent the female 
principle, particularly as viewed from the male perspective. Desirable yet 
unattainable, she has unknown but great powers.</p>
<h3><a name="black"></a>The Black Witch</h3>
<p>The Black Witch is a human who has learned dark arts for which she may pay 
dearly in an after life. Yet this is not our concern as we face her potions and 
spells of control. </p>
<p>Witches can remind us of how aged people appeared to use as a child, with 
their wizened skin and croaking voice. They may remind us of the smell of death 
and bony, probing fingers.</p>
<h3><a name="white"></a>The White Witch</h3>
<p>The Black Witch is mirrored by the White Witch, whose goodness contrasts that 
of the Black, and against whom she may battle or counteract. Witches often live 
alone in distant parts and are visited to gain knowledge, wisdom and potions.</p>
<p>More than a mother figure, the White Witch often has more of the purity of an 
angel or fairy. She is still a scary figure of power who must be treated with 
great respect and thus represents authority of some kind. </p>
<h3><a name="fairy"></a>The Fairy</h3>
<p>Fairies, as small creatures, seem as children, yet they have powers greater 
than their size might indicate (also like children).</p>
<p>Traditional fairies are often wild creatures who live by their own rules and 
use humans for entertainment and sometimes for mating. They are known to steal 
babies and bring them up in fairy ways.</p>
<p>There also is the good fairy who grants wishes and who sits atop the 
Christmas tree, sprinkling happy sparkles and goodness all around. Their 
uncomplicated and simple wisdom reminds us that being good need not be difficult 
and can lead to wonderful rewards.</p>
<h3><a name="oracle"></a>The Oracle</h3>
<p>The Oracle is an all-seeing (often female) character who can predict the 
future. They may be an old hag who casts bones, a Tarot-reading gypsy or a 
gifted and visionary child. </p>
<p>They are visited to gain knowledge such that future plans may be made, yet 
somehow that knowledge has limited value. Typically, the advice given is so 
cryptic that the person does not understand it until it is too late. This can 
add interesting twists to stories, such as where Laius is told he would be 
killed by his son and thus sends
<a href="../../psychoanalysis/concepts/oedipus_complex.htm">Oedipus</a> away -- 
but who later returns unrecognized to fulfil his fate.</p>
<h3><a name="child"></a>The Miraculous Child</h3>
<p>Miraculous children have powers given to them by fate or the gods. They may 
literally perform miracles or otherwise have special powers.</p>
<p>The Miraculous Child may awaken childhood fantasies of omnipotence. It also 
provides for an interesting reversal in stories where the child is superior to 
the adult.</p>
<h3><a name="god"></a>The God</h3>
<p>The God is an ultimate magical character, who may be any combination or 
omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent. They may have unlimited powers to create 
and destroy at will, and may be only kept from unleashing such terror by 
constant veneration and worship.</p>
<p>Gods can seldom be killed, although they may be outwitted or appeased in the 
hero's search for treasure. They may also be charmed into providing necessary 
support, or even take an unrequested interest and provide surprising help (and 
sometimes mischief).</p>
<p>Gods may represent parents in the centrality of their position in people's 
lives and echo a child's view of parental omnipotence. We are indeed children 
before them and thus may be led again through childhood transitions and 
emotions.</p>
<h3><a name="angel"></a>The Angel</h3>
<p>Angels are symbols of pure good. Far more than gods, they are approachable 
and recognizably human in their ways. They show concern and sympathy for us 
mortals and offer hope for the defeat of evil.</p>
<p>Angels are archetypical rescuers who play to the child in us who seeks 
magical rescue from life's ills. Angels also represent the pure good in us and 
we identify with them on this.</p>
<h3><a name="demon"></a>The Demon</h3>
<p>Demons are archetypal evil characters, mirroring the pure good of Angels. 
They seek evil for evil itself in the same way that Angels seek good. In this 
way they are deeply fearful creatures.</p>
<p>Angels and demons also play out stories in our heads, representing the good 
and evil within each of us. Each believes it is right and those who turn to evil 
see demons as proper and wrongly damned.</p>
<h3><a name="immortal"></a>The Immortal</h3>
<p>The Immortal lives for ever and is invulnerable to attack, aging or disease.</p>
<p>We may well envy the Immortal in their cheating of the death we so terribly 
fear, yet they may still be <a href="tragic_characters.htm">tragic characters</a>, 
doomed to watch the mortals they love grow old and die again and again, like the 
BBC's Dr. Who or the movie Highlander.</p>
<p>Immortals may also be disdainful of mortals, with their brief flicker of 
existence and scraping at the toes of wisdom. We look at these perhaps as 
frightful aliens who have forgotten what it is to be human -- and in doing so we 
remember ourselves.</p>
<p>Immortals may have a weakness, as with Achilles' heel, by which they may be 
slain. This gives the hero the chance of slaying Immortal opponents (if they can 
find their weakness) or tragic heros to be killed.</p>
<h3><a name="undead"></a>The Undead</h3>
<p>The Undead are those who were once alive and normal humans, but are now exist 
in a different form that may not be considered as being truly alive, and 
certainly not in the human sense.</p>
<p>Undead include zombies, skeletons, vampires, liches.</p>
<p>The Undead awaken deep fears of death whilst also hinting tantalizingly at 
immortality, albeit in such a horrifying form. We are thus simultaneously 
attracted and repulsed, making them a fascinating character.</p>
<p>Undead characters are often evil, but do not have to be so (for example 
Frankenstein's monster and Angel in the 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' TV series). 
When they are not evil, they may well be a <a href="tragic_characters.htm">
tragic character</a>, living in a cursed state and perhaps yearning for the 
endless sleep or transition of true death. As such they remind us that death is 
perhaps not such a bad thing after all.</p>
<h3><a name="green"></a>The Green Man</h3>
<p>The Green Man in mythology lives in wild places, typically forests, and is 
seldom seen although his influence may be felt through his control of flora and 
fauna.</p>
<p>The Green Man represents the embodiment of nature itself and acts to protect 
the wild places. </p>
<h3><a name="half-animal"></a>The Half-animal</h3>
<p>Half-animals abound in classical stories, with centaurs 
(half-horse/half-man), manticores (man/lion/scorpion), medusas (snake hair) and 
so on. They are often fearsome yet may be good, bad or chaotic.</p>
<p>Half-animals remind us that we are descended from animals and still have 
animal nature in us. They also indicate that we should be respectful of animals.</p>
<h3><a name="golem"></a>The Golem</h3>
<p>The Golem is a machine brought alive. As such, it has little real life of its 
own. This may make it a pitiful creature. It may also make it scary as it lacks 
the sympathy that prevents most of us from harming one another.</p>
<h3><a name="shapeshifter"></a>The Shapeshifter</h3>
<p>The Shapeshifter can change their physical form to appear or become some 
other person or creature. </p>
<p>Some of these, such as werewolves, have a limited and uncontrollable 
transition. This Jekyll/Hyde switch echoes the multiple characters within most 
people and reminds use about our own, chaotic dark side.</p>
<p>Other Shapeshifters can change at will, perhaps to appear as specific other 
people. These typically use this ability for evil intent but also, as with many 
magical characters, may use their powers for good.</p>
<h3><a name="dragon"></a>The Dragon</h3>
<p>Dragons have a special position in the world of mythology. They are often the 
ultimate monster, with no natural enemies, except perhaps man. They are 
typically wise and may be good or evil. Their intelligence makes them a crafty 
foe who may trick the unwary hero, lulling them into a fatal sense of security.</p>
<p>As the greatest of monsters, Dragons can represent our greatest fears (and 
the term is still used as such). If we can slay dragons, then we can reach that 
heroic state of having conquered all fear.</p>
<h3><a name="assorted"></a>Assorted other monsters</h3>
<p>There are a huge range of animal monsters who populate mythology. These can 
have special significance but generally act as worthy opponents for our 
super-human heroes.</p>
<p>A few common monsters include basilisks, chimeras, griffins, hydras, 
minotaurs and sphinxes.</p>
