<p>Love stories are an entire genre of tales, typically about love that starts, 
stops and starts again. Love is often also added to other stories, for example 
where an adventure story has a 'love interest' element.</p>
<p><a href="../../../explanations/theories/love.htm">Love</a> may have sexual 
elements, but this is not necessarily so, for example in pure romantic love, the love of a friend or 
parental love.</p>

<h3>
<a name="loyal"></a>The Loyal Friend</h3>
<p>
The Loyal Friend is a person who loves us for who we are. They do not seek 
anything in return for their loyalty and will forgive us our weaknesses and walk 
beside us through thick and thin.</p>
<p>
Loyal Friends, such as Sam in Lord of the Rings, reflect the friends that we 
would really like. Sadly, life is not like that and friendship generally works 
with a bit more give and take, and those who we thought loyal often only will be 
loyal to a certain level and sometimes will be remarkably disloyal. True friends 
are thus very rare and seeing them in stories reminds us of what we truly seek 
in friendship. Perhaps also it reminds <i>us </i>to be such a loyal friend to 
others.</p>
<h3>
<a name="protective"></a>The Protective Parent</h3>
<p>
Protective Parents will fight tooth and nail to save their children from harm, 
even sacrificing themselves. Mild mothers will become tearing lionesses and 
fathers will become towering heroes to protect their families.</p>
<p>
We all wanted protective parents when we were young and maybe still do in some 
shape or form. Loving protection in stories thus makes us feel warm and good.</p>
<h3>
<a name="innocent"></a>The Innocent Child</h3>
<p>
The Innocent Child is no threat to anyone and thus is first not to be feared in 
any way. When we see the Innocent Child being exploited in any way, it awakens 
in us instincts of the Protective Parent and we want to see the child rescued.</p>
<p>
In stories we may thus either associate with the child as it awakens memories of 
innocence in us or with the rescuers who represent our protective instincts.</p>
<h3>
<a name="maiden"></a>The Maiden</h3>
<p>
The Maiden is a common character in many stories, providing a love interest and 
more. She first represents innocence and naivety that has reached beyond 
childhood. A symbolic virgin, she is pure and can only be won by the pure of 
heart, and thus is a perfect match for the ideal hero.</p>
<p>
She reminds us that youth can perpetuate and of the fragility of innocence. She 
may thus invoke a complex love that combines the protective love of a child with 
the passion of adolescent love.</p>
<h3>
<a name="princess"></a>The Princess</h3>
<p>
The Princess may well have innocent Maiden characteristics, but her defining 
character is aristocracy and high class, where she may be haughty or kind. This 
may be symbolic, where a working-class girl is also a princess. This represents 
the unattainability of the Princess.</p>
<p>
Where she is wooed by a Prince, it emphasizes the proper way of things. Where 
she is won by a commoner, we are reassured that we can reach above our starting 
position in life. Sometimes the two are combined, where the commoner finds he 
has unrealized royalty in his blood, and so justice is done and right found.</p>
<h3>
<a name="prince"></a>The Prince</h3>
<p>
The Prince is often heir to the throne and so has a latent power that may show 
through with a certain arrogance. He takes his position with a natural 
assumption and is easy in command.</p>
<p>
He shares the aristocratic position of the princess and may be her perfect 
suitor, perhaps riding from afar to save her from peril. He may also be the 
false hero, eventually losing to the hero who has a higher integrity.</p>
<h3>
<a name="lover"></a>The Lover</h3>
<p>
The lover is a passionate creature who typically woos with great ardour and 
skill. The male lover wins with fine words and chivalrous acts. The female lover 
wins with beauty and dexterity.</p>
<p>
Lovers often compete for the hand of another, for example where several men try 
to out-do one another to win the affections of a single woman. The winner is 
typically the one who shows the greatest love, which often means the greatest 
self-sacrifice.</p>
<h3>
<a name="beloved"></a>The Beloved</h3>
<p>
The Beloved is the subject of the lover, and may be male or female. They are 
cherished in many ways and may well be put on a high pedestal of perfection. 
When they inevitably fall, it may be to great shock and anguish, though they may 
also then forgiven and pushed back to their exalted place.</p>
<h3>
<a name="star-crossed"></a>The Star-crossed Lovers</h3>
<p>
Star-crossed lovers are those whose relationship and perhaps lives are doomed 
from an early stage. They are thus also <a href="tragic_characters.htm">tragic 
characters</a>. This, by definition, assumes a truth in fate such that the 
future is pre-destined to happen and nothing can change its course.</p>
<p>
Fated characters typically come from different social backgrounds and their 
tryst is often opposed either by general society or by one or more of the 
families involved. For example where a princess falls for a commoner or a 
businessman shacks up with a prostitute.</p>
<p>
This description, based on astrological reading, was first used by William 
Shakespeare in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>.</p>
<h3>
<a name="soulmates"></a>The Soulmates</h3>
<p>
Soulmates are perfectly-matched Lovers who each holds the other as a Beloved. 
There is a common belief that we each have a soulmate somewhere and this is 
perpetuated in this romantic theme in which soulmates may find, lose and re-find 
one another. Together, they are known as the syzygy, as described by the joining 
of anima and animus in
<a href="../../../explanations/identity/jung_archetypes.htm">Jung's Archetypes</a>. 
In <a href="../../psychoanalysis/psychoanalysis.htm">psychoanalysis</a>, perfect 
joining harks back to the one-ness of the
<a href="../../psychoanalysis/concepts/neonatal_phase.htm">neonatal phase</a>.</p>
<h3>
<a name="infatuated"></a>The Infatuated</h3>
<p>
Those who are infatuated take the obsession of love to an extreme and can thus 
become a nuisance or a threat. Their infatuation also blinds them to other 
things and they may fall into traps and worse.</p>
<p>
Perhaps we experienced teenage infatuation and can sympathize with the 
Infatuated person. We may be concerned that the Infatuated person may cross the 
line into the potentially horrific and murderous realm of stalking.</p>
<h3>
<a name="distant"></a>The Distant Admirer</h3>
<p>
The Distant Admirer is a common theme in early adolescence, where the boy or 
girl in the playground admires another child from afar. This is also the place 
where celebrities are worshipped.</p>
<p>
Distant Admirers effectively play it safe, loving without contact and never 
risking the pain of rejection or the anger of betrayal. Many of us admire others 
but do nothing beyond social flirting simply because we or they are already 
attached. Sometimes, however, this innocent chat can lead to more physical 
things and Admirers can become Lovers. </p>
<h3>
<a name="betrayed"></a>The Betrayed Woman</h3>
<p>
'Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned' is a pithy saying that characterizes a 
common form of the Betrayed Woman, who may seek terrible revenge on her straying 
partner, from public humiliation to financial or physical pain.</p>
<p>
Retribution by proxy happens when the woman is too weak or unwilling and villain 
of the piece is punished by fate or some other person.</p>
<p>
Perhaps we have been the Betrayed Woman or perhaps experienced them (or maybe 
even imagined them). Many married men have been kept on the straight and narrow 
way simply by the fear of retribution should they ever give in to their 
procreative desires.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>
<a name="jilted"></a>The Jilted Lover</h3>
<p>
Lovers who have been rejected may act on the basis of betrayal, seeking 
retribution. They may also go through a period of mourning for their lost lover.</p>
<p>
Their high emotional level may make them unstable and can add an unpredictable 
and hence tension-creating element to a story.</p>
<p>
Many of us have been rejected and sympathize with such characters, and perhaps 
what they do as a response. </p>
