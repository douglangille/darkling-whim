<h2><a name="des"></a>The classic villain</h2>
<p>The classic villain is the antithesis of the <a href="heroic_characters.htm">
hero</a>, being bad where the hero is good, selfish where the hero is selfless, 
harming others where the hero saves them.</p>
<p>This opposite-ness is particularly useful in the
<a href="../../../principles/contrast.htm">contrast</a> that it provides between 
the hero and the villain. In this way, they each define the other.</p>

<h2><a name="dis"></a>Villainous characters</h2>

<h3><a name="mastermind"></a>The Mastermind</h3>
<p>The Mastermind does not commit the crime, but is the brains behind the big 
event, whether it is a stealing, a scam or some other crime. They are typically 
brilliantly clever and master planners, allowing for every eventuality including 
being caught in the act.</p>
<p>They may also leave a deliberate signature, such as a rose or some other 
symbol, to taunt the police and show that they cannot be caught.</p>
<p>The hero who captures the mastermind must outwit them at every turn, 
including avoiding the snares and false trails that the mastermind leaves 
behind. Moriarty, for example, is the mastermind that is the nemesis of the 
brilliant Sherlock Holmes.</p>
<h3><a name="thief"></a>The Thief</h3>
<p>The Thief steals, often from a remarkably secure environment, somehow 
overcoming the security systems that protect the wonderful treasures kept there. 
They are dextrous and agile, able to get past any defence. The lone thief may 
also be clever enough to be classed as a Mastermind.</p>
<p>Thieves are seldom violent and their villainy is based in their lack of 
concern for the rights of property of others. When they are involved in combat, 
their agility and precision can make them very dangerous.</p>
<p>The hero who defeats the Thief is a detective, discovering the clues that 
others miss and piecing together the jigsaw of how the crime was committed and 
how to find the Thief. The Thief story is thus a cerebral one, where the hero 
outwits the Thief's mental dexterity.</p>
<h3><a name="robber"></a>The Robber</h3>
<p>The Robber is less subtle than the thief and may work in a gang with others. 
Where the thief is precise, the Robber is clumsy. Where the thief waits until 
people are away, the Robber will steal from the person's body.</p>
<p>The hero who catches the Robber may do so by entrapment, into which the 
Robber walks unawares. Other methods of capture include basic police work.</p>
<h3><a name="thug"></a>The Thug</h3>
<p>Below the Robber in the intellectual order of villains is the Thug, who gets 
what they want simply though physical violence. </p>
<p>They seldom work alone, needing direction from elsewhere and may act as 
guards or a human battering-ram into the fortress where the treasure is kept.</p>
<p>Defeating the Thug is relatively easy if you can dodge their heavy-handed 
blows. Their slowness and size makes them a simple target for a quicker 
opponent. Otherwise they can be easily outwitted ('Goodness, look at that!' -- 
whack!!).</p>
<h3><a name="sneak"></a>The Sneak</h3>
<p>The Sneak is known for their dishonesty and general lack of
<a href="../../../explanations/values/values.htm">values</a> (it's not that 
other villains lack them -- it is more that the sneak has even less). They will 
work for whoever pays them. They thus make good double-agents -- as long as your 
offer remains the most attractive.</p>
<p>They are often very cowardly and will squeal easily under pressure. Their 
tendency for lying, however, makes what ever they say difficult to believe.</p>
<p>The Sneak is defeated first by never trusting them wholly and then by buying 
them off. </p>
<h3><a name="trick"></a>The Trickster</h3>
<p>The Trickster is a mischievous character who is not what might first be 
envisaged. They often have their own agenda and may be the main Villain or a 
distraction that adds confusion to the story.</p>
<p>Tricksters sometimes play tricks simply to entertain themselves so they can 
marvel at their own ability and domination over others. They also may set traps 
to ensnare the unwary and ply false trust to lead the naive astray. The Hero is 
always on guard and defeating the Trickster demonstrates intelligence as well as 
bravery or skill.</p>
<p>The Trickster reminds us not to trust people and that not all is as it seems.&nbsp; 
Their deviousness and the uncertainty of their actions shows that sometimes 
people behave in unpredictable ways and for unknown reason. </p>
<h3><a name="knave"></a>The Knave</h3>
<p>The Knave is a higher-class rogue who has uses his aristocratic position to 
get what he wants, including favors from a lady. He may promise much in return, 
but in fact gives nothing.</p>
<p>The hero defeats the Knave by exposing his deception. He may also have to 
battle the Knave who, lacking honor, may again use deceptive methods here.</p>
<h3><a name="assassin"></a>The Assassin</h3>
<p>The Assassin is a dark and secret person who kills to order. Their killing is 
not the open murder of others but a hidden delivery, perhaps with poison or 
distant rifle. When up-close, they prefer the dagger, which may be hidden before 
use and closely controlled in action.</p>
<p>Defeating assassins is difficult as they are very skilled in their art. When 
they do not wish to be found they can be almost invisible. Sometimes it is 
easier to defeat the person who commissioned the Assassin.</p>
<h3><a name="lovable"></a>The Lovable Rogue</h3>
<p>The Lovable Rogue is a sympathetic and attractive character who is steeped 
with charisma. They somehow balance selfish acts with sudden and unexpected 
generosity and kindness that endears them to us.</p>
<p>We (and story characters) thus have a love-hate relationship with them as we 
wish that they would improve the integrity. In some ways we also envy them their 
freedom as they make their own rules in the world.</p>
<h3><a name="false"></a>The False Hero</h3>
<p>The False Hero is a a deceptive person who seeks to usurp the glory of the 
real hero, either by claiming to having done what the hero did or otherwise 
claiming some other greatness that overshadows the hero.</p>
<p>The False Hero often seeks the same end as the Hero, such as the hand of the 
princess, making it a zero-sum, win-lose game. In the end, they may have to 
fight to prove who is the true hero, and where perhaps the underhand, non-heroic 
methods of the False Hero exposes reality. </p>
<h3><a name="bad"></a>The Bad Boy</h3>
<p>The Bad Boy is a naughty child who does wrong. The Bad Boy may know what they 
are doing and be well on the road to evil, or they may be going through a phase 
and are still redeemable.</p>
<p>We all know Bad Boys of some kind, and perhaps we recognize ourselves in some 
of the variants. Because they are children, they may evoke some sympathy, 
particularly if they have not yet gone completely bad.</p>
<h3><a name="evil"></a>The Evil Genius</h3>
<p>The Evil Genius is a very clever person who has turned their ingenuity to 
selfish and harmful means. They are often also Mastermind, getting others to do 
their bidding. They may also work for another, such as the inventor of dastardly 
devices.</p>
<p>The audience may be aghast at the perversion of a good mind and at the bad 
that can be done by it. Like a gun, a brain can do good or evil. </p>
<h3><a name="nemesis"></a>The Nemesis</h3>
<p>The Nemesis is the exact opposite of the <a href="heroic_characters.htm">Hero</a>, 
seeking to beat them at their own game. Where the hero is a Genius, the Nemesis 
is a Mastermind. Where the hero is a Warrior, the Nemesis is also likely to be a 
fighter.</p>
<p>Moriarty, for example was the Nemesis for Sherlock Holmes, matching his 
intellect and cunning.</p>
<p>The Nemesis scares the Hero and the audience perhaps more than any other 
villain as the hero's defining characteristics are cancelled out. </p>
<h3><a name="psychopath"></a>The Psychopath</h3>
<p>The Psychopathic villain has the classic symptom of psychopathy, being a lack 
of empathy for others, combined with a cunning that manipulates people in 
unbelievably callous ways. The Psychopath may thus appear to be good, right up 
until the moment of betrayal (making them very difficult to detect and defeat), 
after which they show no remorse at all.</p>
<p>Psychopaths scare us as they indicate that anybody might fall into the same 
category. More than others, they trigger the anger and
<a href="../../../explanations/trust/four_justice.htm">retributive justice</a> 
of <a href="../../../explanations/trust/effects_of_betrayal.htm">betrayal</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="fanatic"></a>The Fanatic</h3>
<p>The Fanatic is single-minded person whose crime is seldom of the traditional 
variety (robbery, etc.). They may well driven by religion or some other ideology 
that gives them the fervor to carry out their mission.</p>
<p>The Fanatic is difficult to defeat as they typically put their mission above 
their own safety and will fight like a Madman.</p>
<h3><a name="traitor"></a>The Traitor</h3>

<p>The Traitor is the archetypal betrayer, seeming to be on your side but 
eventually betraying you to the enemy. Their reasons may be that they are spies, 
they are bought by the enemy or that they are actually good, but they are 
blackmailed into their treachery.</p>
<p>Defeating Traitors may occur if they are detected before their treacherous 
act, but is usually afterwards, when they may be caught as they try to hide or 
escape.</p>
<h3><a name="mon"></a>The Monster</h3>
<p>The monster is a creature that seems or is intelligent enough to have evil 
intent attributed to it. Archetypally this is a dragon who destroys towns, 
hoards gold and captures maidens. </p>
<p>Monsters may also be:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Mythological creatures such as Medusa or Cyclops.</li>
	<li>Folklore creatures such as werewolves or vampires.</li>
	<li>Religious monsters such as demons and devils</li>
	<li>Aliens from another planet.</li>
	<li>Fierce real creatures such as wolves or bears.</li>
	<li>Humans or people who have become so distorted by their evil that they 
	seem as monsters.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="oth"></a>The Other</h3>
<p>The <a href="story_other.htm">'Other'</a> is a critical and 
possibly mysterious other person that throws heroes and main characters into 
relief. They may be villains or reflections of the hero, including anti-heroes 
and those with aspects of the hero's darker side.</p>
<p>The principle of the 'other' comes from
<a href="../../psychoanalysis/psychoanalysis.htm">Psychoanalysis</a> and
<a href="../../../explanations/critical_theory/critical_theory.htm">Critical 
Theory</a>, and hence has a deep and complex attribute system. </p>
