<h2><a name="neu"></a>Neutrality</h2>
<p>In much of life the people we meet are not particularly concerned with us. 
They have their own goals and are pursuing these with the energy that they 
choose and the abilities they have. They are not necessarily good or bad in the 
sense of supporting or opposing us -- they just don't care beyond normal human 
values that dictate civility with others.</p>
<p>When our paths cross with neutral characters, we may find mutual benefit, we 
disagree or may otherwise interact in some way. Neutral characters can play many 
different roles in stories, challenging the Hero or providing unexpected and 
perhaps accidental support.</p>

<h2><a name="cha"></a>Neutral characters</h2>
<p>Here are just a few of the neutral characters that can be found in stories.</p>
<h3><a name="king"></a>The King</h3>
<p>The King is the ultimate ruler whose position both requires and enables 
terrible decisions and commands. He has gravitas and all may be cowed before 
him. The King is also the ultimate symbol of order, and how strongly he rules 
determines the extent of order or chaos in the kingdom.</p>
<p>As a symbolic character, he is not necessarily a real king, and may be a 
company manager or gang leader. Within a family, the father is usually the king. 
The key indicator is that within a given social order, he is at the top of the 
pile.</p>
<p>In some stories, he provides the motivation, sending the Hero on the quest 
and perhaps offering the hand of his daughter, the Princess as a reward.</p>
<p>The King may occasionally be challenged by usurpers who would take his crown, 
leading perhaps to civil war. He also may set his barons against one another to 
distract them from cohesive revolt.</p>
<h3><a name="queen"></a>The Queen</h3>
<p>The Queen sits at the right hand of the King, the other part of the 
symbolically perfect royal couple. She is the mother of the nation to the King's 
father, adding softness to balance his hardness. Elegant and beautiful, she 
achieves her goals more through charm than position. </p>
<p>The Queen may also rule alone, in which case she takes on more of the 
positional power of the King and has a corresponding harder edge.</p>
<h3><a name="fool"></a>The Fool</h3>
<p>The Fool, in the best Shakespearean sense, is a long way from being a fool. 
Intelligent and wise, they literally live on their wits. They will speak the 
truth, though often in riddles. Their fooling may risk the ire of others, but 
they have the protection of the king.</p>
<p>Below this arch-Fool, other Fools provide humor and levity that break up 
the serious action with moments of relief. They may also speak with the voice of 
an Innocent, seeing and saying that which others may not. </p>
<h3><a name="guardian"></a>The Guardian</h3>
<p>The Guardian acts as a gateway, a doorkeeper that will not let you pass over 
a boundary. This may be to something specific or may simply to be to the next 
stage of the journey. They are driven by the pure goal of guardianship and will 
prevent by physical force, magic or whatever power they have, which may well be 
significant.</p>
<p>To get past a Guardian, the Hero may have to fight them. They may also have 
to solve a puzzle or go on some sub-quest or other diversion. Whatever it takes, 
the Hero must do what is required. </p>
<p>The Guardian may thus test the Hero, allowing them to demonstrate their 
determination and prove skills that will be needed on the road ahead. Guardian 
sub-adventures thus provide mini-stories of their own.</p>
<h3><a name="go-between"></a>The Go-between</h3>
<p>The Go-between acts as a shuttle mediator between two characters who are 
unable or unwilling to speak directly to one another. The Go-between acts as a 
voice for each, enabling them to be heard.</p>
<p>The may go between Hero and Villain, Ordinary Person and King, or between man 
and woman who have argued or perhaps not yet met and fall deeply in love.</p>
<p>The Go-between may thus act in a supporting role but their motivations may be 
their own. By stepping back from the action, they allow people who are separated 
to hear what the others is saying, untainted by the Go-between's opinion.</p>
<h3><a name="sage"></a>The Sage</h3>
<p>The main attribute of the Sage is Wisdom, which they offer when they believe 
it is wise to do do. Women do get a look-in, for example as the 'wise old 
woman', but men do seem to get the lion's share of leading roles as Sages.</p>
<p>They can easily play in a support role, typically as Mentor, but may also be 
detached and aloof, offering wisdom to those who are wise enough to seek it. 
Sages often turn up when they are needed and disappear again afterwards, such as 
Gandalf in Lord of the Rings.</p>
<p>The Sage will advise the Hero but seldom directs them. Their sagacity may 
thus be shown to be worthwhile through letting the Hero make the final choice.</p>
<h3><a name="oracle"></a>The Oracle</h3>
<p>The Oracle predicts the future, but not always in a way that the Hero 
interprets or expects. Stories may thus revolve around the Hero's 
misunderstanding of the ambiguous forecast. Curiously, Oracles are often women, 
perhaps associating them with 'women's intuition'.</p>
<p>Macbeth, for example, assumes the witches' forecast that he will be slain 
when 'Burnham Wood walks to Dunsanane' as meaning never -- but what actually 
happens is that Duncan's men use branches from the trees as moving camouflage.</p>
<p>The Oracle may be played by a Witch or perhaps a member of the party who gets 
taken over by some strange force. They may be a Medium for supernatural beings 
or have an unexplained ability to see the future. In 'Back to the Future', the 
main character, having gone back in time acts as an Oracle.</p>
<h3><a name="narrator"></a>The Narrator</h3>
<p>The Narrator tells us what is happening, in case we have not worked things 
out from the action. This can be very useful in complex storylines, helping us 
get back on course and make sense of what has happened. They thus act as an 
embedded storyteller.</p>
<p>The role of Narrator may be taken by any character, who may even speak 
directly to the movie camera. They may also be a disembodied voice that explains 
what is happening.</p>
<p>In the Star Trek stories, the 'captain's log' is used as a way of reminding 
us what has happened and adds detail of the captain's thinking, again helping us 
makes sense of what will happen next.</p>
<h3><a name="distract"></a>The Distracter</h3>
<p>The Distracter pulls the Hero off the main path, perhaps appearing initially 
as a Giver or maybe as a false Villain. In any case, we (or just the Hero, if we 
are in on the Distracter's falsehood) are fooled into thinking that this is the 
right way to go. Sometimes the Distracter is a completely innocent person who 
gets caught up in the action and whose denial of involvement is taken 
incorrectly as evidence of their association with the Villain.</p>
<p>Distractions can be very short-term and temporary and may be a long-term 
confusion. Done well, they add tension and richness to the story, reflecting the 
way that life's journey is not always straightforward. </p>
<h3><a name="scapegoat"></a>The Scapegoat</h3>
<p>The Scapegoat holds the unfortunate position of being to blame for pretty 
much anything. People find themselves in this role in life and it can also 
happen in stories. </p>
<p>Story Scapegoats may be useful ways of explaining why things happened and who 
did things. Motivations may be allocated and the Scapegoat identified. After 
all, in stories truth is what the storyteller says is true. Scapegoats can be 
useful for tidying up loose ends and removing unclear tensions. They may also be 
the main culprits for critical actions.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is realized that the person initially thought to have committed 
the crime is not the real culprit. This is a common turning point and perhaps we 
feel a little sympathetic guilt or maybe turn the tables and point haughtily at 
the characters who jumped to the wrong conclusions. </p>
<h3><a name="taker"></a>The Taker</h3>
<p>The Taker wants something for themselves and will seek to acquire it, often 
by fair means but sometimes by foul also. They may well be Machiavellian in the 
way that the ends of ownership justifies the means of acquisition.</p>
<p>Takers may capture treasure, attention and affection. Anything they want, 
they take. Children may fulfil this role, where they play by the simple rules of 
'if I hold it, it is mine'. </p>
<p>Takers provide distraction in stories and may be third parties, taking what 
both the Hero and Villain are also seeking. In this way, the Hero and Villain 
may be curiously united for a time in capturing the Taker or at least retrieving 
what they have taken.</p>
<h3><a name="free"></a>The Free Spirit</h3>
<p>The Free Spirit marches to a different drum, seeing the world through 
independent eyes and going their own way and with their own rules. This freedom 
gives reason to unexpected behavior and may legitimize actions outside of norms 
and even the law.</p>
<p>The Free Spirit may flit through the story, adding delight and distraction. 
The goal of some Heroes is to catch the Free Spirit, for example where the male 
Hero wins the heart of the free-spirited woman.</p>
<p>We may well envy the freedom of the Free Spirit yet find them attractive and 
delightful characters. </p>
<h3><a name="enforce"></a>The Enforcer</h3>
<p>The Enforcer enacts the law or rules of some sort. Their loyalty is thus to 
those rules and not to any side in the story. The police are often enforcers and 
may give chase or hinder the Hero or the Villain, depending on who has broken 
the laws at this time.</p>
<p>The Enforcers reassures us that order will prevail and that Villains will 
eventually be brought to justice. Sometimes their stupidity in hindering the 
Hero frustrates us, but we do not think them bad -- just perhaps ill-informed 
and blinkered.</p>
<h3><a name="enfant"></a>The Enfant Terrible</h3>
<p>The Enfant Terrible acts in a highly unconventional manner, not because they 
are bad but because they have different motivations and values. They typically 
do little or no direct harm but can be embarrassing and difficult to handle as 
they do not obey normal social rules.</p>
<p>Groucho Marx played an Enfant Terrible in his movies with his brothers, 
making light of everything and playing the fool for his own entertainment.</p>
<p>The Enfant Terrible adds confusion and uncertainty to the story and may also 
contribute a certain amount of comedy as their antics upset various applecarts.</p>
<h3><a name="slayer"></a>The Slayer</h3>
<p>The Slayer's main purpose is to kill, but within rules that take no notice of 
good or bad. The Slayer may thus be a mercenary, not aligned to any side but 
simply working for the highest bidder. Slayers may also be Guardians, acting to 
kill all who try to pass a point or take a treasure.</p>
<p>The cold killing of the Slayer frightens us. It also reassures us and makes 
us feel safe when they slay on our behalf.</p>
