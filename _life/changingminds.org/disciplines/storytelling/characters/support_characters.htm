<h2><a name="def"></a>Defining the support character</h2>
<p>Support characters, as oppose to other characters, are motivated in some way 
towards helping the hero on the quest. </p>
<p>As many of us put ourselves first, at least in some key respects, it can be 
suspicious when one person dedicate themselves to another, perhaps even unto 
death. But prosocial behavior does happen and love does not have to be sexual or 
gender-based. Support characters typically gain support for their sense of
<a href="../../../explanations/needs/identity.htm">identity</a> through
<a href="../../../principles/association.htm">association</a> with the Hero. </p>

<h2><a name="sup"></a>Support characters</h2>
<p>There are many characters who can play in a support role. Here are just a 
few...</p>
<h3><a name="party"></a>The Party</h3>
<p>Although not a single support character, the Hero is often aided by a group 
of people who form the Party (the Gang, the Companionship, etc). </p>
<p>The Party may be highly cohesive, with a single and clear aim, or may be a 
relatively collective who work together because of some mutual benefit, from 
safety to dislike of the villain. a False Party may be formed where characters 
work together to find a treasure, whilst each seeks to deceive the other at the 
last minute to carry the treasure away for themself. </p>
<p>The Party is often made up of complementary characters, each of whom 
contributes something to the story. Although they may be heroic, typically none 
of these is as brave or skilled as the main Hero, thus highlighting the Hero's 
remarkable qualities.</p>
<p>If we do not identify well with the Hero, the Party gives us a choice of 
support characters with which to associate.</p>
<h3><a name="faithful"></a>The Faithful Companion</h3>
<p>The Faithful Companion dedicates themself to supporting the main character, 
who they define as superior in some way. They often feel honored to be in the 
place they are, with the opportunity to support a great person.</p>
<p>In the Lord of the Rings, Samwise Gamgee is an archetypal Faithful Companion, 
carrying Frodo on his back when Frodo is unable to work and even staying 
faithful when Frodo rails unkindly against him.</p>
<p>Companions gain much of the esteem from the reflected glory of the Hero and 
knowledge that they have contributed in ways that perhaps others do not. They 
are grateful for the position of trust and will never betray the Hero, even 
under severe duress.</p>
<p>In stories, we admire the complete integrity of the Faithful Companion and 
perhaps envy the Hero such unstinting support. </p>
<h3><a name="best"></a>The Friend</h3>
<p>The Friend is not as attached to the Hero as the Faithful Companion, but will 
nevertheless put themselves out significantly in the name of Friendship.</p>
<p>In the Lord of the Rings, Merry and Pippin are very good friends of Frodo, 
but do not have the dedicated closeness of Sam.</p>
<p>We often <a href="../../../principles/association.htm">associate</a> more 
easily with Friends than with Companions, as this is a more common role that we 
play. It reassures us that we can indeed have a place in an adventure story that 
is close to the heroic role.</p>
<h3><a name="ordinary"></a>The Ordinary Person</h3>
<p>Help comes from many places and Ordinary People, who are often bystanders in 
the main plot can provide unexpected and significant support.</p>
<p>Most ordinary people have decent values and, when asked to help a good cause 
will help perhaps even beyond what might reasonably be expected.</p>
<p>Many of the the main characters in stories may start out as Ordinary People 
and, through character development and trial take on other roles. Many Heroes, 
in fact, start out as Ordinary People.</p>
<p>More than perhaps all other characters, the Ordinary Person represents us. We 
associate with them, then as they offer increasing support we a vicariously 
proud of their actions.</p>
<h3><a name="father"></a>The Father</h3>
<p>The Father has the archetypal role of Protector. He may also take on roles of 
Teacher, helping the person learn to live in the new world of grown-up 
adventure.</p>
<p>The Father, particularly for a male, is often the target of
<a href="../../psychoanalysis/concepts/oedipus_complex.htm">Oedipal</a> envy and 
adolescent revolt and some villains may have a father element to them. For a 
female, the father plays the Protector role for much longer (though may also 
have some ambiguity, being an 'unattainable male').</p>
<p>When the Hero is older, the Father may add wisdom or perhaps even be a bit 
bumbling, such as the role played by Sean Connery in the Indiana Jones movies.</p>
<h3><a name="mother"></a>The Mother</h3>
<p>The mother is the archetypal Nurturer, providing kind and thoughtful support 
that asks nothing in return. </p>
<p>The <a href="../../psychoanalysis/concepts/good-enough_mother.htm">Mother</a> 
is the earliest carer in a person's life and has deep and original significance. 
For a male she represents early
<a href="../../psychoanalysis/concepts/desire.htm">desire</a> and loss (through 
the <a href="../../psychoanalysis/concepts/oedipus_complex.htm">Oedipus Complex</a>). 
For the female, she may be both Companion and Friend, against whom males 
(including the Father) are a separated species.</p>
<p>Parent figures thus have deep
<a href="../../psychoanalysis/psychoanalysis.htm">psychoanalytic</a> meaning and 
tug at ancient neonatal memories.</p>
<h3><a name="kin"></a>The Kin</h3>
<p>Beyond parents, blood ties leech off through siblings, grandparents, cousins 
and so on. The critical aspect of Kin is that there is a duty of care on both 
sides. Cousins are not supposed to fight one another. Aged grandparents must be 
cared for, whilst their wisdom is listened to and preserved.</p>
<p>Stories thus may include both the good support that comes from Kin and the 
obligations fulfilled to Kin. Stories may also come from Kin actions that are 
non-supportive, such as family feuds and family members who take different paths 
in life.&nbsp; </p>
<h3><a name="nurturer"></a>The Nurturer</h3>
<p>The role of the Nurturer is to provide emotional support to the Hero, who may 
well be suffering significant stress during the adventure. Within a party, the 
Nurturer provides general support to others and helps to keep up the general 
spirit. When anyone is ill or depressed, the Nurturer will be there to help 
them.</p>
<p>This role may be played by a Mother or other Kin, such as a sister. It can 
also be played by a Companion or Friends. A Leader may take on Nurturing if it 
is needed.</p>
<p>In stories, we are grateful to the Nurturer for providing much-needed support 
and humanity in what may sometimes become an inhuman trial. </p>
<h3><a name="tea"></a>The Teacher</h3>
<p>The Teacher helps the Hero learn and develop the knowledge and skills needed 
to complete the adventure. The Teacher may thus be a swordmaster, a Thinker, a 
Magician or other.</p>
<p>The Teacher help the Hero and party grow and develop and hence become 
three-dimensional characters. They often take the form of an old man, such as 
Obi Wan Kenobi in Star Wars or Gandalf in Lord of the Rings. In a reversal, an 
Innocent can also take on the Teacher role.</p>
<p>As observers, we also may learn from the Teacher and this may well be 
intentional on the part of the storyteller. It can be easier to learn from 
characters in a story than be criticized for our own actions. Stories thus can 
form very useful teaching tales.</p>
<h3><a name="thinker"></a>The Thinker</h3>
<p>The Thinker provides the brain-power for the Hero and the party, alerting 
them to unthought-of issues and finding solutions to tricky puzzles. They 
'un-stick' the plot when everything seems lost, finding ways forward that nobody 
else could credibly find.</p>
<p>Thinkers may be academic geniuses who seem to live on another planet or they 
may be pragmatic and hands-on practitioners whose knowledge and ability is based 
on a long experience. Sometimes they are the Hero, as in Sherlock Holmes and 
sometimes they act in a support role.</p>
<p>Thinkers help us sometimes as an effective Teacher (a role which they may 
also take on), showing what was not obvious. Stories may be a series of puzzles 
that we are invited to resolve, such as detective stories. When we find the 
solution ahead of the Thinker, we may be rightfully delighted.</p>
<h3><a name="doer"></a>The Doer</h3>
<p>In contrast to the Thinker, the Doer is an all-action person who acts first 
and worries about the consequences later. </p>
<p>Heroes are often Doers, leading the main action of the story. Doers may also 
be Warriors or other action-oriented roles. They also may give opportunity for 
lessons around thinking before acting as they get themselves into unwise 
scrapes.</p>
<p>As observers of the story, we are grateful for the Doers who provide action, 
heroics and comedy. It is through their actions that the plot gathers pace and 
interesting things happen.</p>
<h3><a name="doubter"></a>The Doubter</h3>
<p>The Doubter expresses uncertainty about some aspect of the quest, whether it 
is the skills of the Hero, the validity of information received or the overall 
likelihood of success.</p>
<p>The Hero or others in the party may go through a period of doubt as they 
consider the size of the challenge ahead. This validates doubt as an expression 
of humanity and gives reality to their struggle, making their final conquest 
even more heroic.</p>
<p>Doubters have a role in highlighting the virtue of those who never lose faith 
in the Hero or the quest. In the New Testament of the Bible, 'Doubting Thomas' 
plays this role.</p>
<p>The Doubter may well reflect our uncertainty as to whether the task may be 
achieved or the validity of other incredulous aspects of the story. Their 
expression of doubt, however, allows these fears to be allayed as others in the 
party can then explain why they will succeed.</p>
<h3><a name="giver"></a>The Giver</h3>
<p>The Giver, also known as the Donor or Provider, has some knowledge or 
artefact that they give to the Hero or some other member of the party. The gift 
takes the story a step closer to conclusion as now the Hero has some tool by 
which the next stage of the quest may be completed or which may be used in 
defeating the Villain.</p>
<p>The role of Giver may be taken by other characters, such as the Teacher, a 
parent or Friend. It may also be a neutral character, such as the Guardian who 
gives the Hero a special weapon after the Hero completes a particular sub-quest.</p>
<p>We are grateful to Givers although they may not play a significant role in 
the story. Unless they are main characters, their time is transitory. 
Nevertheless, they mark transition points and often occur at pauses in the 
action, for example in Lord of the Rings where Frodo is given information about 
the future by Galadriel.</p>
<h3><a name="joker"></a>The Joker</h3>
<p>The Joker provides humorous elements and light relief to the story through 
mischief, joking and other antics. As such, they offer rest points at which we 
can release some tension before the next stage of the story winds us up again.</p>
<p>In Lord of the Rings, Merry (note the name) and Pippin, with their enduring 
sense of fun, provide relief between the major battles and other action scenes.</p>
<p>The Joker can be an ambiguous character, such as Shakespeare's Puck, perhaps 
acting more as a traditional Fool or having a darker side.&nbsp; </p>
<h3><a name="protector"></a>The Protector</h3>
<p>The Protector serves to keep someone or something safe, guarding it at all 
costs (and, as such, is related to the Guardian). Typically, the Protector is 
the primary Warrior in the party or may be assigned to a vulnerable character 
such as the Maiden.</p>
<p>The Protector is often sympathetic as they remind of the Father figure who 
will keep the child in us safe from harm.</p>
<h3><a name="magician"></a>The Magician</h3>
<p>The Magician performs feats that we have no way of explaining. These may be 
deft illusions, technological marvels or may involve 'true' magic, depending on 
the story and the form of magic allowed.</p>
<p>In some ways, the Magician represents hope and rescue, as their seemingly 
infinite powers can be deployed to save any situation. To keep the story tense, 
the Magician often has limitations as to the use or effectiveness of their 
power.</p>
<h3><a name="organizer"></a>The Organizer</h3>
<p>Some stories are wreathed in chaos, rather than being a simple A-follows-B 
sequence. In such tales a key role is the Organizer, who creates order from 
disorder, structure from random uncertainty. Organizers also enact simpler 
tasks, such as managing the logistics of the journey. Organizing can come in 
many shapes, for example detectives such as Hercule Poirot and Sherlock Holmes 
organize knowledge.</p>
<p>The Organizer can be a major role, depending on the story, but often is not. 
The task may also be taken on by one of the party, typically the Faithful 
Companion or a Friend.</p>
<p>Although not necessarily a major role, the Organizer adds credibility to a 
story, anchoring it in the real world and helping to join up the dots of the 
story.</p>
<h3><a name="witness"></a>The Witness</h3>
<p>The Witness can play a key role in stories where they observe from a neutral 
position and are hence arbiters of the truth. Without prejudice, they say what 
they see and are not influenced by social bias or influence.</p>
<p>In the story of the Emperor's New Clothes, the little boy takes on the role 
of Witness when he is the only one to declare that the Emperor is naked. In 
doing so, the adults are permitted to also talk about this. The Witness thus 
legitimizes honesty. </p>
<p>When the Witness writes down what they see, they become historians and 
archivists. When they tell what has happened, they become storytellers and 
narrators. They may even be a disembodied voice that tells the main story and 
comments on the action.</p>
<h3><a name="conscience"></a>The Conscience</h3>
<p>The Conscience of the party acts to remind them of their values and of 
generally held social norms and ethics. This can be particularly significant in 
stories where achieving the goals of the story involves shady dealings and harm 
of others, perhaps even innocent bystanders.</p>
<p>When the Conscience speaks, people may feel guilty, but they do usually 
listen and the audience is reminded how good the Hero and the party is. The 
Conscience may also highlight villainy by talking about how bad the Villains 
are.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for the mission be prioritized above following all social 
values. In this case, the purpose of the Conscience is to remind the audience of 
the over-riding importance of achieving goals such that some values become 
secondary.&nbsp; </p>
<h3><a name="villain"></a>The Turncoat Villain</h3>
<p>Sometimes help comes from the most unexpected places and villains may provide 
help in some form or another, typically giving intelligence about the villain's 
plans, thus allowing the hero to avoid a trap or prepare for a significant 
confrontation.</p>
<p>The most common form of villainous support comes from one of the main 
villain's henchmen who conveniently acquires a conscience. Villains may also 
inadvertently offer support when they err or boast.</p>
