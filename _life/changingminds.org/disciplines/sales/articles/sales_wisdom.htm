<h1>Sales Wisdom</h1>

<p class="smaller" align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="../../disciplines.htm">Disciplines</a> &gt; <a href="../sales.htm">Sales</a> 
&gt; <a href="sales_articles.htm">Sales articles</a> 
&gt; Sales Wisdom</p>

<p class="smaller" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's a collection of sales wisdoms found along the way. If you don't sell, don't
be fooled by the title: although the wisdoms are pointed at sales people, they
are equally applicable in any persuasive situation.</p>

<h2>Start with rapport</h2>

<p>You won't sell anything until you get rapport with the other person. Rapport 
is a state of emotional bonding, where they are aligned with you and vice versa.</p>

<p>If you move, then if you are in rapport, then they will move too.</p>

<h2>Customers don't have needs--they have problems</h2>
<p>A lot of sales training and books tell you about the importance of selling to
customer needs. Although this is basically true, customers don't sit down and
think 'I've got a need'. Instead, they experience problems and hence seek
solutions to these.</p>
<p>The customer has to perceive the problem, of course. You may perceive the
problem, but if the customer doesn't, then there's no way they can bite the
solution line.</p>
<p>So the sales job is about finding, eliciting and solving these
problems.&nbsp;Where understanding of needs does come in useful here is that 
problems appear when needs are not met. But when you talk to customers, it 
usually works best if the subject is problems.</p>

<h2>Urgency is proportional to pain</h2>
<p>Problems are like health. The more a problem hurts now, the more the need for
a solution now. And the more it hurts, the more they'll be prepared to pay for a
speedy solution.</p>
<h2>It's got to hurt enough</h2>
<p>The operation of resolving the pain is itself a painful process, so if the
pain is below this threshold, the patient will prefer to continue to suffer than
accept any treatment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Research has shown that most people will seek a solution when they have three
problems. About a quarter seek solutions earlier, and another quarter seek
solutions later.</p>

<h2>You don't sell products, benefits or solutions--you sell feelings</h2>
<p>Sales used to be about selling products. But a sole focus on products leads
to objections, so&nbsp; sales moved to selling benefits. Better again, the focus
turned to understanding the underlying problem to be solved, but this is still
not the whole story.</p>
<p>When we make any decision, including the 'buy' decision, we do so by an
emotional process. It may not seem that way, and there may be much logical
processing, but the point of decision is always emotional, and usually
subconscious.</p>

<h2>Ask for the sale</h2>

<p>A lot of sales people are so paranoid about the customer saying no that they 
keep on selling long past the close-by date. They may even talk the customer 
into buying and then talk them out again.</p>

<p>The trick is to swallow your fear and ask. When the time comes, ask for the 
sale. Ask 'Are you ready to buy now?'</p>

<h2>Ask for honesty</h2>

<p>Ask them for honesty and you will get it. Ask 'Can you be honest about this?' 
They will say yes, of course. Then you can ask them for critical information and 
you will get the truth.</p>

<p>By asking for honesty, when they say yes then they must then maintain
<a href="../../../principles/consistency.htm">consistency</a> with that 
statement and <i>be </i>honest.</p>

<h2>The best sale seems to be driven by the customer</h2>
<p>Great sales people give so much apparent control to customers that the
customer seem to sell the products to themselves.</p>
<p>They do this by being incredibly sensitive to the customer's situation and
state of mind, then nudging gently with the right questions such that the
customer realizes their need and ends up asking for the product.</p>
<p>They have turned causal conversation into an art, persuading by subtle
inference and influence rather than more overt presentation and persuasive talk.</p>
<h2>Love that customer!</h2>
<p>Love is a funny word that is much misunderstood. Loving the customer doesn't
mean hugs and kisses, but it does mean caring about them both before <i>and</i>
after the sale.</p>
<p>When sales people truly care about the success of their customers, it shows
all over their faces and all over their actions, too. A loving sales person will
never dupe their customers and will always give them a fair deal. Note the
emphasis on fair. That means the sales person gets something out of it too.</p>
<p>It's difficult not to trust someone who loves you. In fact it's difficult not
to love them back, and loved customers often love their sales people. Now
there's a relationship to kill for.</p>
<h2>Be paranoid</h2>
<p>Paranoia is a normal and healthy state. This is as compared with the enormous
dangers of complacency. The sale is never in the bag until the ink is dry. Even
then, customers can often return products. They can also complain like mad and
never buy from you again.</p>
<p>Always assume there's a competitor lurking. Always assume the customer has
not fallen in love with you or your products. Never assume that a sale will fall
into your lap without due and continuous effort on your part.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>You said</h2>
<p>'You told me you wanted a widget? Well here's a great one.' Frequently use
their words, needs, and so on. Use 'You said', 'You mentioned' etc. to make undeniable
connections.</p>
<h2>ABC</h2>
<p>Always Be Closing is a common wisdom, but it isn't always wise. If the
customer is not ready, trying to close them will result in more objections,
often false ones, put up as a defense.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>ABT is better: Always be Testing. Always test that they are with and that you
are with them. Test for outstanding objections and misunderstandings. Test for
commitment. And, yes, test for readiness to close. But only at the right time.</p>
<h2>Handle the transfer</h2>
<p>If the sale involves transferring an account from a previous supplier, the
thought of doing this transfer can block the sale. It's embarrassing to tell
someone you are no longer going to do business with them, and they may want to
try and grab you back. It's also a lot of hassle.</p>
<p>So offer to handle the transfer as a part of the package.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Let them discover things</h2>
<p>There' s a world of difference between you telling them things and them
finding them out for themselves. The difference is ownership and a sense of
identity. If they find a great benefit from your product by themselves, their
identity will connect through the benefit directly to your product. When you
tell them, then they don't get that connection.</p>
<h2>If you don't talk product, they won't object</h2>
<p>If you want to avoid price (and other) objections, stay off the subject of
your product. It's difficult to object to something that is not in the
conversation.</p>
<p>Of course, you will have to talk product at some time, but if you can stay
off it until they are crying out for a solution just like your product, then the
only product conversation will be short and sweet.</p>
<h2>It's not who you know, it's who knows you</h2>
<p>Having a great list of contacts is not much good if you have to explain you
are and rebuild trust levels every time you call them.</p>
<p>When people know and trust you, just the sound of your name will send good
feelings surging through them. They will be ready and willing to do your
bidding.</p>
<p>Not only that, but rather than you call them, they will be calling you, and
telling other people to call you. When people know and trust you, sales turn
from push into pull.</p>
<h2>Be clean</h2>
<p>Physically, that is. Nobody buys from a dirty, smelly, slovenly sales person. 
Your presentation is, literally, a
<a href="../../../explanations/needs/hertzberg_needs.htm">hygiene</a> factor. If 
you are clean, tidy and smell ok, then it may not increase your chance of 
selling, but it will, at the very least, not get in the way.</p>
<p>Shower daily. Wash before seeing clients. Avoid bad breath. Have your suit or 
clothes cleaned often. Make your shoes shine.</p>
<p>The degree to which you polish up will depend on circumstance. If you are 
selling grease guns to mechanics, you don't want to turn up in an Armani suit. 
But you still want to appear tidy and clean. Generally, you want to avoid 
presentation being a block to sales, and maybe being a subtle encouragement as 
people admire how you look and smell. But you don't want to show them up so they 
feel you are 'too posh' for them.</p>
<p>A simple rule: try to avoid your audience noticing what you are wearing. Any 
influence from your clothes should be very largely subconscious.</p>
