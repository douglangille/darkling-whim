<p class="smaller" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>What makes a sales person <i>great </i>as opposed to merely <i>good</i>? The 
answer is first of all <i>drive</i>, a powerful motivation to not only sell but 
sell well and successfully. </p>
<p>Below, <i>Five Drives</i> are presented as essential passions for the sales 
person to achieve greatness.</p>

<span LANG="EN">

<font SIZE="2">
<h2><a name="sel"></a>The drive to sell</h2>
<p>What separates a good salesperson from a great sales person? The first answer is </font>
the

<font SIZE="2"><i>drive to sell</i>. The good salesperson works hard and may enjoy selling, but views the 
work as a job, a means to making money to pay for a desired lifestyle. The great 
salesperson, on the other hand, is
<a href="../../../explanations/motivation/motivation.htm">driven</a> by an
<a href="../../../explanations/theories/intrinsic_motivation.htm">inner</a> 
conviction where their whole <a href="../../../explanations/identity/identity.htm">
identity</a> is defined by selling and their higher goal is simply to be great 
at selling. </p>
<p>Of course, when they are starting out, the great sales person is not great in 
terms of selling, yet they still have the seeds of greatness in them and so may 
yet be considered great. Yet they never truly consider themselves great, even 
after years of experience. And, paradoxically, this is what makes them great. 
Like the golfing champion who still practices long and hard, the great 
salesperson always knows there is room for improvement and earnestly seeks to do 
so at every opportunity.</p>
<h2><a name="lea"></a>The </span>drive<span LANG="EN"> to learn</h2>
<p>Because their driving purpose is to sell (rather than to make money) the 
great salesperson takes every opportunity to
<a href="../../../explanations/learning/learning.htm">learn</a>. This means they 
spend time studying both theory and practice, finding out what really works and 
why. They connect the dots to find both the immediate and the deeper root causes 
of successful selling.</p>
<p>To learn you must be open and never think you know it all. In fact you must 
be always ready to openly consider that your most treasured assumptions are not 
wholly right (and could even be mostly wrong). This requires a humility that 
also helps you in other ways, such as being better able to sense customer needs.
</p>
<p>Because learning is a combination of
<a href="../../../explanations/perception/perception.htm">perception</a>,
<a href="../../../explanations/theories/theories.htm">theory</a>, practice and 
analysis, an <a href="../../../explanations/research/research.htm">experimental</a> 
approach is often the best way to find what really works. This 
does not mean half-hearted &#8216;giving it a go&#8217; that is likely to fail. It is more 
like a scientific experiment with defined actions and analysis of solid data. 
Learning is about true understanding that gives useful results.</p>
<h2><a name="con"></a>The drive to </span>connect</h2>
<span LANG="EN">
<p>The great salesperson sells to people, not companies, prospects nor even 
customers. And to sell to a person you have to
<a href="../../../techniques/conversation/rapport/rapport.htm">connect</a> with 
them at an emotional level, so you feel their inner motivations and they feel 
your concern for them.</p>
<p>Truly connecting with people is a two-way process. It is a joining of 
identities where each feels a part of the other. This can be quite exhilarating 
as the sense of self is expanded. It leads to sharply increased trust that opens 
the door to persuasion. It also increases care for the other person, which 
sharply reduces the temptation to deceive. </p>
<p>This force for honesty is a paradox that holds back the average sales 
person&#8217;s drive to connect. Their job is to sell and, if truth be told, they will 
temper deceit mostly by the risk of discovery and the need for repeat sales. For 
the great sales person, concern for people shapes their whole approach. They 
believe deeply in their products and sell in order to help others. They see 
their customers almost as a family and will sustain connection with them after 
the sale is complete, constantly looking for little ways to help out. When the 
customer is ready to buy again, the great salesperson is then the natural 
choice.</p>
<h2><a name="qua"></a>The drive to </span>qualify</h2>
<span LANG="EN">
<p>The good sales person knows it is a numbers game. Only a certain proportion 
of prospective customers are ready to buy so you have to cast you net far and 
wide, attracting many in order to find the few who will buy. </p>
<p>This mass method makes speed a priority, otherwise the average sales person 
would be swamped by the search for the needle in the haystack. This in turn make
<a href="../qualifying/qualifying.htm">qualification</a> an important process 
and a key goal of the good sales person is to jettison prospects who seem 
unlikely to buy as quickly as possible. This is done order to find those who are ready to 
buy or who can be persuaded with the minimum effort. </p>
<p>Success for the good sales person is a slick, short sales funnel in which the 
goal is to either move prospect on or move them out. While the funnel is wide at 
the top in order to scoop up possible customers, it narrows quickly to keep only 
the probable customers who squirt out of the end, delivering a rapid stream of 
sales.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While the good sales person fishes with a net, the great sales person uses 
a line. They play a long game of connection, treating everyone as a potential 
customer or ally and gradually reeling them in. This is a slower process but it 
leads to an active pool of customers each of which is inching towards their next 
purchase. In this way the great sales person make their numbers more from known people than from 
new customers. </p>
<p>While the good sales person qualifies out, the great sales person qualifies 
in. This is a subtle difference in attention as qualification is both a 
selection and rejection process. The good sales person hates wasting their time 
and so works quickly to remove poor prospects so they can spend more time 
selling to the good ones. The great sales person spends more time finding people 
who may one day buy from them and then connecting with them in ways that will 
subsequently help gentle nudging forward.</p>
<p>The great sales person&#8217;s <a href="sales_funnel.htm">funnel</a> is wide and 
long (and looks more like a pipe than a funnel). Many can enter it and yet few leave 
it. Its wide spout means the great sales person can make their numbers with a 
slower flow rate. This can be perplexing for the good sales person for whom 
speed is key.</p>
<h2><a name="clo"></a>The drive to </span>close</h2>
<span LANG="EN">
<p>All good sales people know the importance of
<a href="../closing/closing_techniques.htm">closing</a>. While doing a good job 
in attracting and qualifying customers is important, it is all for naught if all 
the prospective customer does not buy. The ABC maxim (&#8216;always be closing&#8217;) 
promises that a constant attention to the finish line is the best way of getting 
there as soon as possible.</p>
<p>And nothing quite beats the rush of closure. As the customer signs the order 
or hands over the money, the good salesperson is jumping for joy inside as they 
see targets being met and commission paid. The knowledge that you have persuaded 
another person is pretty thrilling too. This drive leads to the good sales 
person knowing a range of closing techniques and being ready to use what works 
with the customer in front of them. This may involve certain psychological 
tricks but the draw of the close makes these essential tools of the trade.</p>
<p>This drive to close naturally leads to a readiness to negotiate and the good 
sales person is a good deal-maker. They will discount, barter and create 
packages, whatever it takes. They are good readers of people and can see the 
signs that show where a little extra give or pressure will tip the customer into 
agreement.</p>
<p>The great sales person also has a drive to close, though it is somewhat 
different to the hurry of the good sales person. They look more beyond the sale 
to the benefit and satisfaction the other person will gain from their purchase, 
and work steadily to awaken this vision. A useful test of a good sales person vs. 
a great sales person is that customers of the great sales person never suffer 
from 'buyer's remorse.'</p>
<p>Rather than pushing, the great sales person create pull. This works through 
connecting with the customer, their purpose and the product in an integrated, aligned 
structure where the customer sees clearly how the product will help them and 
feels the lack of it as a hole in their lives that can only be filled with the 
purchase. In this process the great sales person not only affects how the 
customer behaves in buying the product but also in their relationship with the 
product, the brand and the sales person, way into the future. By taking the long 
view, the great sales person works to develop intense loyalty that extends 
through the 
lifetime value of the customer.</p>
<p>The good sales person knows that buyers may need to persuade other people in 
their organization and provides support for this. The great sales person knows 
that they are selling to a complex system and proactively manages it as a whole. 
Early in the sales process they seek to understand the customer&#8217;s culture and 
operation and so address the human system as well as the formal structures. </p>
