<p>Abusive adult relationships are surprisingly common, where one partner acts 
in a way that causes distress to the other. </p>
<h2><a name="for"></a>Forms of abuse</h2>
<p>Relationships can become abusive where one person psychologically and/or 
physically abuses the other.</p>
<h3>Physical abuse </h3>
<p>Physical abuse creates pain, harm and distress, and includes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Invading body space and standing over the other person in a threatening 
	manner.</li>
	<li>'Mock' physical abuse, such as raising hand as if to strike, 'just 
	missing' and sudden movements.</li>
	<li>'Accidentally' causing distress or harm by such as touching, pushing, 
	bumping and tripping.</li>
	<li>Aggressively and directly harming by such as punching, gripping, cutting 
	and burning.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Psychological abuse</h3>
<p>Psychological abuse causes such as fear, negative self-image, and feelings of 
helplessness, and includes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Criticizing actions and decisions.</li>
	<li>Telling them they are stupid and lack intelligence.</li>
	<li>Telling them they are unattractive.</li>
	<li>Calling them names, comparing them with people in low social positions.</li>
	<li>Criticizing them in front of others.</li>
</ul>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Weakened resistance</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">The abused person typically has their ability and desire to 
resist or even leave severely weakened by the methods such as: </p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p ALIGN="left">Nit-picking, criticizing them for every little thing.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p ALIGN="left">Exhausting demands that require long hours of work.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p ALIGN="left">Waking them up from deep sleep.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p ALIGN="left">Criticizing the person's character, indicating they are 
	wholly incompetent.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p ALIGN="left">Guilt trips, blaming them for things which go wrong.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p ALIGN="left">Random acts of violence that leave the abused person 
	constantly in uncertainty and fear.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p ALIGN="left">Occasional acts of kindness that prove they are 'not all 
	bad'.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p ALIGN="left">Threatening to throw them (and the children) out on the 
	streets.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p ALIGN="left">Repeatedly dragging up 'things done wrong' in the past.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p ALIGN="left">Saying that if the abuser leaves the person will be devastated, 
	lose their job or otherwise harmed.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p ALIGN="left">Threatening extreme acts if the abused leaves (and blaming 
	them for it), such as 'suing for everything', killing the abuser or 
	committing suicide themselves.</p></li>
</ul>
<p ALIGN="left">The weakened person hence falls into a position of learned 
helplessness where they see no hope of change and no opportunity to leave.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Control</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">Abuse is often about control. The abuser may hence act in many 
different way to exert control at every level, such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p ALIGN="left">Dictating what the other person wears.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p ALIGN="left">Deciding who they can be friends with.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p ALIGN="left">Selecting or stopping hobbies and other activities.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p ALIGN="left">Expecting them to do all work around the home.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p ALIGN="left">Choosing when and what they will do together.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p ALIGN="left">Randomly checking up on the other person ensure they are 
	complying with demands.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p ALIGN="left">Interrupting and dragging them out of their social 
	engagements.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p ALIGN="left">Expect to be considered first in all decisions.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p ALIGN="left">Taking charge of all money and spending.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p ALIGN="left">Being strict time-keepers.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p ALIGN="left">Punishing any deviance from strict obedience.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p ALIGN="left">Making the person wait whilst the abuser carries on a 
	separate life.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p ALIGN="left">Isolating the person, separating them from any social 
	support.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p ALIGN="left">Demanding and forcing sexual acts.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Progressive abuse</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">The abuser may well start with minor abuse, such as expecting 
the other person to do something and being a bit upset if it is not done. When 
the other person complies, the abuser moves to a gradually higher level of 
abuse. Like the proverbial boiled frog, before long the abused person has 
accepted harsher and harsher treatment until what would once have been 
unacceptable abuse is now accepted as normal and even 'reasonable'.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Abusers may be attractive at first because of their strength and 
control. They act in a highly protective way and are seen to defend the other 
person. This can become unacceptable in their jealous guarding of the person 
they come to see as their 'property'. This leads to severing of relationships 
with pretty much everyone and so isolates the abused person further, giving them 
no social support and depressing them further into accepting the abusive 
situation without question.</p>
<h2><a name="per"></a>The abused person</h2>
<p>The abused person may be recognized by some of the characteristics below. It 
can be difficult to detect that a person is being abused when they may well be ashamed 
of the situation or be trying to protect the abuser.</p>
<h3>Psychological effects</h3>
<p>The abused person easily ends up in a negative mental state, where the 
following conditions may apply:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Feeling bad, useless and incompetent.</li>
	<li>Dependent on the abuser.</li>
	<li>Strangely still attracted to the abuser.</li>
	<li>Blaming themself for the situation.</li>
	<li>Feeling lonely and hopeless.</li>
	<li>Believing they cannot be helped.</li>
	<li>Believing others will not believe them.</li>
	<li>Believing others will interfere and only make things worse.</li>
</ul>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Hidden resistance</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">If the abused person summons up courage to resist, it is done 
very subversively such that the abuser cannot discover what they are doing. For 
example they may create a secret cache of their own food or make social contact 
with others when they are supposed to be shopping.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Coping</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">The abused person will try to mentally
<a href="../../../explanations/behaviors/coping/coping.htm">cope</a> with the 
situation, for example by
<a href="../../../explanations/behaviors/coping/denial.htm">denying</a> that 
there is any problem. </p>
<p ALIGN="left">They may deny the problem to themselves as they want to feel 
normal and may well blame themselves for the situation. </p>
<p ALIGN="left">They may well deny to other people who the person fears may look 
down on them for what is happening or who may try to fix the situation yet only 
make it worse. </p>
<p ALIGN="left">If the person gains some strange comfort from the situation, 
they may not want or seek help, perhaps being 'happy' to wallow in self-pity.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Most often, the person copes by just going along with the 
situation and 'not rocking the boat' for fear of punishment. They hence take the 
path of seeking least harm, particularly in the short term.</p>
<h2><a name="abu"></a>The abuser</h2>
<p>The abusing person may have particular characteristics, such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Believing they are always right (and others are wrong).</li>
	<li>Fearing loss of control, feeling good when achieving control.</li>
	<li>Feeling powerful when angry.</li>
	<li>Having an explosive, hair-trigger temper, easily flipping from nice to 
	nasty.</li>
	<li>Constantly concerned about being abandoned.</li>
	<li>Is very good at deception. Including deceiving themself.</li>
	<li>Enjoying manipulating others, by charm, persuasion or aggression.</li>
	<li>Seeing their partner as a possession more than a person.</li>
	<li>Being jealous, fearing others will steal their partner.</li>
	<li>Have different standards for themselves, for example enjoying other 
	relationships.</li>
</ul>
<p>The abuser may also have a past where they have been a failure in some way or 
have been abused themselves.</p>
<h3>Charming men</h3>

<p ALIGN="left">Abuse in relationships is most often, but not exclusively, men 
abusing women. This is due both to the male's physical strength advantage as 
well as evolutionary forces which tend to make men more aggressive.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Horley (2002) describes the 'Charm Syndrome Man', who starts off 
in a very charming and charismatic manner,
<a href="../../../principles/bonding.htm">bonding</a> the woman to him, then 
becomes gradually more controlling and abusive. This bonding, with occasional 
reinforcement by further bouts of charm, can lead the abused person to continue 
to love the abuser. The 
<a href="../../../explanations/theories/stockholm_syndrome.htm">Stockholm 
Syndrome</a> may also have a part in sustaining 
this connection.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">It can be difficult for others to accept that charming men are 
abusive in private. These abusers come from all walks of life and are not the low-class 
drunkards that are often associated with abuse.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Dominant women</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">Not all abusers are men. The archetypal dominant wife who exerts 
close control over the 'little man' does exist. Such women can be highly 
abusive, although seldom in a physical way. Yet with
<a href="../../../explanations/personality/disorders/histrionic_personality.htm">
histrionics</a> and constant nagging, the man is psychologically worn down and 
goes in constant fear of his partner ever opening her mouth.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Female dominance and abuse can also appear in other forms. Where 
they have power and where they seek a high level of control, they may use all 
means at their disposal to achieve their selfish ends. This may even include 
physical abuse if the man is so cowed or physically inferior as not to respond 
in kind.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Two methods that abusive women use are denial and departure, 
both of which act on the fear of loss. They threaten or actually take things 
away, such as meals, money, sex, children or themselves. They may also take away 
approval, dignity and reputation.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">The woman may also threaten to tell others what a bad person the 
man is (most people will more easily believe that the man, rather than the 
woman, is the abuser).</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Children often are a powerful lever as most men know that 
divorce settlements are more likely to award custody to the woman. </p>

<h2><a name="why"></a>Why it happens</h2>
<p>There can be a number of reasons why abusive relationships happen.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="left">Control</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">The most likely key reason that the abuser acts as they do is for the 
sense of <a href="../../../explanations/needs/control.htm">control</a> that it 
gives them. They act to control every aspect of the other person's life with the 
threat of abuse being used as coercion and to weaken resistance.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">The abuser needs to always be the boss, superior in every 
regard. In this position they can make demands and avoid all responsibility, 
blaming everything on the abused person. </p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">The dominant male</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">Although women can be abusive, the most common situation is of 
men abusing women. There is an
<a href="../../../explanations/evolution/evolution.htm">evolutionary</a> 
argument for this, that men are naturally aggressive and will seek to be 
dominant. In particular an 'alpha male' has a strong tendency to seek a 
superior position of control.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Men who abuse women may want to dominate other men (which is how 
men can achieve status and attract mates) but have largely failed in this. As a 
result, they seek an easier target in physically weaker women.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Male abusers often have strong opinions about gender roles, with 
the woman as the subservient housewife and the man as the strong controller. 
This is supported by social norms that subtly tell them they are in charge. They 
may also have had early evidence with a controlling father, priest or teacher.</p>

<p ALIGN="left">Despite much progress in female emancipation in developed 
countries, the truth is that men still get paid more, get more of the top jobs 
and have greater control in families. Evolution, of course, has also shaped 
individual brains and whole cultures to believe they are dominant.</p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Abusive past</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">A common pattern is that people who were abused, or witnessed 
abuse, become abusers. One reason for this is a perception that there are only 
two roles: abuser or abused. This is the same reason that people become bullies, 
in school, work and other contexts. </p>
<p ALIGN="left">In abusing their partner, there can be a twisted logic where 
they are indirectly taking revenge on their historical abusers. </p>
<h3 ALIGN="left">Victim mentality</h3>
<p ALIGN="left">While it is a trap for the abused person to think it is all 
their fault, they may subconsciously be encouraging the situation. Thinking of 
oneself as a victim means absolution from responsibility from any action to 
resolve the situation. It makes the other person wholly to blame and justifies 
feelings of hopelessness. Such thinking only serves to make the situation 
continue without resolution.</p>
<h2><a name="wha"></a>What to do</h2>
<p>What to do about an abusive relationship depends on who you are and what 
forms the abuse is taking. </p>
<p>Please note the notes here are generalized. In most circumstances, getting 
professional support is good idea. There are many groups and bodies whose 
primary purpose is to help you.</p>
<h3>Abused person</h3>
<p>If you are abused person, you need to get a perspective on the situation. If 
you clearly recognize what is happening from the above notes, then you are 
likely being abused. If you are not sure (and perhaps anyway) then get 
professional advice. </p>
<p>A trap is to believe that it is all your fault. This is what the abuser 
likely wants you to believe. The first thing you have to start doing is to change 
your thinking.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to try to stop the person, who is likely quite skilled at 
what they are doing. Telling them what they are doing and how you feel <i>may
</i>make them realize that it is bad and stop doing it. But it is more 
likely that they will simply increase the level of abuse in order to try to push 
you back into the subservient role.</p>
<p>A more practical solution, at least for a while, may be to get away. If you 
can stay with friends or family, this will give you respite and help you escape from the distorted thinking that the situation has forced upon you.</p>
<p>At some point, you will have to tell other people about what is going on. 
This can be scary as you may fear the shame or the consequences if your partner 
finds out. This is one reason why it can be helpful to talk to a professional. 
Family and friends can sometimes try to help but end up making things worse.</p>
<p>Trust is a critical question for you. You have likely had the trust knocked 
out of you, so you have to decide who you can really trust. While family and 
friends can be problematic, it can still be very helpful to find someone who 
will listen without over-reacting and who will work with you to resolve the 
situation.</p>
<h3>Family and friends</h3>
<p>If you are a friend or family member of the abused person, your natural 
reaction may be to wade in and confront the abuser. This may be effective, but 
it can also make things far worse so you do need to take care.</p>
<p>The best thing you can do short-term is to just listen to the person, take 
them seriously and let them stay with you if that seems best. If the situation 
seems hazardous, particularly with any significant physical abuse, then you may 
decide to call in the professionals, including the police.</p>
<h3>Abuser</h3>
<p>If you are abusing another person and want to stop, yet find it difficult to 
do this, there are things you can do. </p>
<p>There is help out there for abusers as well as abused people, although it may 
be more difficult to find. If you can, get support. It may difficult for you to 
talk about what you have done as, even if you have blamed the other person, 
inside you know that you are are the guilty party. The shame of this and perhaps 
the fear of punishment can prevent any action. </p>
<p>If you do care in some way for the other person, then you can perhaps talk 
with them (although do understand they may well not trust you). Getting 
professional help can be a good idea here, for example where a counselor can 
help you restart a healthy discussion.</p>
<p>Thinking about the collateral damage can help motivate you. Consider the 
children and the effects on them of what they may have seen or heard. Also 
remember that you may be found out or the abused person may turn on you. </p>
<p>If you 
find it difficult to stop yourself, you may even decide to move away or 
encourage your partner to move.</p>
