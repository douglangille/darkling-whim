<h1>Them and Us</h1>

</p>

<p class="smaller">&nbsp;</p>

      <p>There is a force in many organizations, both private and public, that 
		divides people into 'them and us' and so creates the seeds of 
		organizational failure. This force also acts on governments and nations 
		and underlies many historical revolutions.</p>
<h2><a name="ver"></a>Vertical division: Silos and Empires </h2>
<p>A common complaint in companies is that people in different departments not 
only have little understanding of one another but that they have a tendency to 
engage in inter-departmental battles. The immediate effect of this is that overall 
performance drops as people replace real, value-adding work with attacking 
others and defending their own territory. This can be seen in endless meetings, 
where many person-hours are lost in fruitless debate, and 'not my problem' 
attitudes of non-collaboration. </p>
<p>A common cause of inter-group strife is that processes operate horizontally, 
flowing across departmental boundaries, while power enacts vertically, down the 
hierarchical management structure. When people are supposed to collaborate with 
others at the same level elsewhere, their eyes are mostly turned upwards as they 
prioritize their actions to first please the whim of their managers. Support 
functions such as HR and IT can also acquire lives of their own and become more 
of a hindrance than a help. </p>
<p>Another cause of vertical division is the battle for resource. There is 
always too little money and too few people with required skills. As a result, 
managers and individuals often have to fight for the resource to do their jobs. 
Seduced by <a href="../../../explanations/power/power.htm">power</a>, some managers also seek to build their own little empires, 
gaining control over as many people and associated resources as possible. They 
then sit as lords and fight wars with other managers in attack or defending 
their territory.</p>
<h2><a name="hor"></a>Horizontal division: Managers and Workers </h2>
<p>Another division and perhaps the most common is between manager and 'worker', 
a name that betrays the mentality if not the practice. European history has laid 
a broad Western <a href="../../../explanations/culture/culture.htm">cultural</a> foundation in the principle of a land-owning 
aristocracy and a peasantry who were little more than servants. In many other 
countries there 
has been a common principle of a class system that keeps people in their place with 
hierarchical controls. A status-oriented culture points to this division to 
be of evolutionary benefit. After all, if you are the boss you can more easily 
spread your seed and protect your family. Even
<a href="../../../explanations/evolution/natural_selection.htm">natural 
selection</a> is a system of 
inequality. </p>
<p>Even the industrial revolution did little to help as the business owners 
became the nouveau riche and acted like lords while their managers directed 
impoverished workers. The defensive rise of Trade Unions only served to polarize 
the division further rather than build the equality they seek. </p>
<p>Even today, it is common to find differences between management culture and 
employee culture, with <a href="../../../principles/assumption.htm">assumptions</a> such as that only managers 
care about profits, they are more intelligent, and deserve to be paid more. </p>
<p>As with any deeply embedded system, language and actions often subconsciously 
reinforce the attitude. While executive washrooms are largely a thing of the 
past, managers tend to use more business jargon, act more assumptively and use 
their higher pay to live more affluently (which shows up in their dress and 
conversation). Even with collaborative notions such as empowerment, there is a 
subtext of the empowerers who graciously allow (yet still oversee) the empowered, 
again reinforcing the difference. </p>
<h2><a name="con"></a>Concentric division: Employees and Outsiders </h2>
<p>A third division is between insiders and outsiders. This force of corporate identification can be very helpful in creating a 
cohesive human branding if it can be given priority over vertical or horizontal 
division, although the immediacy of the multi-directional forces may only serve to complexify the chaos of difference. A greater risk is where it results in 
separation of employees from outsiders with whom they should have strong 
alignment. </p>
<p>The most important outsiders are customers. In the modern world of 
competition and choice, they have high expectations and their loyalty cannot be 
assumed. Yet tales of bad service and casual treatment abound. Customer phone 
connections get outsourced overseas, 'press 1 for sales' tone trees and 'please 
hold, your business is important to us' recordings abound.</p>
<p>Worse, talk and attitudes about customers can be unenthusiastic and even 
downright hostile. Their high expectations can make customers a nuisance and 
their lack of product knowledge can make them scornfully stupid. They are hard 
work, but most of all they are not us, which makes it easy to depersonalize them 
and hence think of them dispassionately. </p>
<p>Suppliers may get a somewhat worse deal than customers, as when the company 
is the customer they can be extremely demanding. Suppliers are easily suspected 
of over-charging and abusing the good will of the company. Rather more than 
customers they may be looked down on even as demands on them are escalated. 
There are costs of distrust, including various check-ups and repeating quality 
checks that the supplier should have already done. </p>
<p>Others with whom we should agree and collaborate can easily appear as 
oppressors who may be complained about or ignored. Investor demands for profit and 
growth can make them seem like slave-drivers or leeches, callously bleeding the 
company of its hard-earned income. Activists, politicians and those with social 
intent distract from this with demands to help society and the environment. 
Competitors, even, may seek collaboration on industry issues.<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="bas"></a>The underlying force </h2>
<p>The human species has a curious history. While we easily tend towards selfish 
personal gain, we are also tribal and will cling to those we know. We want both 
Me and We, having both separated
<a href="../../../explanations/needs/identity.htm">individuality</a> and joined
<a href="../../../explanations/needs/belonging.htm">belonging</a>. We need people to like, to be 
like and who like us, affirming and stroking our 
<a href="../../../explanations/needs/identity.htm">identity</a>. We also need 
different others who are not like us and who we can use to 
<a href="../../../principles/contrast.htm">contrastively</a> define 
our boundaries. They are not us, and because we want to be good, they must be 
contrastively bad. And bad people can be looked down on,
<a href="../../../explanations/behaviors/blame/blame.htm">blamed</a> and punished.</p>
<p>We do this both individually and collectively. We keep friends and colleagues 
close (though not so close they threaten our selves). Then to bound and bind the 
groups to which we belong, we identify outsider groups. In this way we create Us 
and Them. This defining separation is a trust boundary where I feel safe with Us 
and threatened by Them, and so seek to stay inside and keep outsiders out. The 
separation and boundaries are further sustained with ongoing ritual phrases and 
actions to boost the superiority of Us and downplay the importance of Them. </p>
<p>All this leads to effects such as
<a href="../../../explanations/theories/in-group_bias.htm">in-group bias</a>, 
where we like colleagues, and
<a href="../../../explanations/theories/out-group_homogeneity.htm">out-group 
homogeneity</a>, where we see others as
<a href="../../../explanations/theories/stereotypes.htm">stereotypically</a> 
alike, fall for the
<a href="../../../explanations/theories/ultimate_attribution_error.htm">ultimate 
attribution error</a> trap and
<a href="../../../explanations/theories/objectification.htm">objectify</a> them 
as non-human, so justifying inhuman attributions and treatment.</p>
<h2><a name="bre"></a>Breaking down the barriers </h2>
<p>The invisible barriers that separate 
<a href="../../../explanations/groups/groups.htm">groups</a> are high, but are not 
insurmountable. The classic conflict-management approach is to humanize the 
others, particularly by bringing people together. When we can see, meet and talk with them, we quickly find much in 
common. Our empathy kicks in and we connect with them. And the more of Them we 
meet, the harder it is to deny them their humanity. This does not always happen 
that easily. 
We fear deception while other forces such as the common need for shared 
resources can keep us apart. </p>
<p>Wicked problems are those for which there is no easy answer and their 
adaptive nature can turn solutions into a part of the problem. Although 
apparently straightforward, Us and Them can be surprisingly slippery. Even as 
you tear down the barriers between people, human nature will put them back up 
again. Turning Us and Them into just Us is hence a process, not a project. It 
takes constant conscious vigilance to deflect and overturn the unconscious human 
tendency to revert to hierarchical and tribal thinking.</p>
