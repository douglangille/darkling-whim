    <p>When we look out onto the world, we do not see it as it truly 
    is. All we see is the internal map we have created. Yet, as Korzybski 
    pointed out, the map is not the territory, even though we act as if were so. 
    We get trapped by our maps and by the mental models and beliefs that shape 
    them. Like the Corinthians, we see the world as through a glass, darkly.<h2>
    Tao clarity</h2>
    <p>The Tao provides a lens, or maybe a lens-cloth, to better see what is 
    there. Tao is neither a religion nor a system of dogma that forces itself 
    upon you. It offers neither salvation nor answers. More, it is a set of 
    gentle provocations that inspired the more intense Zen that it predates. 
    Heisenberg&#8217;s Uncertainty Principle says (and the Hawthorne experiments 
    proved) that the act of looking changes that which is being observed. By not 
    looking, Tao sees what is there.<h2>Tai Chi connection</h2>
    <p>Tai Chi Chuan is more than the strange floating exercises that Chinese do 
    in the early morning park. It is also the most effective martial art, 
    capable of killing at a touch and yet so soft it can be performed by an old 
    man or young woman. It includes moving other people so subtly they do not 
    realize they have moved. Tai Chi is all about Tao.<h2>Brand potential</h2>
    <p>Some brands have Tao in abundance. A. A. Milne&#8217;s enduring Winnie the Pooh 
    has lent its Tao to Disney. This is not surprising: being a brand the 
    touches the Tao already, Disney easily recognized Pooh&#8217;s potential. Virgin 
    is another Tao brand, where Richard Branson&#8217;s essential power spreads to all 
    corners of his empire.<p>Companies spend a great deal of time, money and effort in trying to create a 
    brand with an indefinable quality, but few succeed. Yet finding Tao is not a 
    matter of searching: it is more about opening eyes and seeing what is 
    already there.

    <p>Jeffery Pfeffer has complained about the knowing-doing gap, and there is 
    a gap beyond this: the doing-being gap. We fill our lives with doing and 
    think we have found success. Stopping the rush into action and just being is 
    seen as waste, yet Csikszentmihalyi&#8217;s experiments in &#8216;flow&#8217; have shown that 
    when we lose our sense of self, we paradoxically come back a happier person. 
    Jung, too, knew the importance of letting go when he said, &#8220;Learn all you 
    can about symbolism, then forget it all when you are analyzing a dream.&#8221; 
    Psychologists have rediscovered what has been known for centuries: the first 
    step is to let go and just be.</p>
    <h2>Tao is </h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="arial" style="line-height: 120%"><font face="Arial">The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao<br>
    The name that can be named is not the eternal name </font></p>
      <p align="right" class="smaller"><i>-- Tao Te Ching, by Lao Tsu
      </i> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The Tao is. It exists. It can be known, but it cannot be named. If you 
    grasp at it, like a shadow it is not there and all you feel is the pressure 
    of your own grasp. And yet it can be sensed. Like Alexander&#8217;s &#8216;Quality 
    without a Name&#8217;, it is always there but can never be adequately described.</p>
    <h2>Tai Chi centering </h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left" class="arial" style="line-height: 120%"><font face="Arial">When performing, you should be centered, balanced, stable and 
    comfortable.</font></p>
      <p align="right" class="smaller"><i><font face="Arial">-- </font>Treatise of Master Wu Yu-hsiang, in Tai Chi Classics, by Waysun Liao</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>What is noticeable about a Tai Chi master is the deep stillness that he 
    or she has. Before you start Tai Chi movements, you stop and still yourself. 
    In that moment of being, you become centred and whole. Centring creates 
    the structural integrity from which all effortless power flows. Throughout 
    all moving, the Tai Chi master remains centred.</p>
    <h2>Brand presence</h2>
    <p>Brands that know how to be, have presence. They can stand alone and 
    still, without clutter. They have an indefinable, yet instantly 
    recognizable, quality. You know them without having to try.</p>
    <p>Presence is naked essence. To find the essence of a brand, peel away words 
    and images and preconceptions until there is nothing left but the core. Let 
    it be. Know it, but do not try to name it: to do so would be a pointless 
    distraction. </p>
    <p>Google.com is a near-naked brand with clear presence. It has a minimal 
    interface yet a clear and friendly character that does what you need with 
    the minimum of fuss or intrusion.</p>
    <p>Generic brands have no presence, no essence. Their core is cheap and stolen 
    at best and hence vacant and not.</p>

    <p>We have five external senses with which to touch the world, though the 
    meaning we create is far from these. What we consciously sense is, as Weick 
    points out, an inner construction, within which we pay limited attention to 
    what is really there. Sensing for many, like being, is a forgotten skill. 
    What we think we see, hear and feel are numbed and distorted internal 
    interpretations.</p>
    <h2>Tao awareness</h2>
    <p>A fundamental principle of Tao is sensing what is real, of stripping away 
    all bias and preconception, of knowing ultimate truth.<br>
    <blockquote>
    <p class="arial" style="line-height: 120%"><font face="Arial">Attending fully and becoming supple,<br>
    Can you be as a newborn babe?<br>
    Washing and cleansing the primal vision,<br>
    Can you be without stain? </font></p>
    <p align="right" class="smaller"><i>-- Tao Te Ching, by Lao Tsu </i>   </blockquote>
    <p>Young children have not yet learned the layers of lies by which we insulate 
    and protect ourselves from the world. They see the Emperor&#8217;s new clothes in 
    all his vain glory. Each of us still has that child within, though it is too 
    often bound and gagged for fear of it disturbing our convenient 
    preconceptions. 
    <p> </p>
    <h2>Tai Chi sensing</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="arial" style="line-height: 120%"><font face="Arial">What do we mean by &#8216;energy&#8217; and how we are able to &#8216;listen&#8217; to it?<br>
    This must be carefully examined.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="right" class="smaller"><i>--
    Master Cheng&#8217;s Thirteen Chapters on Tai Chi Chuan, by Cheng Man-Ching</i></p>
    <p align="left">When the practitioner of Tai Chi touches another person, they feel far 
    beyond the texture of skin or clothes. Extending their sense into the heart 
    of the other person, they feel their structure, their balance, their intent. 
    They also sense how the other person and themselves are now intimately 
    connected into a single structure.</p>
    <h2>Brand sensitivity</h2>
    <p>A sensitive brand knows its targets. From the first contact through all 
    interactions, it extends deeply into their environment and touches people so 
    gently that the brand itself can feel every movement, every intent. </p>
    <p>A sensitive brand does not use crude annual metrics to drive aging 
    strategies. It senses constantly and in real-time so it can respond 
    realistically and effectively. Like a creeping vine, it extends fingers and 
    tendrils that touch, taste and test.</p>
    <p>Amazon.com have built remarkable sensitivity into their brand. They sense 
    who you are, what you look at, what you buy. Then give it all back to you to 
    help you find what you did not even know you needed.</p>
    <p>Generics sense brand leaders, rather than customers. Their skill is in 
    knowing what is profitable not what is. They blindly follow coat-tails and 
    hence are as vulnerable as their chosen leaders are insensitive.</p>

    <p>Extending senses and discovering your interconnectivity into the world is 
    a very illuminating act. Yet it is not enough. A moment&#8217;s touch, a burst of 
    enlightenment, does not provide all of the answers. To harmonize is to 
    extend sensing from the static into the dynamic. </p>
    <p>It means sensing not only where others are, but also where they are going, 
    and at what speed. It means following their present and future locus. To do 
    this requires being and becoming with them, as one.</p>
    <h2>Tao connection</h2>
      <p>In the Tao, everything is connected and hence part of one thing. Being 
    sensitive to that connection means being a natural part of the one. 
    <blockquote>
      <p style="line-height: 120%">
      <font face="Arial">A truly good man is not aware of his goodness,<br>
    And is therefore good.<br>
    A foolish man tries to be good,<br>
    And is therefore not good. </font></p>
      </p>
      <p> </p>
    <p align="right" class="smaller"><i>-- Tao Te Ching, by Lao Tsu
    </i> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">Connecting through the Tao is as natural as flowing water. If you think 
    about the act of harmonizing, then you are not harmonizing. Being and 
    sensing lead effortlessly to harmony, and in harmony is ultimate truth. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="arial" style="line-height: 120%"><font face="Arial">Knowing constancy is constancy.<br>
    Knowing constancy is enlightenment. </font></p>
    <p align="right" class="smaller"><i>-- Tao Te Ching, by Lao Tsu</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Tai Chi flow</h2>
    <p>There is a story of a master who was sitting when a sparrow alighted on 
    his finger, then could not take off again. Whenever the bird tried to push 
    off, the master&#8217;s hand moved down to completely neutralize the force. 
    Likewise in combat all attacks are sensed and followed so completely that 
    there is never an impact. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="arial" style="line-height: 120%"><font face="Arial">Even the mosquito finds no place to land on you without causing you to 
    move.</font></p>
    <p align="right" class="smaller"><i>-- Treatise of Master Wong Chung-yua, in Tai Chi Classics, 
    by Waysun Liao</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Brand harmony</h2>
    <p>A brand which is in harmony with people effortlessly follows and 
    anticipates their every move. Like a glove, it gently envelopes them, 
    connecting and becoming one with them. It also knows when the glove slips on 
    and slides off: brands do not live people&#8217;s lives, but they do help them in 
    their journeys.</p>
    <p>Toyota, in Japan at least, gets very close to its customers. They seem to 
    know when they are thinking of buying a new car. They even know when their 
    customers&#8217; children will start driving. They genuinely seek to become real 
    friends of the family.</p>
    <p>Generic brands may harmonize with the leaders they follow and hence find the 
    secondary vibrations of end customers. But sensitive leaders will feel this 
    attempted snagging and will as easily escape the generics as they follow 
    their real targets.</p>

    <p>Leadership is a perennial topic where its students seek the alchemist&#8217;s 
    stone that will transmute mere mortals into management gods. Yet few have 
    found the secret. </p>
    <p>Jim Collins found, in a study of 1435 top companies, only 11 companies which 
    had gone from being one of the crowd to sustained growth. Their secret was 
    always a quiet and humble leader who knew what he or she wanted and then 
    quietly shaped the greatness of their organization.</p>
    <p>A great leader loves his or her followers, unconditionally, who know this, 
    unquestioningly. When you know you are loved, how can you not trust fully?</p>
    <h2>Tao invisibility</h2>
    <p>In Tao, a leader is sage and invisible. With touch so light, sensitivity 
    so sharply honed, the leader seem to do nothing special, yet somehow they 
    achieve their goals. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="arial" style="line-height: 120%"><font face="Arial">The very highest is barely known by men,<br>

    <h2>Tai Chi spirals</h2>
    <p>Master Cheng said, &#8216;A force of a thousand pounds can be moved by a force 
    of four ounces.&#8217; This is not mysterious. A force travels in one dimension, 
    yet we live in three. Thus the defender always has twice the advantage of an 
    attacker. With gentle circles you can deflect attacks and slide around 
    defenses.</p>
    <p>Tai Chi also takes advantage of our very small focus of attention, creating 
    distractions whereby subtle attacks can gently slip through. Pickpockets and 
    magicians know this too. </p>

    <h2>Brand wisdom</h2>
    <p>A great brand is. It is in tune with its audience. It harmonizes and 
    leads so subtly, people say &#8216;We want it!&#8217; without the brand seeming to ask. 
    Like a wise sage or guiding star, the brand helps people see their real 
    destination.</p>
    <p>Southwest Airlines has &#8216;LUV&#8217; as its stockmarket ticker, and cares so much 
    for its customers they repeatedly flock to the charismatic and efficient 
    Southwest doors. Despite many attempts to emulate it, few have even got 
    close.</p>
    <p>Generics are not wise. They care only for profits and would even bleed dry 
    their golden geese. Yet sensitive leaders who know the Tao can lead the 
    generics as well as their customers. And like the pipers of old, they can 
    lead the merry dance right to the waters edge.<br>
