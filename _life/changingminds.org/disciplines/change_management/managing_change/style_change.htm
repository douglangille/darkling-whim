<p>Depending on the style and scope/size of the change, different approaches are 
likely to be taken. This is often a matter of management
<a href="../../../explanations/preferences/preferences.htm">preference</a>, 
although the <a href="../../leadership/styles/leadership_styles.htm">style</a> used 
should be more about the
<a href="../../leadership/styles/situational_leadership.htm">situational</a> 
factors.</p>

<h2><a name="the"></a>The collaboration spectrum</h2>

<p>There are several levels of collaboration that may be used along a spectrum 
that starts with full consideration of the people involved in the change and 
ends up with little or no concern for the people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Collaborative</h3>

<p>A collaborative approach to change means involving the people affected, 
creating the change <i>with </i>them rather than doing the change <i>to </i>
them. This works by creating <a href="../../../principles/pull.htm">pull</a> and 
gaining commitment through getting people to
<a href="../../../principles/investment.htm">invest</a> in the change.</p>

<p>A big dilemma with collaboration is the extent to which you allow people to 
make decisions vs. make recommendations about the change. Risks with giving away 
too much power include people making sub-optimal, self-oriented choices or the 
devolved decisions across the organization do not align with one another and 
hence create more problems than they solve.</p>

<p>A way of making collaboration successful is the <i>What-How </i>approach. In 
this method, the senior team still control the strategic decisions and work out
<i>what </i>needs doing. They then devolve <i>how </i>this is to be achieved to 
the organization below them -- in which more What-How deployments may occur.</p>

<p>The problem with collaboration is that it takes time and effort, which relatively few 
organizations are either willing or able to give. When speed is important and 
resources are thin on the ground, then investing in collaborative efforts can 
seem wasteful.</p>

<h3>Consultative</h3>

<p>A compromise to the full-on collaborative approach is to show that at least 
you are listening to the people affected by the change. This may take the form 
of interactive real-time 'town hall' meetings, directors' tours, and so on. It 
can use technology for web-enabled discussions and so on. It 
may also use suggestion schemes and the Request For Comment (RFC) approach, 
where plans out to people for comment, although what you do with comments 
received is entirely up to you. </p>

<p>Care must be taken during consultation to ensure that people know the 
process, and that they perceive it to be fair. As you move away from 
collaboration, greater trust is required of the decision-makers and thus more 
trust-building activities may be required.</p>

<p>Consultative approaches provide a degree of balance between the engagement of 
collaboration and the <a href="../../../principles/push.htm">push</a> of direction 
and coercion. </p>

<h3>Directive</h3>

<p>In a directive approach, there may still be a high level of communication, 
but it is now largely one-way. The organization is <i>told </i>how it will 
change. This is thus using the principle of <a href="../../../principles/push.htm">
push</a> to drive through change. With the control of what happens in relatively 
few hands, the risk of variation in the plan is essentially removed.</p>

<p>What will happen and when is laid out in a schedule that may or may not be 
publicized. The problem with this is that there is often a fear (which may or 
may not be well-founded) that there will be greater
<a href="../resistance_change/resistance_change.htm">resistance to change</a> if 
people know what is going to happen. Resistance comes particularly from those 
who hold power (and it is surprising what power even the most junior person can 
have). </p>

<p>To help reduce the problem of resistance, very high levels of communication 
may be required and a paternal-maternal approach may be used ('father knows 
best' + 'mother cares'). Thus, for example, there may be generous severance 
packages for those who lose their jobs.</p>

<h3>Coercive</h3>

<p>At the furthest extreme, a coercive approach pays little attention to the 
people, their ideas or their needs. Changes are implemented in a relatively 
mechanical way</p>

<p>Typical of a coercive approach is the <a href="../kubler_ross/shock_stage.htm">
shock</a> and surprise that people encounter as change is thrust upon them. A 
not unusual situation is that people arrive at work one Monday morning and find 
that they no longer have a job. They may alternatively be told that they are 
going to have to move far away across the country, a tactic sometimes used to 
legally reduce the workforce. Another variant is to bankrupt the company and 
then re-start as a new company with everyone having to apply again for their 
jobs (this has been used to get around Trade Union issues).</p>

<p>Not all coercive approaches are unethical and some are simply born of the 
need for urgency. Ethics lie in the values of the people who are planning and 
implementing the change, rather than the fact that a coercive approach is being 
used.</p>

<h2><a name="mat"></a>Matching style to situation</h2>

<p>The collaborative style used in any situation is often dictated more by the 
values and beliefs of the managers involved. A better approach is to consider 
various aspects of the situation before you choose the approach.</p>

<h3>Collaboration</h3>

<p>Collaborative approaches are particularly important when you have a high 
level of professionally qualified people whose brains may be usefully engaged in 
the planning process and who would be particularly dismayed at being left out. 
This becomes even more so if you are in an employment market where your people 
can easily leave to work in other companies.</p>

<p>Collaboration also may be the only approach when power is distributed across 
the company and you simply are unable to implement change without the full 
buy-in of large groups of people.</p>

<p>Collaborative approaches can require significant amounts of time and effort, 
and so may be restricted to situations where you have the foresight to change 
before it is thrust upon you.</p>

<h3>Consultation</h3>

<p>Consultation is, in many ways, a watered-down version of collaboration. The 
views of people are elicited, which does take some time, but any protracted 
period of debate is eliminated (achieving an acceptable decision with a lot of 
people is often very time-consuming).</p>

<p>Consultation thus works as a compromise and may be the only options when you 
have a lot of professionals and talent that can easily walk if they do not know 
what you are doing.</p>

<p>Electronic media can be very usefully used in consultation to engage a 
geographically dispersed organization, for example by using email or web-based 
responses.</p>

<h3>Direction</h3>

<p>Directive approaches flip over in approach from
<a href="../../../principles/pull.htm">pull</a> to
<a href="../../../principles/push.htm">push</a> and you thus need the power to be 
able to make this work, particularly getting people all going in the same 
direction rather than scattering as they run away from the push.</p>

<p>Direction thus needs to be done firmly and quickly and suits situations where 
time is of the essence. Strong planning is essential to make it work, as you 
seldom have time to go back and try something else. You also are leaving out the 
thoughts of a lot of other minds so you need to take time to get it right first 
time.</p>

<h3>Coercion</h3>

<p>Even more so than direction, coercive approaches suit only those situations 
where you need people to move particularly fast or where human relations have 
broken down to the point where nobody listens to anyone else and the only option 
is force. Of course this is not a desirable option, but when the alternative is 
total failure, it may be the best (or only) choice of action.</p>
