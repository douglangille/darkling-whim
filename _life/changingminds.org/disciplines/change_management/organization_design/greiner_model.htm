<p class="smaller" align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Greiner (1972, 1998) describes how companies go through a series of phases as 
they grow and develop. </p>

<h2><a name="cre"></a>Creativity</h2>
<p>When companies form and enter the <i>Creative Phase</i>, they are typically 
driven by the creative force of the founder and the new products and services 
that create value for customers. Innovation is natural and people do 
whatever is needed to make things work. </p>
<h3>Leadership crisis</h3>
<p>Initially, the founder (or the startup team) is able to cope with the demands of leadership, but as 
the company grows, they are pulled more and more in different directions until 
they are unable to fulfil their duties. </p>
<p>The increasing complexities of the firm may lead to challenges to the 
leader's ability, who may originally be the inventor and developer of the 
company products and who may find management and leadership a difficult 
challenge.</p>
<h2><a name="dir"></a>Direction</h2>
<p>The response to the leadership crisis is to get more professional in 
management, for example by hiring managers who have got more experience and 
education in the subject, typically at a larger firm.</p>
<p>Professional managers know more about planning and tactics and help out with 
strategic thinking and operation plans. Rather than rushing around doing what 
seems to be needed at the time, a longer-term view starts to emerge, giving 
direction and focus to proceedings. </p>
<p>This stage also includes separation of activities such as budgeting and 
marketing, although these are probably not yet done by a separate department.</p>
<h3>Autonomy crisis</h3>
<p>As professional managers start to direct the proceedings they typically have 
a greater interest in their own areas of interest than those of others or the 
overall firm. They seek personal success and will fight to achieve this. When 
they own all the resources they need, this is fine, but as the firm grows they 
fall into conflict with one another, arguing over resources and rewards.</p>
<p>The question hence arises of how to give managers and individuals the freedom 
to choose and succeed in a way that also helps the whole company.</p>
<h2><a name="del"></a>Delegation</h2>
<p>The response to the autonomy crisis is to divide and conquer with greater 
structure and deeper hierarchy, where individual departments and operational 
units have individual managers and are delegated greater autonomy.</p>
<p>This is the time when middle managers appear, running multiple 
operational units where they manage managers rather than give direct orders to 
the front line. </p>
<h3>Control crisis</h3>
<p>There are problems in delegation and in particular as it gets more complex in 
a growing firm, for example where the communicated 
requirements are not always understood, and where managers make autonomous 
decisions that, while they may make sense at their level are suboptimal for the 
overall organization. </p>
<p>Not knowing enough about what is really going on at the bottom of the 
organization, middle and senior managers at the end of this stage start to lose control over everyday 
operations.</p>
<h2><a name="coo"></a>Coordination</h2>
<p>The response to the loss of control is to put additional effort into 
reporting up and communicating in all directions. Isolated business teams and 
product organizations are joined up in business units and other collective 
organizations.</p>
<p>Finance is still managed centrally and becomes more sophisticated, looking at 
such as business unit return on investment. Reporting becomes more 
sophisticated with increasing demands on business units for information about 
all aspects of the business.</p>
<h3>Red tape crisis</h3>
<p>This coordination does not come at a price and the increasing reporting and 
control adds layers of bureaucracy at all levels. Layers in the company face 
off against one another and perhaps play cat and mouse games of reports that 
looks good and audits that seek hidden problems.</p>
<h2><a name="col"></a>Collaboration</h2>
<p>The growing antagonism of cold coordination is addressed by attention to 
human connection and more collaborative, supportive approaches. Bureaucracy is 
simplified and trust is rebuilt with a greater focus on common organizational goals.</p>
<p>Structures may be implemented to connect people in multiple dimensions, such 
as the use of matrix management. Reward systems may also be realigned to promote 
team and organizational success rather than just individual performance.</p>
<h3>Growth crisis</h3>
<p>While a collaborative organization is better in many ways than previous 
forms, there are now problems in how to grow further without overloading current 
systems and processes.</p>
<h2><a name="all"></a>Alliances</h2>
<p>The final stage is to address the crisis of internal growth by looking 
externally. One approach is to pursue growth through mergers and acquisitions. 
Another way is to create a virtual super-organization by forming partnerships 
and alliances where the business value created can benefit everyone. A typical 
way this happens is where each partner contributes particular skills and 
competences to a total customer solution. </p>
<p>No doubt there are crises beyond this phase, but Greiner's model does not 
discuss them. Typical problems include a repetition of earlier phases, but on a 
grander scale. For example where communication between partners is weak, leading 
to more formal coordination. Mergers and Acquisitions are also subject to failure, often because of cultural and personal differences.</p>
<h2><a name="dis"></a>Discussion</h2>
<p><a href="../../../explanations/learning/learning_stage_theory.htm">Stage 
models</a> have two ways of transitioning between stages. The change can 
be smooth or it can be punctuated by crisis and struggle. This is a crisis-based 
transition model. There is an implication in this where firms that do not 
successfully negotiate these crises will stagnate and possibly fail. The human 
development parallel is where a person becomes stuck and unable to fully develop 
to adulthood (this is the cause of many neuroses).</p>

<p>Within each phase, the organizational design is initially suitable for the 
company size and context. As growth continues, the design becomes unwieldy and 
the very factors that at first made it suitable now lead to a crisis that triggers the 
redesign and transition to the next phase. This pattern then repeats the cycle of initial 
appropriate design followed by increasing tensions as growth causes new 
problems.</p>
<p>This echoes a kind of <a href="../../storytelling/storytelling.htm">
storytelling</a> pattern, whereby realistic stories are not linear narratives 
but have twist and turns in the plot. There is also a yin-yang cycle, where 
the solution for one crisis holds the seeds for the next crisis. There is even a 
parallel in political systems which cycle between stability and revolution.</p>
<p>A clear with
<a href="../../../explanations/evolution/evolution.htm">evolution</a> can be 
identified whereby the 
business evolves as it grows, adapting to the internal and external forces that 
it finds. Along the way,
<a href="../../../explanations/evolution/natural_selection.htm">selection</a> 
takes place as those that do not adapt, fail.</p>
<p>The Greiner model is often shown as linear plot of time vs. business size, with jagged crises 
at regular points along the line. The duration and growth in size of each phase 
can in practice be highly variable and will depend both on the market and the 
ability of the organization to adapt and evolve.</p>
<p>Other studies suggest specific business dimensions that must be addressed 
during transition. </p>
