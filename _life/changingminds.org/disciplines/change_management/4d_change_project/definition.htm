<p class="smaller" align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Definition phase takes preparing for delivering the project from knowing 
what is wanted and having an outline of what will be delivered to a clear 
specification of what will be delivered such that a confident estimate can be 
made as the time, cost and quality of delivery.</p><h3>
Simple projects</h3><p>
For small and clear projects, Gate 1 and Gate 2 may be passed at the same time, 
as the deliverables can be specified early and in sufficient detail to make a 
clear commitment on quality, time and cost. For projects where a more detailed 
investigation is required before commitments can be made, the Definition phase 
provides extra time to enable this to happen.</p><h3>
Separate what and how</h3><p>
In Prince 2 terms, the documents delivered at Gate 2 collectively form the PID 
(Project Initiation Document). It is recommended here that this stage separate 
the &#8216;what&#8217; of the specification from the &#8216;how&#8217; of the plan. This is because the 
&#8216;what&#8217;, once agreed, changes slowly, whereas the &#8216;how&#8217; of the plan may vary more 
often.</p><h3>
Documents</h3><p>
Note that the documentation for Gate 2 may vary significantly, depending on the 
project, how large and complex it is, and consequently the communication and 
assurance needed. In smaller projects, the only documents that may be needed at 
this stage are an extended Project Brief and Timeline. Risk Registers and Issue 
Logs are commonly required. The most likely additional document is a 
Specification. A more detailed Project Plan and specification change control are 
more likely to be required in larger projects. Quality and Commitment plans 
detail plans in these areas.</p><h2>
&nbsp;</h2><p>
Activities in this stage include further investigation that allows a detailed 
specification of what will be delivered.</p><h2>
<a name="inv"></a>Investigation</h2><p>
Investigation in Definition typically continues initial investigations from 
Discovery into further detail. The goal in all cases is to identify what exactly 
needs to be done in future work and hence the effort required and the risk 
involved. </p><h3>
Technical investigation</h3><p>
Particularly when software is being written or used, this phase may include 
further technical exploration to determine the detail of what technical solution 
should be implemented. This may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Developing prototype software to explore concepts and assess performance 
potential.</li>
  <li>Building &#8216;wire frame&#8217; outlines to explore user interfaces.</li>
  <li>Identifying hardware requirements, including processing power and network 
throughput needs.</li>
  <li>Determining software and hardware support and maintenance needs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Process investigation</h3><p>
Where a process is to be changed, further investigations may be appropriate to 
understand the size of the task and the changes to be made. Activities might 
thus include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mapping the process in further detail to identify precisely what needs 
  changing.</li>
  <li>Identifying roles and responsibilities and how people are organized and work 
within the process.</li>
  <li>Understanding interfaces and interactions with other processes.</li>
  <li>Identifying timescales and costs, seeking potential efficiencies.</li>
  <li>Highlighting weak points and where errors and risks may occur, for example at 
decisions, handover points or where manual transcription of data occurs.</li>
  <li>Understanding variation and statistical performance (for example across 
delivery timescales).</li>
  <li>Understanding systemic effects, for example where an event in one part of the 
process leads to problems several months later elsewhere.</li>
  <li>Measurement of performance to determine areas of greatest need for 
improvement.</li>
  <li>Determining which changes would return the greatest value.</li>
  <li>Investigating the impact of changes on various stakeholders, including the 
risks of resistance to the changes.</li>
  <li>Outlining alternative designs and exploring the costs and benefits of each. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>
Social investigation</h3><p>
The project may have significant effects on a range of 
<a href="../stakeholder_change/stakeholder_change.htm">stakeholders</a>, who in turn 
may have a significant effect on the project. This clearly needs managing and 
the social investigation may thus:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Review stakeholders with regard to who needs to input to the project and who 
else is impacted by it. This may include RACI (those responsible, those 
accountable, those who should be consulted and those who should be informed 
about the project).</li>
  <li>Understand the landscape of support and opposition to the overall project and 
reasons for this. This may include a power analysis to assess potential impact 
on the project.</li>
  <li>Present results of technical and process investigations to gain input and 
understand commitment to potential solutions.</li>
  <li>Determine the detail of commitment management that will be required and hence 
the detail of commitment plans.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name="spe"></a>Specification</h2><p>
Specification details the &#8216;what&#8217; of the deliverables to be created and deployed 
in the project and is typically in a separate document. If contractors are being 
used, this will form a core part of the contract with them. The deliverable may 
include a wide range of items, including software systems, process changes, 
training courses, service changes and so on.</p><p>
Note that if incremental development is being used, the specification may 
initially be incomplete and expanded with each evolution.</p><h3>
Outline design</h3><p>
The Outline Design describes the overall architecture of the solution, for 
example showing how databases and networks will be used, the overall content of 
training sessions, etc. It provides the &#8216;big picture&#8217; which is useful for 
discussion, communication and agreement. For this purpose it typically makes 
good use of diagrams and charts. It also has the major purpose of being the 
basis on which more detailed design is completed. The outline design may thus 
include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Diagrams that show the major building-blocks of the solution.</li>
  <li>Pictures of the user interface and otherwise descriptions of how the end-user 
experiences the solution.</li>
  <li>Database schema and other information organization structures.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Functional specification</h3><p>
The Functional Specification details exactly how the deliverable operates. It 
describes the product or solution in full detail, explaining how it functions, 
both from the user&#8217;s viewpoint and with regard to its inner workings. It may 
thus include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sections and sub-sections that break down functions in a logical order.</li>
  <li>Diagrams and tables that describe items in logical detail.</li>
  <li>Other detail, such as use-cases, test requirements, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The functionality of the solution is the major &#8216;what&#8217; that is delivered and 
leads to the desired outcomes and benefits.</p><h3>
Quality criteria</h3><p>
The success or failure of development of the specified solution is described by 
a set of quality criteria which can be used later to assess the delivered 
solution and hence determine whether or not it is acceptable. These criteria 
thus form a significant check at Gate 3, before the solution is deployed. The 
primary criteria are related to the delivery of outputs that lead to desired 
outcomes and benefits. Other criteria stem from these. An acronym for a common 
set of criteria that can be used is FLURPS, which stands for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Functionality: That the solution performs the functions described.</li>
  <li>Learnability: That the solution is easy to understand and adopt.</li>
  <li>Usability: That the solutions is easy to use on an ongoing basis.</li>
  <li>Reliability: That the solution does not fail.</li>
  <li>Performance: That the solution is responsive.</li>
  <li>Supported: That there is suitable support for the solution on an ongoing 
basis. </li>
</ul>
<p>It is important when defining quality criteria that they can feasibly be 
assessed. For example a criteria of &#8216;satisfying all users&#8217; does not say what 
&#8216;satisfying&#8217; means and assessment of &#8216;all&#8217; might be a very expensive task.</p>
<h3>
Test requirements</h3><p>
Solution development is a series of transformations from requirements to 
specification to design to final solution, including other interpretations along 
the way. At each transformation there is opportunity for error as some necessary 
things get left out, unwanted things get added and other things are 
misunderstood and distorted. Thus gaps form between what is intended and what 
gets specified, designed and created. Testing is the process of assessing these 
gaps and determining where transformation errors occur.</p><p>
Testing thus is a process that happens throughout design and development. Test 
requirements describe what is to be tested and may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Overall structure, formality and documentation of testing.</li>
  <li>Testing of specification against requirements.</li>
  <li>Testing of design against specification.</li>
  <li>Testing of the solution against requirements, specification and design.</li>
  <li>Testing of solution components during development.</li>
  <li>Involvement of stakeholders in testing. </li>
</ul>
<p>Testing is described in further detail in the section on Development.</p><h2>
<a name="doc"></a>Documents</h2><p>
Depending on the size of the project, Definition documentation may vary greatly. 
At minimum, this includes an update of the Project Brief and Project Timeline.</p>
<h3>
Project Brief update</h3><p>
The Project Brief, as originated in the Discovery phase is updated at this 
stage, to include any further detail or changes, for example to outputs 
required, timescales, approach and so on.</p><p>
For smaller projects, many of the items that would be in separate documents for 
a larger project may be included in this Brief. For a larger project, the 
separate documents may be referenced from the belief.</p><h3>
Specification</h3><p>
The Specification describes in detail that which will be delivered. </p><p>
The Specification may form the basis of a contract with an external supplier or 
consultancy who will be engaged to develop and/or deliver it. It also is used in 
quality assurance to verify that which is built is that which was required and 
agreed. Where outsourcing and contracts are being used, then sufficient time 
needs to be included in the project plan for negotiations, tendering and so on.
</p><p>
In a software development project, for example, the specification could include 
screen layouts, database schema and algorithms. In training design, it will 
include the overall methods of training and module contents.</p><p>
The Specification may also include aspects of delivery, such as maintenance. 
&#8216;Wire-frame&#8217; mock-ups may also be used within specifications, for example where 
the HTML for web pages is developed but without any back-end systems (thus you 
can click on links but nothing as yet happens).</p><p>
For smaller projects, the Specification may be included in the revised Project 
Brief.</p><h3>
Project Plan</h3><p>
The Project Plan details the approach being used in the Development and Delivery 
phases of the project. This may include details of key project decisions, 
resources, assumptions made, agreements and collaborations and so on. It also 
should include consideration of project governance, particularly when it varies 
from the standard Vanguard governance, including meetings, reporting and 
metrics. Where the projects uses other documents, such as project meeting 
minutes, then the templates and process for these may be included. Required 
conformance to any set of other standards may be noted, such as organisational 
reporting and documentation standards. </p><p>
For smaller projects, this detail may be included in the revised Project Brief.</p>
<h3>
Quality Plan</h3><p>
The Quality Plan describes the methods and timescales for assuring quality 
across the project, including testing of deliverables and incorporation of 
feedback and learning into what is being done. </p><p>
Quality has been defined as &#8216;fitness for purpose&#8217; and &#8216;conforming to 
requirements&#8217;. The ultimate test of quality is customer satisfaction and 
delight. Assurance of that beforehand typically means testing of products and 
processes against specifications (and specifications before that against 
requirements). Depending on the project, user acceptance testing (UAT) may be 
used as a part of the handover process into &#8216;business as usual&#8217;. </p><p>
Quality assurance is a form of risk management, acting to identify and prevent 
risks of non-conformance occurring. It typically includes assessment of 
potential and actual gaps between what is wanted and what is delivered, and 
acting to address these. Testing checks one thing (often a &#8216;product&#8217;) against a 
specification of some kind, identifying non-conformance. Quality assurance 
includes planning, recording and management of testing. Quality assurance work 
also starts early in the project, for example testing the Specification against 
Requirements.</p><p>
For medium-sized projects, the Quality Plan may be included in the Project Plan.</p>
<h3>
Commitment Plan</h3><p>
In many change projects the most difficult part of the process is in the 
Delivery phase, where the outputs are deployed to a wider group of people, some 
of whom may be unwilling to participate in this activity, either because they do 
not want to participate or because operational activities are taking priority.</p><p>
It is common in change projects to include communications, and these may well 
form an important part of the Commitment Plan. It is easy to communicate when 
this simply means telling people about what is happening. The problem is that 
what is often required is a commitment to specific action. The Commitment Plan 
thus needs to include activities that will persuade people to participate in and 
support the deployed change.</p><p>
An important part of commitment management is in the availability of an 
escalation process, should people not be participating as required. Typically 
this requires the support of a senior manager who will change priorities and 
mandate collaboration for those who would otherwise not participate.</p><p>
For medium-sized projects, the Commitment Plan may be included in the Project 
Plan. For smaller projects, this may be included in the updated Project Brief.</p>
<h3>
Timeline update</h3><p>
The detail of who does what and when should be produced as a separate item that 
can be constantly updated to reflect reality and the latest forecasts. This plan 
is then used to track project progress and manage issues such as slippages. 
Whilst a separate overall plan document may change little, the timeline will 
usually change frequently.</p><p>
For smaller projects, where interdependencies are not complex and where there 
are a limited number of tasks in the plan, this can be adequately done using a 
spreadsheet. For larger projects, where there are such complexities as multiple 
people, inter-dependent tasks and the need to calculate the critical path, then 
MSProject may be more useful.</p><h3>
Governance documents</h3><p>
Depending on the formality of the project, there may be more or less documents 
that record and communicate other governance activities. As appropriate, these 
should be managed and stored.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Contracts, SLAs and other formal agreements with suppliers and consultants.</li>
  <li>Meeting minutes, including actions and decisions.</li>
  <li>Risk Register and Issue Log that handle unexpected and undesirable activities.</li>
  <li>Change requests and responses, particularly when this involved contracted 
work.</li>
  <li>Presentations and communications about the project. </li>
</ul>
