<h1>Rationale for Resistance</h1>

<p class="smaller" align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="../../disciplines.htm">Disciplines</a> &gt; 
<a href="../change_management.htm">Change Management</a> &gt; 
<a href="resistance_change.htm">Resistance to change</a> &gt; Rationale for Resistance</p>

<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="#iwa">I want to stay</a> |
<a href="#ido">I do not want to change</a> | <a href="#iam">I am not going to 
change</a> | <a href="#see">See also</a></p>

<p class="smaller" align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rationale for resistance is often quite straightforward as people justify 
their actions to themselves. If you want to overcome resistance to change, you 
must be able to answer the following points.</p>

<h2><a name="iwa"></a>I want to stay where I am because&#8230;</h2>

<p>Even if you offer me a bowl of cherries, I may not be very concerned to take 
what you proffer if I am happy where I am now. People who have been in the same 
place for a long time are usually in this state. They do not need to change and 
will view any suggestion of change with distaste.</p>

<h3>&#8230;my needs are already met here</h3>

<p><a href="../../../explanations/needs/needs.htm">Needs</a> are basic drivers of 
action. If needs are not perceived as being particularly threatened and the 
current situation is relatively comfortable (particularly in comparison with the 
proposed change) then I will be happier to stay where I am.</p>

<p>If people already have their needs met, then you will need to shake the 
carpet and provide some sort of threat to those needs so they are no longer 
sufficiently met for the person to want to stay where they are.</p>

<h3>&#8230;I have invested heavily here</h3>

<p>When I have <a href="../../../principles/investment.htm">invested</a> a lot of 
time and energy in building up my position, both socially and organizationally, 
then any change may mean bad news. Social investment creates a person's sense of
<a href="../../../explanations/needs/identity.htm">identity</a>. Organizational 
investment gives them <a href="../../../explanations/needs/control.htm">control</a>. 
Sliding down the ladder that I have so painstakingly climbed over the year is a 
long way from my shopping list.</p>

<p>Where people have invested heavily, you will either have to show them how to 
get to a similar position in the new organization or otherwise reduce the value 
of their investment (for example by moving the people over whom they have social 
influence).</p>

<h3>...I am in the middle of something important</h3>

<p>When I have committed to achieving a
<a href="../../../explanations/motivation/goals.htm">goal</a>, either personal or 
emotional, then a part of my integrity and hence
<a href="../../../explanations/needs/identity.htm">identity</a> may be bound up in 
achieving the goal. When I have partly completed something, I am also affected 
by the need for <a href="../../../explanations/needs/completion.htm">completion</a>, 
such that I will feel uncomfortable with stopping now.</p>

<p>When people are busy, find ways for them to complete the work in the shorter 
term, perhaps by nudging their goals so they have less to do to complete. If 
possible, turn their work towards something that will be useful for the new 
organization.</p>

<h2><a name="ido"></a>I do not want to change because&#8230;</h2>

<p>Even if I am not that happy where I am, I still may not be particularly 
interested in moving forward with the change.</p>

<h3>&#8230;I do not understand what is being proposed</h3>

<p align="left">It is a common problem for those who are promoting change to 
assume that it is easy to understand. People who do not 'get' the rationale for 
change will be less likely to go along with it and may hence hang back whilst 
they try to figure out what it really means.</p>

<h3>&#8230;the destination looks worse than where I am now</h3>

<p>Although I want to move, the final resting place of the change looks 
significantly worse for me than the current position. I feel it is like jumping 
out of the frying pan and into the fire.</p>

<p>If you want people to voluntarily move, then it must be to somewhere better 
than they are now. You can create this in two ways: first by making the present 
position worse (though be careful with this!) and secondly by building a rosy 
vision to which people can then attach their dreams.</p>

<h3>&#8230;there is nothing to attract me forwards</h3>

<p>If the change is nothing to do with me, if the benefits are all for other 
people or the general organization, if I just do not buy the 'vision' as sold, 
then I will feel no <a href="../../../principles/pull.htm">pull</a> and I will not 
buy into the change.</p>

<p>You may offer forth a brilliant vision, but do the people buy it? Make sure 
your communications are clear and couched in terms that people can understand 
and buy into. Make your visions inclusive, such that people really can and will 
buy the change.</p>

<h3>&#8230;I do not know which way to move</h3>

<p>If I buy the vision, I may still may not know which way to jump. Some change 
projects sound wonderful, but people are left wondering what to do (even the 
managers). </p>

<p>Grand plans need to be turned into tactical detail in which people can see 
and easily take the step forward. </p>

<h3>&#8230;the journey there looks painful</h3>

<p>The final destination may be great, but the journey from here to there looks 
very uncomfortable. The anticipated pain of the transition is more immediate 
than the distant and hazy future, and I respond more to this than to any 
inspiring vision.</p>

<p>Make sure the transitional period between now and the final change does not 
appear so uncomfortable that people refuse to join you. In practice, it may not 
be that bad -- what counts, though, is the perception of the people, so design 
the transition well and then communicate it well.</p>

<h3>...the destination or journey is somehow bad or wrong</h3>

<p>If the transition or the final destination somehow transgresses my
<a href="../../../explanations/values/values.htm">values</a>, then I will judge it 
to be bad or wrong and will be very loathe to join the party.</p>

<p>Be careful with the change in working around established organizational and 
general social values. If you must break an unwritten rule (such as getting rid 
of people) then do so with appropriate consideration and care.</p>

<h3>&#8230;I do not trust those who are asking me to change</h3>

<p>If my experience of you is that you have been untrustworthy in the past, then 
I am not likely to buy your vision of the future. If you are going on what I 
perceive as a perilous journey, then I will not
<a href="../../../explanations/trust/trust.htm">trust</a> you and will not join 
you.</p>

<p>The integrity of <a href="../../leadership/leadership.htm">leaders</a> is a very 
important attribute. If you want people to
<a href="../../leadership/followership/followership.htm">follow</a> you, then you 
must give them good reason to trust you.</p>

<h2><a name="iam"></a>I am not going to change because&#8230;</h2>

<p>Even if people do not want to change, they may still have to do so, albeit 
truculently. Some people, how ever, have the wherewithal to refuse.</p>

<h3>&#8230;I am able to ignore the change</h3>

<p>One of the questions I will ask is 'What happens if I do not go along with 
the change?' If the negative implications for my non-compliance are negligible, 
then I can happily not join in. </p>

<p>This sort of situation occurs when the person in question is so valued by the 
organization that the idea of them leaving is unthinkable. This is often where 
difficult choices around change take place. What do you do with the laggards? If 
this problem is not addressed, then the people around them may take their lead 
and before long you have a silent revolution on your hands.</p>

<h3>&#8230;I have the power to obstruct the change</h3>

<p>Another reason why a person can happily ignore the change is because they can 
stop it. People in senior positions often treat change as being a good thing -- 
as long as it is for someone else. When faced with change themselves, they may 
do whatever it takes to scupper the change, for example by refusing to give 
needed access or other support.</p>

<p>This is a good test of the senior sponsor of change -- which may need to be 
the most senior officer in the organization. Those who actively oppose the 
change must be dealt with -- preferably kindly and in in an understanding way, 
but ultimately in a firm and final way. </p>
