<h1>Resume/CV Power Words</h1>

<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="../../disciplines.htm">Disciplines</a> &gt;
<a href="../job-finding.htm">Job-finding</a> &gt; <a href="resume.htm">Resume /

<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="#pro">Problems</a> | <a href="#act">
Actions</a> | <a href="#res">Results</a> | <a href="#ski">Skills</a> |
<a href="#per">Personal</a> | <a href="#tec">Technical</a> | <a href="#cav">

<p class="smaller" align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the various parts of your resume/CV it is helpful to use powerful words 
that convey how good you are at what you do.</p>

<h2><a name="pro"></a>Problems</h2>
<p>Problems need to be seen as significant challenges, not quick and easy things 
you can do in a few minutes. Such words indicate difficulty, risk and other 
attributes that make it a worthy problem:</p>
<p class="quote">awkward, cancel, challenge, difficult, dangerous, elusive, 
failure, illegal, impact, incomplete, issue, jeopardize, hard, hazardous, 
hidden, intractable, knotty, loss, non-conforming, non-compliant, problematic, 
risky, thorny, tough, tricky, troublesome, uncertain, wicked problem</p>
<h2><a name="act"></a>Actions</h2>
<p>Action words show what you do to solve the problem. </p>
<p>There is a huge range of
<a href="../../../techniques/language/speech_parts/verbs.htm">verbs</a> that can 
be used. Here is a relatively small sample:</p>
<p class="quote">accelerated, accomplished, achieved, acquired, adapted, 
addressed, adjusted, advanced, allocated, altered, analyzed, anticipated, 
applied, appraised, arbitrated, arranged, asked, assembled, assessed, augmented, 
automated, began, budgeted, briefed, brought, called, changed, clarified, 
classified, created, coached, collated, conducted, constructed, communicated, 
completed, compiled, consulted, consolidated, contracted, coordinated, 
cultivated, curtailed, cut, dealt, decided, decreased, delegated, delivered, 
demonstrated, derived, designed, detected, developed, devised, diagnosed, 
differentiated, directed, diversified, diverted, divested, doubled, earned, 
eliminated, endorsed, enforced, engineered, enlarged, ensured, engineered, 
enlisted, ensured, established, evaluated, executed, expedited, experienced, 
experimented, extended, finalized, fixed, focused, formed, formulated, fostered, 
found, founded, fulfilled, gained, gave, generated, governed, guided, halted, 
handled, headed, hired, honed, identified, implemented, improved, increased, 
influenced, initiated, innovated, inspired, installed, instituted, instructed, 
integrated, introduced, invented, investigated, isolated, issued, kept, 
launched, learned, led, listened, made, maintained, managed, marketed, mastered, 
maximized, mechanized, mediated, mentored, minimized, moderated, modified, 
motivated, navigated, negotiated, networked, nurtured, obtained, offered, 
operated, optimized, orchestrated, originated, outsourced, overcame, overhauled, 
oversaw, perfected, performed, persuaded, piloted, pinpointed, pioneered, 
planned, predicted, prepared, presented, prevented, prioritized, probed, 
procured, produced, projected, promoted, proposed, protected, proved, 
publicized, published, purchased, qualified, questioned, queried, raised, ran, 
ranked, rated, reached, received, reconciled, recommended, recruited, reduced, 
redesigned, re-engineered, refined, regulated, rehabilitated, reinvigorated, 
remodeled, renegotiated, reorganized, repaired, replaced, represented, 
requested, required, researched, resolved, restored, restructured, retrieved, 
reversed, revised, revitalized, risked, safeguarded, salvaged, saved, scheduled, 
secured, selected, set, settled, shaped shared, shortened, sold, solved, 
speeded, spearheaded, specified, stabilized, standardized, started, steered, 
stopped, streamlined, strengthened, stressed, structured, supervised, supported, 
surpassed, sustained, synergized, synthesized, systematized, targeted, taught, 
tightened, tracked, trained, transformed, treated, trimmed, tripled, uncovered, 
undertook, unified, upgraded, used, validated, verified, visited, volunteered, 
widened, won, wrote</p>
<p>From this, you can use verbs to show particular qualities with words such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Initiative</i>: called, created, devised, designed, developed, 
	formulated, founded, generated, initiated, set up, started</li>
	<li><i>Leadership</i>: coached, coordinated, delegated, directed, drove, 
	enabled, enforced, encouraged, established, guided, inspired, led, managed, 
	mentored, motivated, nurtured, orchestrated, organized, steered, supervised</li>
	<li><i>Organization</i>: arranged, collected, distributed, filed, inspected, 
	maintained, monitored, organized, planned, prepared, processed, recorded, 
	reviewed, scheduled, sorted, standardized, systematized, updated, verified 
	</li>
	<li><i>Communication</i>: addressed, broadcasted, called, collaborated, 
	contacted, corresponded, elicited, heard, influenced, listened, negotiated, 
	presented, settled, spoke, told</li>
	<li><i>Helping</i>: aided, assisted, cared, counseled, diagnosed, educated, 
	encouraged, facilitated, influenced, referred, rehabilitated, supported, 
	taught, volunteered</li>
	<li><i>Problem-solving</i>: analyzed, assessed, classified, created, 
	critiqued, designed, developed, evaluated, invented, isolated, mapped, 
	optimized, prioritized, revised, solved, tested</li>
	<li><i>Creativity</i>: built, composed, conceptualized, created, designed, 
	directed, drew, entertained, fashioned, illustrated, invented, innovated, 
	modeled, originated, painted, performed</li>
	<li><i>Improvement</i>: decreased, eliminated, enhanced, increased, 
	maximized, minimized, removed, sharpened, shortened, speeded, terminated</li>
</ul>
<p>Be careful with words that show you in some weak or non-positive way 
(although in an appropriate setting some of these can still be valid), such as:
</p>
<p class="quote">assisted, attempted, contributed, felt, helped, participated, 
supported, thought, tried, worked</p>
<p><a href="../../../techniques/language/speech_parts/adverb.htm">Adverbs</a> 
enhance the verbs, strengthening the meaning and adding additional dynamism and 
intensity. 
Typical adverbs include: </p>
<p class="quote">accurately, actively, assertively, carefully, completely, 
confidently, conscientiously, consistently, creatively, effectively, 
efficiently, entirely, exceptionally, extensively, extremely, highly, 
immediately, independently, intelligently, logically, massively, meticulously, 
patiently, practically, precisely, progressively, quickly, quietly, rapidly, 
realistically, reliably, responsibly, securely, significantly, steadily, 
strongly, substantially, tactfully, thoroughly, uniquely, vigorously, virtually</p>
<h2><a name="res"></a>Results</h2>
<p>Results words show that your actions have solve the problem, creating useful 
value and giving real benefits to the company and its customers.</p>
<p>Verbs tell you what you did in terms of achieving the result, as opposed to 
the action of getting there. </p>
<p class="quote">accomplished, achieved, agreement, attained, approved, awarded, 
completed, decreased, delivered, doubled, enlarged, eliminated, enhanced, 
established, exceeded, finished, fulfilled, halted, increased, instituted, 
isolated, optimized, reached, realized, reversed, passed, satisfied, shortened, 
standardized, succeeded, surpassed</p>
<p>Nouns show what has been gained:</p>
<p class="quote">approval, award, benefit, bonus, profit, revenue, satisfaction, 
value</p>
<p>Other nouns that show ability may be used include:</p>
<p class="quote">ability, accomplishment, accuracy, activity, assistance, 
balance, capability, capacity, career, change, communication, confidence, 
control, data, deal, decision, design, discretion, duty, education, energy, 
enterprise, evaluation, foresight, function, goal, improvement, income, 
initiative, instruction, invention, job, judgement, knowledge, leadership, 
management, operation, plan, product, program, project, promotion, 
qualification, record</p>
<p>Words to indicate meeting goals include:</p>
<p class="quote">accurate, complete,&nbsp; on time, on budget, on quality</p>
<h2><a name="ski"></a>Skills and experience</h2>
<p>Skills and experience often deal in
<a href="../../../techniques/language/speech_parts/nouns.htm">nouns</a>, the 
things you have done and which you can use to help a future employer. Nouns may 
be physical things, ideas or the results of action (in which case they appear as 
nominalized verbs).</p>
<p>Nouns to use can be very varied depending on the job, but here are a few for 
example:</p>
<p class="quote">acquisition, advice, assistant, book-keeping, campaign, 
communication, computer, conference, consumer, contract, cost, course, credit, 
customer, cycle, data, document, education, employee, engineering, entrance, 
environment, excellence, experience, facility, finance, goods, hardware, 
invention, loss, knowledge, labor, leader, management, meeting, operation, 
partner, people, plan, price, production, profit, program, project, quality, 
record, return, safety, satisfaction, schedule, stock, supplier, system, team, 
technology, time, transaction, user, work, workflow, visit, yield</p>
<p>Note that for scannable resume/CVs, nouns are often more important than 
verbs. The best way to find the most important nouns for you is to get a number 
job descriptions for the job type you are seeking and look for common nouns 
used.</p>
<p><a href="../../../techniques/language/speech_parts/adjective.htm">Adjectives</a> 
extend the meaning of nouns and may be used to increase and enhance information 
given. As with nouns, these may be very job-dependent. Some adjectives you may 
use include:</p>
<p class="quote">electronic, emergent, entry, foreign, global, joint, local, 
permanent, temporary</p>
<p>See also below for technical jargon, which also uses many nouns.</p>
<h2><a name="per"></a>Personal attributes</h2>

<p>Personal attributes describe you, your values, your attitude and approach to 
life. These often appear as adjectives. Here are some of the best to use:</p>
<p class="quote">active, adaptable, ambitious, assured, calm, caring, cheerful, 
considerate, conscientious, consistent, creative, credible, dependable, 
determined, diligent, diplomatic, discreet, dynamic, eager, efficient, 
energetic, enterprising, enthusiastic, excellent, flexible, focused, generous, 
happy, honest, independent, industrious, knowledgeable, level, loyal, mature, 
methodical, motivated, open, passionate, persistent, practical, productive, 
professional, punctual, quiet, realistic, receptive, respected, resolute, 
responsible, self-starter, sincere, steadfast, studious, tactful, team-player, 
thoughtful. tough, trustworthy, unbiased, vigorous, warm, willing</p>

<h2><a name="tec"></a>Technical jargon</h2>
<p>Whilst they are too specialized to list here, any words that describe the 
technologies and general jargon of what you do may be particularly important.</p>
<p>For example, a software engineer may list:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Programming languages</li>
	<li>Development systems</li>
	<li>Operating systems</li>
	<li>Databases</li>
	<li>Hardware</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="cav"></a>Caveat</h2>
<p>An important thing with power words is not to over-use them, and particularly 
not to over-use the same words. If everything you did is 'successful', the 
recruiter is likely to get tired of the word and either ignore it or discard 
your entire resume/CV.</p>
