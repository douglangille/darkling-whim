<p>Counseling has not had a long history in its current form, yet it has 
happened for centuries and longer.</p>

<h2><a name="fam"></a>Family and religion</h2>
<p>There has been a long need for counseling in helping individuals with 
transitions and other difficulties in their lives. The long tradition of 
counseling is first of family members helping with advice. Parents counsel their 
children. Grandparents and other family elders offer the wisdom of the years.
</p>
<p>In a close community, there may also be tribal elders or others with a 
concern for mental well-being. This role for many years was (and still is) taken 
on by the priest or religious person. For the individual, the priest offers 
confidentiality that enables discussion of family matters or things that are 
secret from the family. The priest meanwhile gets to steadily inculcate 
religious values, making it a valued relationship on both sides. The church 
tended to view mental illness as some form of possession and treatment, 
including exorcism, was of the soul rather than the body.</p>
<p>Those with more incurable issues were generally tolerated. The village idiot 
was found a place in the fields and others were cared for or handled within the 
community.</p>
<h2><a name="ind"></a>The industrial revolution</h2>
<p>With the age of the enlightenment and the rise of the industrial revolution 
through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, populations became mobile as 
they sought employment in towns and cities that were often far from their 
original homes. This separated them from their natural counselors, although the 
religious support was still available. Yet with the rise of science, the power 
of the church declined and it was not always able to give the help that was 
needed.</p>
<p>Capitalism and science also had subtle effects on beliefs, values and general 
cognition. Everything had to be explained. The work ethic was dominant and 
hedonism was an option for only a few. </p>
<p>Along with the concentration of towns and cities came the need to protect its 
citizens and civic organizations such as police forces were developed. In small 
communities the power of shame and the threat of banishment is enough to sustain 
social control. In town, anonymity is an option which brings its own problems. 
Particularly in America, social mobility was very much a norm.</p>
<p>As much to protect the populace as the individual concerned, somewhere 
between the workhouse, hospital and prison sat the lunatic asylum. Here, the 
insane (as well as a few unhappy individuals who had embarrassed their families) 
were incarcerated with little treatment. </p>
<p>Science scoffed at the notion of possession by demons but had little idea 
what to do beyond basic approaches such as drugging and leeching. In the cruel 
days of misfit sideshows, the asylum was just another place to go and laugh at 
those less fortunate.</p>
<h2><a name="psy"></a>The rise of psychotherapy</h2>
<p><a href="../../techniques/hypnosis/hypnotism.htm">Hypnotism</a> had been 
known about for some time (Mesmer lived around the turn of the eighteenth 
century), and was popular through the ninteenth century and was used as an 
informal therapeutic method. Nevertheless it 
perplexed scientists who were suspicious of its shamanistic roots.</p>
<p>With the continued development and dominance of scientific medicine, 
establishment attention was eventually turned to 
matters of the mind (something that
<a href="../../explanations/research/philosophies/empiricism.htm">empiricists</a> 
had largely ignored as impenetrable). Medical science took over as the 
caretakers of the mentally disturbed and a new age of and discipline of 
psychiatry arose towards the end of the nineteenth century. </p>
<p><a href="../psychoanalysis/theorists/freud.htm">Sigmund Freud</a> was perhaps 
the most significant pioneer in seeking to understand and treat mental problems, 
at least in those who lived in normal society but who suffered from emotional 
and behavioral difficulties. Rather than try to treat mental problems as a 
physical issue, he chose to listen to them and try to work out what was 
happening from what they said, and then apply treatment in the opposite 
direction, again through words.</p>
<p>Despite massive leaps, Freud was still trapped by notions of his day, such as 
the assumption that mental problems had an emotional basis and the derivation of 
ideas such as <a href="../psychoanalysis/concepts/life_death_drives.htm">libido</a> 
came from nineteenth century biological theories.</p>
<p><a href="../psychoanalysis/psychoanalysis.htm">Psychoanalysis</a> thus 
developed and was evolved by people such as
<a href="../psychoanalysis/theorists/lacan.htm">Jaques Lacan</a> and
<a href="../psychoanalysis/theorists/klein.htm">Melanie Klein</a> into the 
approaches still used today. This was not without some internal division of 
opinion and Klein famously split with Sigmund Freud's daughter, the more 
traditionalist Anna.</p>
<h2><a name="hum"></a>Behaviorism and humanism</h2>
<p>In the way that a thing creates its opposite, the assumptions of psychoanalysis 
were challenged in the scientific search for hard evidence, and
<a href="../../explanations/behaviors/conditioning/history_behaviorism.htm">
behaviorism</a> and
<a href="../../explanations/behaviors/conditioning/conditioning.htm">
conditioning</a> became popular for the focus on the external, measurable 
behavior.</p>
<p>In the opposite direction, and particularly in the more liberal America, a different 
view arose amongst people such as Carl Rogers, Albert Ellis, Eric Berne and 
Abraham Maslow. These put the person and their experience at the middle of 
attention, as opposed to the more therapist and method focus of psychoanalysis. 
This may seem unfair but the humanist approach is just that - human. It sees the 
client as a collaborative partner, not as a patient to be treated by an expert. 
Humanism, even more than Behaviorism and quite unlike Psychoanalysis, has a 
focus on the present rather than the past.</p>
<p>Humanism was largely a practitioner philosophy and was largely ignored by 
academe for a long time. Nevertheless its warm message resonated with both 
therapists and clients and it was widely used. Despite secular leanings, this 
approach was influenced by Protestant values such as free choice by the 
individual and the personal journey. </p>
<h2><a name="sec"></a>Secular society</h2>
<p>With the decline of the church as a social institution that exists at the 
heart of the community and the lives of its people, there arose a vacuum of 
meaning and care. Without the comfort of promised salvation, many lost their 
sense of purpose in the meaningless daily drudge. And without the sage and 
certain advice of the priest, the neuroses of industrial living worsened. </p>
<p>Cities can be lonely places. With family far away and fickle friends who 
enjoy the fun but step back when emotional support is needed, a person can be 
out and dancing yet feel terribly alone.</p>
<p>In such an environment there is a vacuum, a pent-up need for help towards the 
making of meaning for individual lives. It was this need, this pull, that 
created the new disciplines of therapy and counseling. It was the loss created 
by sundered societies that drove some to despair and other to consider what 
succor and treatment could be provided to create a more harmonious. Those who 
wanted just to do good and those who saw the social imperative worked to develop 
ways and means of putting people back together and back into society. In pursuit 
of happiness and the American Dream, self-development was a common focus. Even 
in the first world war, the US army employed psychologists and psychological 
testing was widespread. </p>
<h2><a name="twe"></a>Twentieth century expansion</h2>
<p>Psychotherapy first caught on in a significant way in the USA, helped by a 
receptive culture and by European analysts who moved there away from fascist 
oppression. These ideas were then adopted into the American culture. Humanism in 
particular, as described above, was a particularly American approach. There is a 
notion of the 'empty self' and an American theme has been the search for meaning 
and the focus on the individual's story (the empty self is also a possible cause 
in the rise of consumerism and advertising).</p>

<p>In the latter half of the twentieth century, counseling developed 
significantly as a distinct profession, differing from therapy at least in the 
contexts of use and often in the types of issues faced. Counseling happens in 
the social community, in schools and colleges as well as homes. Counseling is 
often paid for by the community or is voluntarily offered (such as the 
Samaritans). Therapy is more likely to be a private practice. Therapy is largely 
found in the therapist's work room. Counseling addresses issues from small to 
large. Therapy tends to deal in the bigger issues. Counseling may be limited. 
Therapy can continue as long as the client is able to pay.</p>
<p>As with other new domains, there has been division of viewpoint and evolution 
of schools of thought. There have been views of counseling and therapy as a 
means to social change. The counselor-client relationship has been questioned. 
Even the dynamics resulting from the structure of expert-patient has been 
questioned.</p>

<p>Throughout the development of counseling and therapy, there has been an 
evolution of though about the way people are perceived and hence treated. In the 
days of the lunatic asylum, people were locked up and treated like animals. 
Freud viewed the person as conflicted and hidden. Behaviorists saw people as 
predictable machines. Humanists had a more botanical image, with ideas of 
feeding and growth. The
<a href="../../explanations/belief/belief_about_people.htm">perception of the 
client</a> can significantly affect the counselor's view and hence how they 
interact with them.</p>
