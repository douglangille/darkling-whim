<h2><a name="des"></a>Description</h2>

<p>Interviews are conversations whereby a candidate interacts with one or more 
people who assess the candidate and, in a selection interview, decide on whether 
this person should be offered a job. </p>

<p>Such interviews typically last 15 to 60 minutes although they can be shorter 
or longer.</p>

<h3>Interview structure</h3>
<p>The structure of an interview is based on the degree of control exerted by 
the interviewer as to the predictability of what questions are asked and what 
information is sought. When there is specific informational needs, then a more 
structured approach may be used. </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Unstructured interviews </i>are unplanned, non-directed, uncontrolled, 
  unformatted, bilateral communications and flexible. They require skills in 
  questioning and probing.</li>
  <li><i>Semi-structured interviews </i>are pre-scheduled, directed but 
  flexible, major topic areas are controlled and there is a focused flow.</li>
  <li><i>Structured interviews </i>are pre-planned, interviewer directed, 
  standardised, pre-formatted and inflexible. They have a full structure and use 
  highly-designed, closed questions. They assume a consistent format will get 
  consistent responses.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Interview types</h3>
<p>There are four common type of selection interview:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Situational interviews </i>use situation-specific questions based on 
  job and look at hypothetical performance. They are conducted by specialists: 
  psychologists or trained people.</li>
  <li><i>Job-related interviews</i> ask about past behaviour on job. They are 
  typically conducted by HR or managers.</li>
  <li><i>Psychological interviews</i> assess personality traits. They are 
  conducted by work/organizational psychologists.</li>
  <li><i>Competency interviews </i>widen psychological interviews to include 
  competencies such as interpersonal skills, leadership and other identified key 
  competencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interviews may involve a varying number of people. One-to-one interviews are 
common, although there are benefits for using multiple interviewers, for example 
where one person asks the questions and the other observes in a more detached 
'third person' position. This objective position can look for body language and 
other subtleties which the person questioning may miss.</p>
<h3>Behavioral interviews</h3>
<p>Behavioral interviews assume that past behaviour is likely to predict 
future behaviour, and the more evidence there is of a previous pattern then the 
more likely it is that it will be repeated in the future.</p>
<p>The interview is developed with <a href="../job_analysis/job_analysis.htm">
Job Analysis</a> and <a href="../job_analysis/critical_incident.htm">Critical 
Incident Technique</a> of effective and ineffective performance, through which a 
range of &#8216;performance dimensions&#8217; are devised that indicate critical categories 
and which provide basis for detailed question themes.</p>
<p>The interviewer then pays particular attention to past behaviours in critical 
categories and also probes for motivations behind behaviours. </p>
<p>Variations include <i>Behavioral Patterned Description Interviews (BPDIs)</i>,
<i>Behavioral Events Interviews </i>and <i>Criterion Referenced Interviews</i>.</p>
<h3>Situational interview</h3>
<p>Situational interviews are based on Latham's 
<a href="../../../explanations/theories/goals.htm">Goal-Setting Theory</a>, which 
assumes intent precedes actions. There is a focus on future (vs. past of 
behavioural methods).</p>
<p>The situational interview is developed by the use of
<a href="../job_analysis/critical_incident.htm">Critical Incidents</a> to devise 
rating scale of behaviours. The costs can be high at around $1000 per question.</p>
<p>The interviewer asks what the person would do in theoretical situations and 
assesses their response against the criteria and rating scale.</p>
<p>A new variant of situational interviews is the &#8216;multimodal&#8217; form, focusing on 
self-presentation, vocabulary assessment, biographical questions and other 
situational aspects.</p>
<p>Situational interviews tend to reduce the chance of discrimination as they 
offer all candidates the same scenarios and evaluate them against the same 
criteria. Candidates also prefer them, as they seems fairer, but it still limits 
their control over proceedings.</p>

<h2><a name="dev"></a>Development</h2>

<h3>Develop questions and scoring</h3>

<p>The first stage of interview development is, if it is not already available, 
a <a href="../job_analysis/job_analysis.htm">job analysis</a> of the position, 
in order to identify key knowledge, experiences, competencies. This may be done 
using sophisticated methods such as often the
<a href="../job_analysis/critical_incident.htm">Critical Incident Technique</a>.</p>

<p>For situational interviews, particular scenarios are identified from which 
situational questions may be derived. For behavioral interviews, the attitudes 
and behaviors required in the job are uncovered.</p>

<p>For a structured approach, questions and scoring can be derived from 
empirical study that may include in-depth analysis of incumbents and interview 
of high performers. Typically 10-15 traits emerge, from which around 120 
questions may be developed around broad situational and behavioral aspects.</p>

<p>Questions should be tested on good/bad performers and around half discarded 
to ensure a consistently high quality of questions. A scoring guide may then be 
developed.</p>

<h3>Train interviewers</h3>

<p>Interviewers should receive some training rather than be plucked from 
management and other ranks and placed in front of an unsuspecting candidate. 
Allport (1937) identified key attributes of interviewers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Breadth of experience and from diverse backgrounds.</li>
  <li>Above average intelligence and have self-insight and understanding of 
  others.</li>
  <li>Emotionally stable, well-adjusted, with good social skills.</li>
  <li>Ability to be detached.</li>
  <li>Similar in some way to interviewee.</li>
  <li>Expertise in role.</li>
</ul>

<p>Important in training is in developing objective rating skills, rather than 
letting the interviewer give way to the sizeable human bias and opinion that 
they may have. </p>

<p>They also need to be seen to be fair (candidates watch for this) and must, of 
course, comply with laws and regulations around gender, ethnicity, age and so 
on. A worst-case interviewer can lay the company open to damaging law suit (both 
financially and reputationally).</p>

<h2><a name="dis"></a>Discussion</h2>

<p>The interview is an extremely common selection method and has a high 
predictive validity for job performance (Robertson and Smith, 2001), indicating 
many factors that are relevant for the communications job, including cognitive 
ability (Huffcutt et al., 1966), oral skills (Campion et al, 1988), social 
skills (Searle, 2003) and person-organisation fit (e.g. Harris, 1999).</p>

<h3>Objectivist psychometric perspective</h3>

<p>In the wonderfully-named <i>objectivist psychometric perspective</i> (i.e. 
traditional viewpoint), there is a focus on structure, reliability and validity, 
based on and assumption that the interview is an objective and accurate means of 
assessment where interviewees are passive participants providing information to 
rational interviewees who are skilled at acquiring and interpreting information.</p>

<p>Criteria used include cognitive ability, job knowledge or tacit knowledge (eg. 
through situational interviewing), social skills (e.g. extraversion, emotional 
stability, openness) and person-organisation fit (though this is fraught with 
difficulties).</p>

<p>There are dangers in this approach, for example in the use of the 
interviewer&#8217;s perception of the organisation, and what it needs. The interviewer 
typically seeks organisation fit by comparing against a simplistic prototype and 
may well assess personal qualities over required skills. 'Fit' may also happen 
at the social level, with the interviewer looking for personal fit with the 
candidate.</p>

<h3>Social-interactionist perspective</h3>

<p>In the <i>social-interactionist perspective</i> (i.e. modern viewpoint), 
there is a focus on social factors and the dynamic process within the interview. 
The interview is seen as a subjective, complex and unique event where both 
parties act as active participant-observers.</p>

<p>The perception of the interviewer is important within this perspective and 
research has shown some interesting factors. Where the interviewer has not paid 
due attention to candidate qualifications, the candidate often draws back, 
becoming more reticent and talking less about themselves (perhaps punishing the 
interviewer for the slight). Candidate expectations depend on how much they like 
the interviewer as the job. The candidate may well feel unfairly treated if not 
given enough attention or opportunity to dialogue, and may well develop negative 
expectations if the interviewer talks more than they do.</p>

<h3>Faking</h3>

<p>Faking is less easy in interviews than CVs or Application Forms, as 
non-verbal signals may be detected. Nevertheless, interviews are so common that 
some interviewees acquire significant expertise in the &#8216;interview technique&#8217;, 
managing impressions and having ready answers for common questions.</p>

<h3>Image Management (IM)</h3>

<p>Faking also may also appear through dress, words and body language, where 
impression-management seeks to make a person appear more than they normally are. 
When the interviewer sees the candidate as over-dressed (or provocatively 
under-dressed!), with excessive make-up or otherwise trying too hard to impress, 
they may suspect them of concealment and mark them down accordingly.</p>
<p>Impression management includes Ingratiating behaviour (agreeing, 
complementing, offering favours), self-promotion (to boost competency range) and 
also anger and intimidation (to show fearlessness). </p>
<p>In studies, women showed more openness and older, more experienced people 
maintained more eye contact, projected a more positive image and asked more 
questions. Older people reduced the number of entitlement statements used and 
increased self-enhancement and self-promotion statements. Where there was more 
role ambiguity, impression management increased.</p>

<h3>Reliability and validity</h3>

<p>Interviews are generally reliable with criterion values of .51 common, rising 
to .63 when used with psychometric tests. The validity is higher for situational 
(.60), job-related (.39), psychological (.29) styles.</p>

<p>Situational interviewing is relatively simplistic and is predominantly used 
in low-complexity jobs. Behavioral interviewing brings in a wider range of 
behaviours from inside and outside work, allows more thorough probing of 
motivations and is preferred for higher-level jobs.</p>

<h3>Bias and misjudgement</h3>

<p>There are many factors in which can bias interviewers, including gender, 
race, age, appearance, attitude, non-verbal behaviour, physical setting and job 
market factors (Avery and Campion, 1982), bias towards positive information and 
even primacy and recency and contrast effects in the ordering of candidates (Asch, 
1946), Miller and Campbell (1959) and (Anderson and Shackleton, 1993). These 
factors may be reduced by training, but often not eliminated.</p>

<p>Within interviews, it is important that fair play is perceived, which 
includes, for example that all candidates should each have a comparable 
experience, even if the interviewer concludes early on that they are not 
suitable.</p>

<p>Interviewers are subject to normal human biases, for example they tend to be 
biased towards &#8216;people like me&#8217;. Positive information is weighted more than 
negative data (which takes more time to process). The order of candidates can 
also cause bias (primacy and recency effects).</p>

<p>The <i>Halo effect</i> happens when one good aspect of candidate makes them 
look good in other areas as well. The reverse is true, and the <i>Horns effect</i> 
occurs where a negative perception is generalized to other aspects of the 
person. A typical horns effect is where the person is overweight and where this 
is generalized into greed, lack of control, lack of social ability, etc.</p>

<p>The generalization continues and candidates who are nervous at interview can 
be generalized as always nervous, whilst the confident may be attributed as 
being skilful in other areas.</p>
