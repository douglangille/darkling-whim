<h2><a name="des"></a>Description</h2>

<p>The Assessment Center is an approach to selection whereby a battery of tests 
and exercises are administered to a person or a group of people across a number 
of hours (usually within a single day).</p>

<p>Assessment centers are particularly useful where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Required skills are complex and cannot easily be assessed with interview 
  or simple tests.</li>
  <li>Required skills include significant interpersonal elements (e.g. 
  management roles).</li>
  <li>Multiple candidates are available and it is acceptable for them to 
  interact with one another.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Individual exercises</h3>

<p>Individual exercises provide information on how the person works by 
themselves. The classic exercise is the <i>in-tray</i>, of which there are many 
variants, but which have a common theme of giving the person an unstructured 
large pile of work and then see how they go about doing it.</p>

<p>Individual exercises (and especially the 'in tray') are very common and have 
a correlation with cognitive ability. Other variants include <i>planning 
exercises</i> (here&#8217;s problems, how will you address them) and <i>case analysis
</i>(here&#8217;s a scenario, what wrong? How would you fix it?).</p>

<h3>One-to-one exercises</h3>

<p>In one-to-one exercises, the candidate interacts in various ways with another 
person, being observed (as with other exercises) by the assessor(s). They are 
often used to assess listening, communication and interpersonal skills, as well 
as other job-related knowledge and skills.</p>

<p>In <i>role-play</i> exercises, the person takes on a role (possibly the job 
being applied for) and interacts with someone who is acting (possibly one of the 
assessors) in a defined scenario. This may range from dealing with a disaffected 
employee to putting a persuasive argument to conducting a fact-finding 
interview. </p>

<p>Other exercises may have elements of role-play but are in more 'normal' 
positions, such as making a presentation or doing an interview (interesting 
reversal!).</p>

<h3>Group exercises</h3>

<p>Group exercises test how people interact in a group, for example showing in 
practice the <a href="../../../explanations/preferences/belbin.htm">Belbin Team 
Roles</a> that they take.</p>

<p>Leaderless group discussions (often of a group of candidates) start with 
everyone on a relatively equal position (although this may be affected by such 
as the shape of the table). </p>

<p>A typical variant is to assign roles to each candidate and give them a brief 
of which others are unaware. These groups can be used to assess such skills as 
negotiation, persuasion, teamwork, planning and organization, decision-making 
and, leadership.</p>

<p>Another variant is simply to give a give topic for group to discuss (has less 
face validity).</p>

<p>Business simulations may be used, sometimes with computers being used to add 
information and determine outcomes of decisions. These often work with 'turns' 
that are made of data given to the group, followed by a discussion and decision 
which is entered into the computer to give the results for the next round.</p>

<p>Relevant topics increases face validity. Studies (Bass, 1954) have shown high inter-rater 
reliability (.82) and test-re-test results (.72).</p>

<h3>Self-assessment exercises</h3>

<p>A neat trick is to ask candidates to assess themselves, for example by asking 
them to rate themselves after each exercise. There is usually a high correlation between candidate and assessor ratings (indicating honesty).</p>

<p>Ways of improving these exercises include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Increasing length of assessment form to include behavioral dimensions based 
on selection competencies</li>
  <li>Change instructions to promote a more realistic appraisal by applicant of 
their skills</li>
  <li>Imply that candidate would be held accountable if a discrepancy is found 
between their and assessor ratings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those with low self-assessment accuracy are likely to find behavioral 
modification and adaptation difficult (perhaps as they have low emotional 
intelligence).</p>

<h2><a name="dev"></a>Development</h2>

<p>Developing assessment centers involves much test development, although much 
can be selected 'off the shelf'. A key area of preparation is with assessors, on 
whose judgment candidates will be rejected and selected.</p>

<h3>Identify criteria</h3>

<p>Identify the criteria by which you will assess the candidates. Derive these 
from a sound <a href="../job_analysis/job_analysis.htm">job analysis</a>.</p>

<p>Keep the number of criteria low -- less than six is good -- in order to help 
assessors remember and focus. This also helps simplify the final judgment 
process. </p>

<h3>Develop exercises</h3>

<p>Make exercises as realistic as possible. This will help both candidates and 
assessors and will give a good idea what the candidate is like in real 
situations.</p>

<p>Design the exercises around the criteria so they can be identified rather 
than find a nice exercise and see if you can spot any useful criteria. Allow for 
confirmation <i>and</i> for disconfirmation of criteria.</p>

<p>Include clear guidelines for player so they can get 'into' the exercises as 
easily as possible. You should be assessing them on the exercise, not on their 
memory.</p>

<p>Include guidelines also for role-players, assessors and also for those who 
will set up the exercises (eg. what parts to include in exercise packs, how to 
set them up ready for use, etc.).</p>

<p>Triangulate for results across multiple exercises so each exercise supports 
others, showing different facets of the person and their behavior against the 
criteria.</p>

<h3>Select assessors</h3>

<p>Select assessors based on their ability to make effective judgments. Gender 
is not important, but age and rank are.</p>

<p>There are two approaches to selecting assessors. You can use a small pool of assessors who become better at the job, or you can 
use many people to help diffuse acceptance of the candidates and the selection 
method.</p>

<p>Do use assessors who are aware of organizational norms and values (this 
militates against using external assessors), but do also include specialists, 
e.g. organizational psychologists (who may well be external, unless you are in a 
large company).</p>

<h3>Develop tools for assessors</h3>

<p>Asking assessors to make personal judgments is likely to result in bias. 
Tools can be developed to help them score candidates accurately and 
consistently.</p>

<p>Include <i>behavioral checklists</i> (lists of behaviors that display 
criteria) and <i>behavioral coding</i> that uses prepared data-gathering sheets (this 
standardizes 
between-gatherers data).</p>

<p>Traditional assessment has a process of observe, record, classify, evaluate.
<i>Schema-based</i> assessment has examples of poor, average and good behavior (there 
is no separation of evaluation and observation).</p>

<h3>Prepare assessors and others</h3>

<p>Ensure the people who will be assessing, role-playing, etc. are ready 
beforehand. The assessment center should not be a learning exercise for 
assessors.</p>

<p>Two days of training are better than one. Include theory of social information processing, interpersonal 
judgment, 
social cognition and decision-making theory.</p>

<p>Make assessors responsible for giving feedback to candidates and accountable to 
organization for their decisions. 
This encourages them to be careful with their assessments.</p>

<h3>Run the assessment center</h3>

<p>If you have planned everything well, it will go well. Things to remember 
include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Directions to the center sent well beforehand, including by road, rail and 
  air.</li>
  <li>Welcome for candidates, with refreshments and waiting area between 
  exercises.</li>
  <li>Capturing feedback from assessors immediately after sessions.</li>
  <li>A focus with assessors on criteria.</li>
  <li>Swift and smooth correction of assessors who are not using criteria.</li>
  <li>A timetable for everyone that runs on time.</li>
  <li>Lunch! Coffee breaks!</li>
  <li>Thanks to everyone involved.</li>
  <li>Finishing the exercises in time for the assessors to do the final 
  scoring/discussion session.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Follow-up</h3>

<p>After the center, follow up with candidates and assessors as appropriate. A 
good practice is to give helpful feedback to candidates who are unsuccessful so 
they can understand their strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<h2><a name="dis"></a>Discussion</h2>

<p>Assessments have grown hugely in popularity. In 1973 only about 7% of 
companies were using them. By the mid-1980s, this had grown to 20%, and by the 
end of the 1990s it had leapt again to 65%.</p>

<p>Assessment centers allow assessment of <i>potential </i>skill and so are good 
when seeking new recruits. They allows a wide range of criteria to be assessed, 
including group activity and aggregations of higher-level, managerial 
competences.</p>

<p>Assessment centers are not cheap to put on and require multiple assessors who 
must be available. Organizational psychologists can be of particular value to 
assess and identify the subtler aspects of behavior.</p>

<h3>Origins</h3>

<p>The assessment center was originated by AT&amp;T, who included the following nine 
components:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Business game</li>
  <li>Leaderless group discussion</li>
  <li>In-tray exercise</li>
  <li>Two-hour interview</li>
  <li>Projective test</li>
  <li>Personality test</li>
  <li>&#8216;q sort&#8217;</li>
  <li>intelligence tests</li>
  <li>Autobiographical essay and questionnaire</li>
</ol>

<h3>Validity</h3>

<p>Reliability and validity is difficult, as there are so many parts and so much 
variation. A 1966 study showed high validity in identifying middle managers. 
There is a lower adverse effect on individuals than separate tests (eg. 
psychometrics).</p>

<h3>Criticisms</h3>

<p>The outcome of assessment centers are based on the judgments of the 
assessors and hence the quality of those judgments. Not only are judgments 
subject to human bias but they also are affected by the group psychology effects 
of assessors interacting.</p>

<p>Assessors often deviate from marking schemes, often collapsing multiple 
criteria into a generic &#8216;performance&#8217; criterion. This is often due to 
overburdening of assessors with more than 4-5 criteria (so use less). More 
attention is often given to direct observation than other data (eg. psychometric 
tests). Assessors even use their own private criteria &#8211; especially 
organizational fit.</p>
