<p class="smaller" align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p>One description of people at work and their performance is as A-, B- and 
C-players, where A-players are the high-achieving stars, the B-players are the 
solid, good-enough middle team and the C-players are the very limited 
bottom-end. </p>
<h2><a name="sol"></a>Solid C-players</h2>
<p>Some C-players are very good at very little, but when that is all you need, 
this is just fine. If you do not want innovation or flexibility beyond their 
ability or motivation, then this is probably a time to let sleeping dogs lie.</p>
<p>Manage the solid C-players by telling them clearly what is wanted, keeping an 
eye on them until you are confident that they will keep doing what you need and 
then back off, only stepping to ensure they keep on track.</p>
<p>Like a good machine, a solid C-player only needs occasional maintenance and 
will happily do a basic job for as long as you care to employ them. They do not 
seek glory, high reward or promotion -- all they want is a steady job and enough 
money to pay their relatively low bills.</p>
<p>(Note: depending on the definition, 'C-players' sometimes implies poor 
performers or problematic people, in which case there are of course no solid 
C-players).</p>
<h2><a name="pro"></a>Problem C-players</h2>
<p>Some C-players are not solid, requiring more management intervention than 
should be necessary. Problems typically fall into three categories: motivation, 
performance and personal, each of which requires particular attention.</p>
<h3>Three types of problem</h3>
<p><i>Motivation problems</i> occur for example where the C-player finds the work 
boring or perhaps is aggrieved at their C-player rating. For self-esteem, we 
often like to think we are better than we really are, and many C-players believe 
themselves to be B-players or even A stars.</p>
<p><i>Performance problems</i> occur where they simply do not have the skills to do 
their jobs. This may be spread across the range of activities involved or be 
specific skills which bring down their overall performance.</p>
<p><i>Personal problems</i> can happen both at work and outside. At work, they 
may be difficult to get on with or otherwise have social issues, from 
dysfunctional introversion to being unpleasantly smelly. Outside of work, other 
callings may distract or drag them away from good performance, from family 
issues to medical problems. These can be tricky, as they may have legitimate 
reason, yet the dilemma still falls your way as they are unable to do their job 
properly.</p>
<p>Problem C-players can show up in the upper ranks of an organization, where 
issues can include the 'Peter Principle' of being promoted to their level of 
incompetence, or people 'retiring on the job', treating promotion as a reason not 
to work and fobbing it all off those below them.</p>
<h3>Managing the problems</h3>
<p>Managing problem C-players is generally a classic process of performance 
management. First draw attention to the issue in a formal setting -- casual 
requests to improve are far less likely to be recognized as being serious. Be 
tactful, but honest, testing that they truly understand that there is a problem 
and you are not going to let it lie. </p>
<p>If they have personal problems, carefully 
probe to find the facts. Beware of pathological C-players making these up or 
exaggerating them. Also be reasonably trusting and always careful to stay within 
the rules -- it is easy to fall foul of employment legislation on personal 
matters.</p>
<p>Get input also from others, in a 360-degree process that gets honest and fair 
feedback. When people see how others view them, they can often be shocked into 
action. <br>
Give them specific and realistic goals to achieve, within a specific timescale. 
Make sure they have everything they need to do the job (no excuses!), giving 
them training if necessary. Then review their performance on the date agreed at 
the first meeting. Beware of excuses for poor performance or motivation -- 
C-players usually have many ready excuses for their failings. You can also give 
them to a B- or A-player as a management development opportunity, if this seems 
likely to be most effective. In any case, the C-players managers must be held 
accountable for effectively managing them.</p>
<p>If they are unable to improve, find a way of getting them into a position 
where they can contribute to the extent of their true ability and motivation. 
This is not always easy, as 'the right job' is seldom ready to hand. Again, be 
careful to stay within the rules if you are changing their terms of employment.</p>
<p>Finally, if other methods are unsuccessful (or if you lack the options to try 
other things), manage their exit. More than any other activity this is fraught 
with hazard and you must follow due process, for example giving two written 
warnings and a final warning.</p>
<p>Managing problem employees is not easy, but if you cannot do it or 
procrastinate, you might ask the even more difficult question of what level of 
player you are.</p>
<h2><a name="tox"></a>Toxic C-players</h2>
<h3>The toxic condition</h3>
<p>Some C-players are not only problematic, they are positively damaging, 
harming relationships and the overall business. Some of these players may appear 
as A-players in their personal performance, always meeting and exceeding goals, 
yet they do so at a greater cost to the company, trampling on others and using 
people callously and generally spreading gloom and demotivation wherever they 
go. Toxic activities include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Taking credit where it is not due</li>
  <li>Blaming others for your errors</li>
  <li>Blocking advancement of good people</li>
  <li>Inappropriate questioning of management decisions</li>
  <li>Turning other people into C-players</li>
  <li>Recruiting 'yes-men' who will not challenge or think for themselves</li>
  <li>Putting off good people from joining</li>
  <li>Demotivating good people, thus depressing their performance</li>
</ul>
<p>Toxic C-players often have some kind of psychological condition, including 
<a href="../../../explanations/personality/disorders/narcissistic_personality.htm">
narcissism</a> and
<a href="../../../explanations/personality/disorders/psychopath.htm">psychopathy</a>, such that they lack 
<a href="../../../explanations/emotions/empathy.htm">empathy</a> and just do not care 
about others. They may be adept at hiding this with shows of concern and 
interest, but the bottom line is that they are your friend only as long as the 
value is flowing from you to them, and they will dump you or worse at the drop 
of a hat.</p>
<p>Toxic C-players may be found in the upper echelons of the company, 
where they seem safe from being fired and where they can gain and use power on a 
grand scale. This can also make them difficult to manage, as they typically 
drive themselves and brook no interference. In particular they are unlikely to 
take any real notice of any attempt to manage their behavior, although they may 
play along sufficiently to get you out of their hair.</p>
<p>These players can also be found lower down the order. There, they may spread 
their poison by gossip and innuendo. Their disaffection may come from being 
passed over for promotion or otherwise feeling slighted. They also may just be 
grumpy folks who like nothing better than a good bitch about other people or the 
company in general.</p>
<h3>Managing toxic players</h3>
<p>Managing toxic C-players is no mean feat, and if they get you in their 
sights, they might win the battle, which they may well take very personally.</p>
<p>For senior managers, it may be better to get professional help from a 
qualified executive coach or psychoanalyst. You might have to cloak the purpose 
in benefits for them, such as grooming for the next level up. An early job here 
is to get a reliable diagnosis -- if they are deeply toxic with no realistic 
chance of treatment then the best best is usually to plan either for their exit 
or some form of containment, for example by appointing a more tactful COO to 
work with a toxic CEO.</p>
<p>For those who are more manageable, the treatment is similar to those with 
performance problems, although if the toxic player is causing significant damage 
then the process may need to be accelerated.</p>
<h2><a name="the"></a>The no-C-player strategy</h2>
<p>One strategy that some companies take is simply to eliminate C-players. In an 
'up or out' culture, if you are not promoted within a year or two of being in a 
post, then you are on your way out of the company.</p>
<p>Such strategies must, of course, be legal, and suit some industries more than 
others, for example where long experience is less important than raw 
intelligence and hard work, and where a ready supply of new applicants is 
available.</p>
