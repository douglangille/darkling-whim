<p>Eleri was a highly successful and respected teacher who managed the whole 
teaching triumvirate: she had strong discipline, she got great grades and the 
kids loved her. Here are her rules for teaching that she lived by for many 
years.</p>
<h2><a name="res"></a>Respect</h2>
<p>In a traditional classroom, the students respect the power of the teacher, if 
not the teacher. Yet the fundamental platform for teaching is a much fuller 
respect. First of all, respect means accepting the person, while disrespect can 
be seen when people are treated with contempt or disdain.</p>
<p>Using respect is not just wanting it, but using a three-way respect triangle: 
respect them, expect respect from them, and require them to respect one another.</p>
<h3>Respect them</h3>
<p>The first and last rule is that the teacher should always respect their 
students, with no exceptions. Even if they are disrespectful, you must still 
respect them. This can be hard at first, but with practice it becomes easy (and 
indeed it is eventually hard not to respect them). They are people, just like 
you. They are also trying to grow up, which is a really tough and scary job.</p>
<p>It is alarming how some teachers seem not to particularly like children. If 
you do not like them, go find another profession. You'll feel better for doing 
so.</p>
<h3>Expect respect</h3>
<p>Respecting them means accepting them, but not necessarily how they behave. 
Disrespect includes talking when they should be listening, not doing work you 
set them, acting aggressively and so on.</p>
<p>When they act disrespectfully, name the game, telling them directly that 
behaving like this is not acceptable. If you use discipline for anything, use it 
for lack of respect. </p>
<p>Many students, when you respect them, really appreciate this and will be far 
readier to return respect to you. </p>
<h3>Respect one another</h3>
<p>Beyond the two-way respect between you and each student, ensure they act 
respectfully towards one another. Have zero tolerance when they speak unkindly, 
bully or show racial, gender or other bias towards one another. </p>
<p>When you call out disrespect, you may also find that others in the class will 
also join in. When this happens, be careful that this does not become a 
reversal, where the disrespectful student becomes a subject of disrespect.</p>
<p>Children (and adults) notice and copy how you act. If you establish respect 
as essential, they will more readily take it us as a way of behaving with 
others.</p>
<h2><a name="lis"></a>Listen</h2>
<p>Traditional teaching was based on the teacher spouting knowledge at the front 
of the class. The students were vessels and the teacher was the dispenser of 
water. However, this is not the best way and will not always lead to them 
respecting you.</p>
<p><a href="../../../techniques/listening/listening.htm">Listening</a> to them 
helps you understand how they are thinking, how they understand and 
misunderstand, and so allows you to shape the lesson to maximize learning. 
Listening and understanding also helps you respect them. Everyone likes to be 
listened to, so listening also helps them respect you. Your listening also 
encourages them to listen in return.</p>
<p>Yes, there is a time for listening and a time for you to take control. When 
they talk, it should mostly be about the subject. Depending on the strength of 
discipline you hold, you can allow small diversions, but never let them lead you 
down the garden path.</p>
<h2><a name="exp"></a>Explore</h2>
<p>Traditional teaching promotes a fixed lesson plan with activities that happen 
on schedule. Learning does not happen like this and a good lesson is measured by 
the number of 'aha's, not by ticking boxes of what 'should' be done.</p>
<p>Instead, have intent rather than a fixed and single path. Have a general 
direction rather than a sharp vector. Hold the reins, but hold them loosely. 
Push them forward and watch where they go. Respect and encourage their 
curiosity. Be curious yourself. Be ready for the lesson to go in unexpected 
directions, in search of new understanding. Seek out 'aha's wherever they may 
be. </p>
<p>Show them how to remain open to possibility. Teach them that there can be 
more than one answer and that the obvious way is not always the best way. Do not 
discount or criticize ideas without exploring how they appeared in the first 
place. Use words like 'how', 'where', 'interesting' and 'surprising'.</p>
<p>This is not always easy. You need to understand your subject well. You need 
to be able to teach differently at a moment's notice as you are always ready for 
variation from where you may have hoped you might go.</p>
<h2><a name="thi"></a>Think</h2>
<p>Teaching is not just about presenting knowledge and getting them to reproduce 
what you tell them. Far better is to teach them to think, so they can respond 
from understanding rather than just a good memory.</p>
<p>To get them to think, ask good
<a href="../../../techniques/questioning/questioning.htm">questions</a>. Then 
listen and explore, prodding them to think even deeper. Ask 'Why do you think 
that?' and 'What else could be true?'&nbsp; Show you like that they are thinking 
and respect their thought processes. Offer them new ways to think about things 
through exploration and open possibility.</p>
<p>To think in increasingly complex ways is human and raises us above the 
animals. When you teach them to think, you give them a platform on which to 
build a successful life.</p>
<h2><a name="rea"></a>Reason</h2>
<p>Teaching is not about just getting them to accept the reasoning of other 
people. Far better is to help them to work things out for themselves. Even if 
their ideas are unconventional, if the reasoning is good, then be ready to 
accept something different.</p>
<p>When they tell you what they are thinking, get them to explain why they think 
their suggestions are right. Get them to understand cause and effect by asking 
'why' and 'how'. </p>
<h2><a name="deb"></a>Debate</h2>
<p>Not only should they reason with their arguments with you, but also with each 
other. Get them to debate topics, learning how to persuade with reason as well 
as passion. This is a skill, like many of the others here, that are very useful 
in life and not just for passing exams.</p>
<p>Debate is a good way to test reason as it encourages challenge of the 
reasoning of others. It encourages students to think carefully about what they 
think and why they think this. They learn to defend arguments rather than just 
rolling over and accepting criticism. They also learn to listen to the arguments 
of others and to change their views if other reasoning is better than their own.</p>
<p>As a teacher, you are the conductor and facilitator, ensuring fair play and 
that everyone has a turn to speak. Encourage those who speak less while not 
quashing those who get particularly enthusiastic. Help individuals to think, 
reason and listen to others.</p>
<p>Encourage constructive discussion as well as win-lose debate. Get them to 
bounce ideas off one another and build on what has already been proposed. </p>
<h2><a name="enj"></a>Enjoy</h2>

<p>And throughout it all, enjoy yourself as a teacher as you help young people 
become adult, transitioning from dependence to independence. What you do and 
whatever your subject, you are building citizens of tomorrow. Though the subject 
may vary, the pleasure you can gain from turning on light bulbs of understanding 
is like no other job.</p>
<p>Also help them to enjoy it. Measure your success in 'aha's and 'oho's. 
Empathize with their struggles and get vicarious and empathetic thrills in 
watching them learn and enjoy the process of learning. If you can do this, 
teaching that learning is fun, then you will have set them up for life.</p>
