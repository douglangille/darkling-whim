<h2><a name="des"></a>Description</h2>

<p>In the Oedipus complex, a boy is fixated on his mother and competes with his 
father for maternal attention.  </p>

<p>The opposite, the attraction of a girl to her father and rivalry with her 
mother, is sometimes called the Electra complex.</p>

<h3>Sexual awakening</h3>
<p>At some point, the child realizes that there is a difference between their 
mother and their father. Around the same time they realize that they are more 
alike to one than the other. Thus the child acquires gender.</p>
<p>The child may also form some kind of erotic attachment to the parent of the 
opposite sex. Whilst their understanding of the full sexual act may be 
questioned, some kind of primitive physical sensations are felt when they regard 
and think about the parent in question.</p>
<h3>Jealousies</h3>
<p>The primitive desire for the one parent may also awaken in the child a 
jealous motivation to exclude the other parent.</p>
<p>Transferring of affections may also occur as the child seeks to become 
independent and escape a perceived 'engulfing mother'.</p>
<p>A critical point of awakening is where the child realizes that the mother has 
affections for others besides itself.</p>
<p>Primitive jealousies are not necessarily constrained to the child and and 
both parents may join in the game, both in terms of competing with each other 
for the child's affections and also competing with the child for the affection 
of the other parent.</p>
<p>Note that opposition to parents may not necessarily be sexually based -- this 
can also be a part of the struggle to assert one's identity and rebellion 
against parental control.</p>
<h3>The process of transitioning</h3>
<p>A critical aspect of the Oedipal stage is loosening of the ties to the 
mother of vulnerability, dependence and intimacy. This is a natural part of the child becoming more independent and is 
facilitated by the realization that the mother desires more than just the child.</p>
<p>The Oedipal move blocks the routes of sexual and <a href="identfication.htm">
identification</a> love back to the mother. She becomes a separate object, 
removed from his ideal self. Thus she <i>can </i>be the subject of object love.</p>
<p>This separation and externalization of love allows a transition away from
<a href="narcissism.htm">narcissism</a> of earlier stages.</p>
<p>The father's role in this is much debated. In a number of accounts, such as
<a href="../theorists/lacan.htm">Lacan's</a>
<a href="symbolic_register.htm">symbolic register</a>, the child 
transitions their attentions from mother to father.</p>
<p>The father effectively says 'You must be like me -- you may not be like the 
mother -- you must wait to love her, as I do.' The child thus also learns to 
wait and share attention.</p>
<h3>Separation</h3>
<p>The boy thus returns to the mother as a separate individual. That separation 
may be emphasized with scorn and a sense of mastery over women. that can also be seen in the long separation of 
boys and girls in play and social relationships. This is a source of male 
denigration of women.</p>
<p>Women become separated reminders of lost and forbidden unity. Their unique 
attributes, from softness to general femininity are, in consequence, also lost 
and must be given up as a part of the distancing process. Women become thus both 
desired and feared. The symbolic <a href="../articles/infant_sexuality.htm">
phallus</a> becomes a means of protection for the boy and the rituals of mastery 
used to cover up feelings of loss.</p>
<p>Separation leads to unavailability and hence the
<a href="../../../principles/scarcity.htm">scarcity principle</a> takes effect, 
increasing <a href="desire.htm">desire</a>. Women thus create a tension in boys 
between a lost paradise and dangerous sirens.</p>
<p>Excessive separation leads to a sense of helplessness that can in turn lead 
to patterns of idealized control and self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>Whilst the boy becomes separated from the mother, it is a long time before he 
can be independent of her and hence must develop a working relationship that may 
reflect the tension of love and difference he feels.</p>
<p>The relationship thus may return to a closer mother-son tie, where the point 
of healthy distance is a dynamically negotiated position, such that comforting 
is available but is required only upon occasion.</p>
<h3>What about the girls?</h3>
<p>Most writings about the Oedipal stage focus largely or exclusively on boys, 
who are seen to have a particular problem as they start with an attachment to 
the Mother that they have to relinquish both from the point of view of 
individual independence and especially as a result of the social incest taboo 
which forbids excessively-close in-family relationships. </p>
<p>The Electra complex, identified by Carl Jung, occurs where a triangle of mother-father-daughter plays out is 
not a part of traditional psychoanalysis. It is neither a direct mirror image of 
Oedipus, as the start position is female-female connection.</p>
<p>Jung suggested that when the girl discovers she lacks penis that her father 
possesses, she imagines she will gain one if he makes her pregnant, and so moves 
emotionally closer to him. She thus resents her mother who she believe castrated 
her.</p>
<p>The father symbolizes attractive power and a potentially hazardous 
male-female relationship is formed, with predictable jealousies and envy as the 
mother completes the triangle. The dangers of incestuous abuse add, and perhaps 
develop, the female position of siren temptation.</p>
<p>Girls, as well as boys, need to find independence and their separation from the mother is 
a matter of creating a separate femininity. This is not as strong a separation 
as boys and girls can sustain a closer female-female relationships with the 
mothers. This perhaps explains something of why relationships with others is a 
more important part of a female life than it is for a male.</p>
<p>The father does provide a haven from female-female jealousies, and so a 
healthy father-daughter relationship may be built, that also includes 
appropriate distance. As with mother-son, once the incest taboos are 
established, a uniquely satisfying opposite-sex relationship can be built, 
although secret desires for the father can result in the girl feeling some guilt 
about the relationship.</p>

<h2><a name="dis"></a>Discussion</h2>
<p>There are three common threads in the Oedipus complex: The primacy of the 
desire for one-ness, the maternal embodiment of this and the necessity of 
paternal intervention.</p>

<h3>Historical Oedipus</h3>

<p>In the Greek play by Sophocles, Laius, king of Thebes, is told by an oracle 
that he would be killed by his son and so leaves Oedipus out on the mountainside 
to die. Oedipus is rescued by a shepherd and taken to the king of Corinth who 
raises him as a son. </p>
<p>Oedipus, in turn, is told by the Delphic oracle that he will kill his father 
and marry his mother. Horrified by this, he flees Corinth. At a crossroads he 
meets Laius, quarrels and kills him. At Thebes, he correctly answers the 
sphinx's question and hence wins the hand of Jocasta, his real mother, with whom 
he had two sons and two daughters. When at last the truth comes out, Jocasta 
hangs herself and Oedipus, finding her, blinds himself with her golden brooch.</p>
<p>Electra was the daughter of Agamemnon who helped plan the murder of her 
mother.</p>
<h3>Freud</h3>

<p><a href="../theorists/freud.htm">Freud</a> puts the Oedipal stage as 
occurring 
between 3-5 years. He considers it a stage where 
the child experiences an erotic attachment to one parent and hostility toward 
the other parent. The ensuing triangular tension is seen as being the root of 
most mental disorders.</p>
<p>Freud cites the incest taboo as as at the root of many other prohibitions. He 
sees the struggle against this as a core part of this development period with 
transgressions in practice and phantasy.</p>
<p class="quote">'We cannot get away from the assumption that man's sense of 
guilt springs from the Oedipus complex and was acquired at the killing of the 
father by the brothers banned together'. (Freud, 1930)</p>
<p>Freud links the Oedipus complex with development the superego, which uses 
guilt to prevent continuation of incestuously oriented relationships. </p>
<p>Failure to get past this trigger point and into the symbolic order is 
considered to be a classic cause of lasting neurosis.</p>

<h3>Lacan</h3>
<p>For <a href="../theorists/lacan.htm">Lacan</a>, the mother is characterized by 'lack' of a phallus. The 
pre-Oedipal child tries to make good the lack. But the mother desires the 
phallus that will cover over her division in language. The child then realizes 
its own lack, or 'castration' and seeks to speak or use words such that it can 
stand in for that which is missing. </p>
<p>The child can hence either speak itself from 
the position of 'having the phallus' or lacking it. Having a penis, boys are 
more likely to take the former position. However, taking this position requires 
living up to the god-like status of having the phallus.</p>

<p>Note that Lacan considered that the Oedipal stage can be successfully 
navigated without the father, as long as cultural norms and prohibitions can be 
met, as it is these, rather than the father himself which facilitates the way 
through</p>
<h3>Rose</h3>
<p>Jacqueline Rose uses Lacan to show how sexual identity is acquired through 
the Oedipus crisis, rather than being something innate.</p>
<h3>Klein</h3>
<p><a href="../theorists/klein.htm">
Melanie Klein</a>, through her work with young children, saw Oedipal conflict 
occurring much earlier than Freud and involving part-objects rather than whole 
parent-figures, and including infantile sadism. How early this starts has been 
questioned including a consideration that some version of the Oedipal stage 
occurring almost from the very beginning, at least in
<a href="phantasy_fantasy.htm">phantasy</a>. She see emotional and 
sexual development occurring:</p>
<p class="quote">&nbsp;'...from early infancy onwards includes genital 
sensations and trends, which constitute the first stages of the inverted [desire 
toward the same-sex parent and aggression toward opposite sex one] and positive 
Oedipus complex.' (Klein, 1945)</p>
<p>She places the Oedipal complex as occurring in the
<a href="paranoid_schizoid.htm">paranoid-schizoid position</a>, where 
the infant's world is largely <a href="splitting.htm">split</a> and 
relations are mainly to <a href="object.htm">part-objects</a>. Thus the 
Oedipal stage involves working through the paranoid-schizoid position to the
<a href="depressive.htm">depressive position</a>.</p>
<p>As well as the classic early Oedipus complex, Klein also identifies the <i>
Oedipal situation</i> which occurs throughout life.</p>
<p>She saw how children realizes a 
sexual link between parents at an early age, but perceives it through the 
infantile experience, thus conceiving of feeding one another, devouring one 
another, or even exchanging bodily excretions.</p>
<h3>Bion</h3>
<p><a href="../theorists/bion.htm">Wilfred Bion</a> placed the Oedipus complex even earlier than Klein, hypothesizing an 
innate oedipal preconception.</p>
<p>He related <a href="../../../explanations/groups/basic_assumption.htm">pairing</a> to the Oedipal 
stage and the importance of the family group. Early group setting are familial 
or kinship and these are used as later templates for group activity, and early 
anxieties may reappear.</p>
<h3>Other notes</h3>
<p>A common experience in families is that the opposite gender relationships of 
mother-son and father-daughter are stronger than same-sex relationships, where 
there may be intra-gender rivalries, for example where the daughter continues to 
compete with the mother for the father's attention. In most cases, the incest 
taboo holds and this is a relatively harmless attachment.</p>
<p>Oedipus represents responsibility and guilt, in contrast to Narcissus, who 
represents self-involvement and denial of reality. Oedipus is an escape from 
early fantasy of omnipotence.</p>
<p>The gender polarity that Oedipus creates is echoed in modern feminist 
concerns and male confusion as rights issues erode instinctive positions.</p>
<p>Moving away from the mother, for the boy, is also a part of instilling the 
incest taboo.</p>
