<p class="smaller" align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you meet opposition during a negotiation, what do you do? The first step 
is to understand whether the person is using deliberate
<a href="../tactics/tactics.htm">tactics</a> to trip you up or whether they have 
a genuine and reasonable reason to disagree with you.</p>

<h2><a name="und"></a>Understanding real opposition</h2>

<p>Before assuming the other person is opposing you for unreasonable reasons, it 
is worth taking a moment or two to get a better view of the situation.</p>

<h3>Stand back</h3>

<p>A good first step when you meet opposition is to stand back and look at what 
is happening. Are you the cause of their opposition? Are they reacting to 
something you said? Maybe you have offended them in some way. </p>

<p>Notice also how you are viewing them. Are you framing them to yourself as an 
'enemy' or 'bad guy' in some way? Do you see them as someone to overcome? How 
you think about them will affect your words and body language.</p>

<h3>Stand in their shoes</h3>

<p>To understand the other person better, it can be very illuminating to see 
things from their point of view. Take on the mantle of their
<a href="../../../explanations/belief/belief.htm">beliefs</a>,
<a href="../../../explanations/values/values.htm">values</a> and
<a href="../../../explanations/preferences/preferences.htm">preferences</a> and 
see how the world looks. Understand how their
<a href="../../../explanations/motivation/goals.htm">goals</a> are driving to do 
what they are doing. See what other influences are affecting them. </p>

<p class="quote"><i>I can see how important it is for you that you get home 
early today.</i></p>

<h3>Step to their side</h3>

<p>A most disarming approach is to 
<a href="../../../techniques/general/reframing.htm">reframe</a> the negotiation not as a competition 
but as a collaborative problem-solving exercise. Using the words 'we', 'us' and 
'our' makes 'you' and 'me' irrelevant. We are a social species and the offer of 
working with someone rather than against them can be a tempting offer in many 
situations.</p>

<p class="quote"><i>What we need to do is figure out what we must do today, then 
we can take a look at how tomorrow will affect each of us.</i></p>

<h3>Depersonalize the problem</h3>

<p>Talking about 'the problem' turns it into a concrete 'thing' that you can 
figuratively put in front of you (especially if you draw or write about it). 
Making it a thing stops it from belonging to one person or another and turns it 
into something separate.</p>

<p class="quote"><i>How can we make sure that the work gets done in time?</i></p>

<p>Creating a joint problem also supplants individual wants and positions. By 
including their needs and your needs into the same problem, you bring the 
negotiators together. </p>

<h2><a name="man"></a>Managing negative tactics</h2>

<p>When they start using <a href="../tactics/tactics.htm">tactics</a>, the first 
step is to see what they are doing and then you can act to defuse them. When you 
show the other person that you have caught them in the act of using socially 
doubtful methods, you may <a href="../../../explanations/emotions/shame.htm">
shame</a> them into more collaborative working.</p>

<h3>Go around blocks</h3>

<p>When they refuse to negotiate, rather than meeting them head on in pointless 
argument, find ways of going around the blocks they place in your way. When they 
see that you can get around their obstinacy, many people will remove the block 
and negotiate more cooperatively rather than be left trying to fight with 
nothing.</p>

<p class="quote"><i>Well, if you are not able to change my settings then, 
perhaps I could talk to your supervisor about it now.</i> </p>

<h3>Expose tricks</h3>

<p>When they use deceptive methods, show that you can see what they are doing. 
Name the game. Show that you have a full understanding of deceptive methods. 
When you do not use them yourself, even though you understand them, you are 
taking a higher moral position.</p>

<p class="quote"><i>Are you trying to throw me a red herring? It's a neat trick 
but I can see what you are doing. It will be more effective if we work together 
on this rather than playing games.</i> </p>

<h3>Resist coercion</h3>

<p>When they use bully-boy tactics on you, show your courage and stand up to 
them. Most bullies are also cowards and will back down when confronted.</p>

<p class="quote"><i>You can threaten me with leaving, but I will not be 
persuaded by such methods. I would rather you stay, but to use that as a weapon 
is unacceptable.</i></p>

<h2><a name="cra"></a>Cranking the tension</h2>

<p>Whilst getting closer to the other person and defusing negative tactics, you 
may also want to crank up the <a href="../../../principles/tension.htm">tension</a> 
that will drive them into more <a href="../styles/collaborative_negotiation.htm">
collaborative</a> behavior.</p>

<h3>Use easy agreement</h3>

<p>The first step is to go for agreement. Find those things that they will 
accept without argument. Get them saying 'yes' with a
<a href="../../sales/closing/yes-set_close.htm">yes-set</a> of questions with 
which they can easily agree. Find easy 'no-brainer' trades that are hard to 
refuse. <a href="guiding_decisions.htm">Guide their decisions</a>, making it 
clear for them how advantageous it is to agree with you.</p>

<p class="quote"><i>Do you care about your family? Do you want them to be safe 
in a storm? Would a refuge shelter like this be a safe place in a storm?</i></p>

<p class="quote"><i>There's no need to sign up yet -- we've a trial system you 
can use free for a month.</i></p>

<h3>Use difficult disagreement</h3>

<p>If they do not take the carrots that you offer them, the next step is to show 
that you can use a stick. A sadly large number of people have
<a href="../../../explanations/belief/belief_about_people.htm">beliefs about 
others</a> that assume a 'dog eat dog' combative world, and the only way to earn 
their respect is to demonstrate strength. You may have already done this in your
<a href="../eight-stage/open.htm">opening</a> and <a href="../eight-stage/argue.htm">
argument</a>, but trying to be collaborative and using easy agreement may lead 
to them reverting to dominant behavior.</p>

<p>Show them consequences of not collaborating with you. Use a
<a href="../tactics/forced_choice.htm">forced choice</a>, whereby only one 
option is acceptable for them. Use steadily more coercive methods (within 
acceptable <a href="../../../explanations/theories/social_norms.htm">social 
norms</a>) to get them to negotiate with you.</p>

<p class="quote"><i>If you don't let him go, then what do you think he will do 
to you?</i></p>

<p class="quote"><i>We can go to the opera , a rock concert or my parents. </i></p>

<h3>Steadily expose your walk-away alternative</h3>

<p>The final step is to steadily expose and <a href="deploying_walkaway.htm">
deploy</a> your <a href="../articles/walk-away.htm">walk-away alternative</a>. 
When the other person sees that you are prepared to back out and that you will 
not be hurt by this action, then they must face the consequences for them (which 
you can also expose). This can be very concerning for them if their walk-away is 
worse than yours (which it very likely will be, if you are well-<a href="../eight-stage/prepare.htm">prepared</a>.</p>

<p class="quote"><i>You know, I was thinking of offering this to Sam.</i></p>

<p class="quote"><i>I know that Sam would be interested in taking this 
assignment.</i></p>

<p class="quote"><i>Well, if you can't afford the time, Sam will get the work. 
I've already worked out how he can offload his current activities.</i></p>
