<p class="smaller" align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first stage for a product in the market is when it is launched and is 
first available. The uncertainty that is associated with this can make this 
stage difficult for all involved.</p>
<h2><a name="inn"></a>Innovation</h2>
<p>New and innovative products can be problematic when the value is not clear to 
target customers. Such situations require marketing that explains and 
illustrates how the product works and shows how it adds desirable value. Showing 
the product in use, offering tuition of some kind and having customers praise 
its value may all be important. </p>
<p>Innovations are often covered by patents, copyright and other protection from 
copying. This not only helps keep competition away -- it may also be used to 
highlight the innovative nature of the product.</p>
<p>Many people fear buying innovative products which may become unfashionable 
and leading to ridicule from their friends. Fear of the product failing or 
lacking due support can also be dissuasive. Marketing plans should of course 
consider and address such customer fears.</p>
<p>A way of making innovative products acceptable and even desirable is to 
position them as fashionable, effectively promising buyers that they will be 
admired by others and hence afforded greater social status. This can be helped 
with strong styling that makes the product look good as well as delivering on 
its functional promise.</p>
<p>Offerings which are less innovative and which are based on existing products 
are easier to understand but may be challenged by customers who want more. 
Competitors may also latch onto an apparent lack of originality, using this to 
contrastively promote their own innovations. Marketing of low-innovation 
products may need to indicate why they are as they are, for example in order to 
address specific customer requests or offering a new price point model.</p>
<p>At the lowest end of innovation, simple upgrades may be released directly to 
existing customers as fixes for known issues. Marketing here may be minimal with 
a simple focus on reinforcing the 'we care' message.</p>
<h2><a name="ear"></a>Early customers</h2>
<p><a href="../../communication/diffusion/innovators.htm">Innovators</a> and
<a href="../../communication/diffusion/earlier_adopters.htm">Earlier Adopters</a> 
like exploring and trying out new products and may well make up a significant 
part of the early customer base.</p>
<p>These people are hugely important and need to be wooed carefully as they are ambassadors for your offering. If they hate it (or grow to hate you) then they 
can easily kill what could be a great success.</p>
<p>Innovators tend to have specific places they look for new products, such as 
high-tech exhibitions and specialist magazines and websites. A good review in a 
key journal or blog can spell life or death for a new product.</p>
<p>Early adopters seek advantage and look to innovators for inspiration. If they 
can see value they usually have a budget to buy whatever might help them out. By 
definition they are also disloyal and will dump your product for a better 
alternative.</p>
<h2><a name="cos"></a>Cost and price</h2>
<p>New products are often very expensive to develop and produce. Physical 
products required design and manufacture, including the setup of new production 
lines. At lower volume, manufacturing costs will remain high before economies of 
scale can be achieved. Software products scale easily but often take many months 
of development. Service products also have high early costs when they require 
hiring and setting up of delivery and response teams.</p>
<p>As a result, at product introduction there is often already a significant 
sunk cost that must be recovered before any profit is made. To this is added 
marketing costs that are necessarily high in order to reach new customers, beat 
competitors and create a buzz that makes the product more socially attractive.</p>
<p>Determining price is a difficult process as you both want good sales and yet 
start to recoup costs incurred. Customers sadly do not care about your costs, so 
positioning the product as offering new value or fashionable desire can be very 
important in order to justify higher initial prices.</p>
<p>Against the high-price approach is the argument for low prices which help 
gain rapid market penetration as well as locking competitors out for longer. If 
you go for low-price, rapid deployment, it is important that other parts of the 
company can keep up, including manufacturing and service. A further strategy is 
to create a managed scarcity that encourages desirability and buzz ('The product 
is so popular we can't keep up with demand').</p>
<h2><a name="com"></a>Competition</h2>
<p>If the product is in a competitive marketplace or is targeting new customers 
then the levels of competition will be high and the marketing will include 
positioning against competing products and brands. This should take account of 
switching costs, both monetary and emotional.</p>
<p>Loyalty may well be an important factor and new products may be released with 
a key purpose of keeping existing customers. It may also be possible to woo away 
the customers of competitors, whose consequent response may also require 
consideration.</p>
<p>One of the good points when introducing a highly innovative product is that 
there are likely to be few, if any, competitors. If the product takes off this 
will change, so it is important to take advantage of such 'undefended hills' to 
establish the product and brand in a strong leadership position.</p>
<h2><a name="lau"></a>Launch</h2>
<p>New markets are particularly difficult when products are innovative and 
potential customers are not aware of them or do not realize their value. This typically requires 
marketing that includes demonstration, trials and stories of realization and 
delight. Free trials, samples and even full products can help grow the market 
towards the more profitable future stages. </p>
<p>A big question in market budgeting is the balance between a big-bang launch 
and ongoing marketing activities. A big launch can be very useful, but if it 
leaves no money for further activity, it can create a skyrocket product that 
quickly goes up, selling well in the short term, but then turns over and comes 
crashing back down again.</p>
<p>This is not cheap and early marketing can be frustrating as all the cost and 
effort only results in relatively few new customers being gained.</p>
<p>An important part of launch is positioning. In this, the product may need to 
be positioned in several ways, including in alignment with customer needs, 
against competitor products, and within one's own portfolio.</p>
<p>After launch, customer and commentator reactions need to be tracked 
carefully. If there are serious problems, the product may need to be 
repositioned, re-launched or simply removed from the marketplace in order to cut 
losses and restore reputation. This can be a very difficult decision as managers 
often have strong emotional attachments to their products. It is also true that, 
with sufficient persistence, product could yet take off.</p>
