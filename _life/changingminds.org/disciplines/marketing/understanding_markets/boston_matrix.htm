<h2><a name="des"></a>Description</h2>
<p>The Boston Matrix is a method for classifying products based on their current 
value (as measured by market share) and future value (as measured by market 
growth), which is why it is also called the Growth/Share Matrix.</p>
<p>There are two ways to increase revenue: increase market share or sustain 
market share in a growing market. Both market share and market growth are hence 
important measures.</p>
<p>The matrix is often shown as a 2x2 grid, as below, but can be plotted on 
scale graph where actual measurements are used rather than qualitative 
assessments. </p>
<p>The 'market share' axis usually has 'low' on the right, rather 
than the left.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To use the Boston Matrix:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Determine exactly how the scales will be measured (see below for more on 
	this).</li>
	<li>Take each product or product line and place it on the graph. If possible 
	this is an exact position. If not, then assign it to one quadrant. </li>
	<li>Rather than a simple 'X', the size of the product revenue or profit can 
	be indicated with a proportionately-sized circle (this is not always done 
	but can be useful).</li>
	<li>Decide what actions are needed for each product or product line.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ideally, there should be a balance of stars in rising markets and and cash 
cows in mature markets (which are used to fund development of the stars and 
question marks). </p>
<p>In other words, the matrix can help develop a balanced portfolio of products.</p>
<p>In different markets there may be different customers and different 
competitors, with different market dynamics. Consequently, where products are 
being sold into different markets, then a different Boston Matrix should be 
completed for each market. </p>
<h2><a name="sha"></a>Market share</h2>
<p>Market share is a measure of present value to the company in terms of revenue 
and profit gained.</p>
<p>If economies of scale can be gained, then higher market share in a larger 
market also means higher profits per sale, making market share a non-linear 
scale in terms of profit.</p>
<p>Economies of scale are not only about the price of materials. Marketing costs 
can decrease greatly when there are less or weaker competitors, when your 
products are well-known, and when there is significant repeat purchase and 
recommendation.</p>
<p>Market share can be measured in several ways, for example measuring units 
sold or total revenue, as compared with all competitors or the largest 
competitor. This is often shown as a percentage. </p>
<h2><a name="gro"></a>Market growth</h2>
<p>Market growth is a measure of future value to the company in terms of the 
trajectory towards a larger market. </p>
<p>Even if the market share does not increase, a larger market can give scope 
for increasing sales.&nbsp; The ideal, of course, is to gain an increasing share 
within a rapidly growing market.</p>
<p>Surviving and thriving in growing markets can be an expensive business, both 
in the cost of reaching new target customers and the competitive situation as 
other companies also fight for this new territory.</p>
<p>Markets do not grow forever. When they reach saturation, new customer become 
rare and sales are mostly re-purchases. In this relatively stable state, 
increasing market share becomes more difficult and it can even be better to 
accept one's share rather than invoke a competitive war. </p>
<p>When markets shrink, their growth rate become negative. This is not always 
shown in the Boston Matrix, but may be worth including.</p>
<p>Market growth can be measured in terms of increasing potential customers, new 
customers, greater acceptance of new products and so on.</p>
<p>When does a market become 'high growth'? This depends on the industry. In 
many industries growth of greater than 10% per year is high. In technology and 
fashion domains, growth of 100% may be considered low. </p>
<h2><a name="dog"></a>Dogs</h2>
<p>Dogs are products where both market share is low and market growth is also 
low. </p>
<p>Should you 'let sleeping dogs lie' or terminate them? For streamlining and 
simplification it would seem logical to just get rid of Dogs. Yet if they incur 
low costs and give high profit per sale, then they may be worth keeping. </p>
<p>There may be other reasons for keeping Dogs, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>They are important to a major customer who spends a lot in other areas.</li>
	<li>They are a part of a 'complete' product line.</li>
	<li>There is potential to increase market share for them.</li>
	<li>There is potential for the market to grow.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="cas"></a>Cash Cows</h2>
<p>Cash Cows are the profitable products where a good market share is combined 
with a stable market that needs only a limited amount of marketing and product 
development to sustain a strong revenue stream.</p>
<p>Cash Cows are a major source of funding for other products and the funds 
created may be used to develop new products and grow market share in order to 
create the Cash Cows of the future.</p>
<p>There is a trap with Cash Cows where a company keeps these profitable 
products but does not use the profit from them to develop new products or grow 
market share of other offerings. In this way, marketing and development costs 
can apparently be kept very low. The result is that the company is very profitable for a 
while, but when the market fades or competition increases, the company does not have the 
ability or newer products with which to compete and its survival may even be 
threatened.</p>
<p>Another problem is that when markets fade and Cash Cows slip into becoming 
Dogs, their past glory continues within the company. The firm may be loathe to 
kill off the old Dog and may yet pump large amounts of money into attempts to 
revive it, further weakening their market position.</p>
<h2><a name="sta"></a>Stars</h2>
<p>Stars are the exciting and promising new products that are getting a lot of 
attention. A fast-growing market, coupled with a strong share of that market, 
makes these interesting both for customers and for the company.</p>
<p>The only problem with Stars is that they usually consume a lot of time, money 
and other resources, which can be to the detriment of other products. As a 
result of this, although many are being sold, the product may not yet be 
independently profitable.</p>
<p>A growing market does not necessarily mean a big market and it is possible to 
have Stars where there are not that many being sold. A critical question is how 
large the market is going to become. Some markets do grow significantly, yet 
others remain small. While being a big fish is nice, if the pond is small, the 
potential also may be very limited. For reasons such as this, sometimes it is better not 
to invest in Stars.</p>
<p>The goal with many Stars is to convert them into Cash Cows as the market 
stabilizes. If the market is going to become large enough and stable enough, 
then it can be worth investing significantly in Stars to keep their leading 
position and shut out serious competitors.</p>
<h2><a name="mar"></a>Question Marks</h2>
<p>As the name implies, Question Marks are perhaps the most difficult of all 
categories to manage. They are in high growth markets, which is promising, yet 
they only have a small share of that market.</p>
<p>Question Marks do not stay that way. They either become Stars and then Cash 
Cows or they slips back to become Dogs. </p>
<p>The question for Question Marks is whether it is worth putting money 
into marketing them to increase market share. The next questions are about how much 
further the market will grow and the realistic chances of growing share within 
this.</p>
<p>Question Marks are also known as <i>Problem Children</i>. This terminology 
illustrates well how personally products are perceived within a company, and the 
dilemma of difficult decisions that may have to be made about them.</p>
<h2><a name="dis"></a>Discussion</h2>
<p>The Boston Matrix was created by Bruce Henderson for the Boston Consulting 
Group in 1970 and is one of the classic marketing tools.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the reasons this matrix has become popular is the use of novel 
and memorable names for the quadrants. </p>
<p>No model is perfect and the Boston Matrix has received its share of criticism 
about the underlying assumptions and the general applicability of the model. As 
with any model, it should be used intelligently with an understanding of how 
well or not it fits its intended use.</p>
<p>The Boston Matrix is also known as the <i>Boston Consulting Group Matrix, BCG 
Matrix, Growth/Share Matrix, Boston Box, B-Box, BCG Analysis </i>or<i> Portfolio 
diagram</i></p>
