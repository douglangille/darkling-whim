<p class="smaller" align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Entering an existing market is not always easy as there may be significant 
barriers that can make it more difficult for new competitors to set up and sell 
into the market. </p>
<p>Porter (1979) describes six major sources of entry barrier:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Economies of scale</li>
	<li>Product differentiation</li>
	<li>Capital requirements</li>
	<li>Cost disadvantages independent of size</li>
	<li>Access to distribution channels</li>
	<li>Government policy</li>
</ul>
<p>Porter (2008) adds:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Demand-side benefits</li>
	<li>Customer switching costs</li>
	<li>Expected retaliation</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="eco"></a>Economies of scale</h2>
<p>As a company grows, not all costs increase with it, and some may even go 
down. Incumbent companies who have economies of scale can hence have a 
significant cost advantage over new entrants and smaller competitors.</p>
<p>Economies of scale can be demand-side or supply-side and may be found in the 
cost of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Original research</li>
	<li>Raw materials</li>
	<li>Manufacturing and production</li>
	<li>Marketing to larger audiences</li>
	<li>Shipments and logistics</li>
	<li>Service and support</li>
	<li>Attracting talented personnel</li>
</ul>
<p>Overcoming economies of scale requires innovation and bold moves, such as 
devising lower-cost manufacturing methods or sourcing overseas.</p>
<p>In practice, economies of scale are often not as significant as they may 
appear, as the costs associated with their increasing complexity can 
significantly offset any reduction in prices paid.</p>
<h2><a name="pro"></a>Product differentiation</h2>
<p>When a brand is well-established, it is known to many in the market, and 
customer loyalty is more common. This leads to lower costs and hence greater 
profits.</p>
<p>Products which are different to others stand out and are the natural choice 
for those customers who seek what these products offer.</p>
<p>With such differentiation and sufficient demand, companies have the choice of 
charging higher prices or increasing sales through lower prices. </p>
<p>Lower prices, which is also a part of how a brand is differentiated, acts as 
a significant barrier. If you cannot make a product that is any better than one 
which is currently sold for the price that it is sold at, then entering this 
market will be very difficult.</p>
<p>Overcoming product differentiation barriers often needs strong innovation to 
create products that leapfrog existing competitor offerings in terms of both 
functionality and cost. The latter may be achieved through approaches such as 
parts reduction and assembly simplification.</p>
<h2><a name="cap"></a>Capital requirements</h2>
<p>Some industries require significant investment in setting up and operating. 
Manufacturing, for example, can require large factories and specialist machines. 
Service also can be costly to set up, for example where a large number of 
service personnel needs to be recruited, trained and equipped.</p>
<p>High capital costs are typical when setting up for the first time. There may 
also be ongoing capital investments required, for example to cope with rapid 
changes in technology. Other capital costs include parts inventories, customer 
credit, and various other start-up losses.</p>
<p>Big and cash-rich companies are able to make a large capital investment 
required, or may be able to raise the funds elsewhere. Even so, this may require 
careful analysis that could result in a non-entry decision.&nbsp; For smaller 
companies, capital requirements can be a significant barrier.</p>
<p>Overcoming capital requirements may be achieved by starting small and growing 
organically, from profit, rather than seeking large loans. When rapid growth is 
essential, this is a less valid approach and collaborative options such as 
partnering or licensing may be preferable.</p>
<p>When there is rapid change in the industry, with such as the need to replace 
out of date machinery, and incumbents are slow to made needed investments, then 
this can play to the advantage of new entrants.</p>
<h2><a name="cos"></a>Cost disadvantages</h2>
<p>As well as capital costs there are all kinds of other types of cost that can 
give incumbents an advantage and new entrants a headache. These are often 
independent of the size of the company and can hence give smaller firms a big 
advantage over new-entrant large companies.</p>
<p>Such additional costs/advantages may include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The learning/experience curve gained from trying different things in the 
	marketplace.</li>
	<li>The sheer extent of how much knowledge is required to operate in the 
	market, and the accessibility of this.</li>
	<li>Proprietary technology that cannot be copied.</li>
	<li>Preferential access to limited supplies of materials and parts.</li>
	<li>Assets bought when they were much cheaper.</li>
	<li>Advantageous locations, from shopping mall positions to being close to 
	customers.</li>
	<li>Government subsidies and other national benefits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overcoming cost disadvantages depends on the size of the cost. One way to 
help with this is to leverage experience and benefits from an already-successful marketplace 
elsewhere.</p>
<p>Porter notes the importance of the experience curve and differentiates it 
from the learning curve (gaining skill through simple repetition). Where the 
rules of doing business are unwritten and different to other markets, then the 
only way to learn may be through a persistent cycle of trial and failure. Those 
who have made this journey may jealously guard marketing secrets to help sustain 
this barrier to entry.</p>
<h2><a name="acc"></a>Access to distribution channels</h2>
<p>If you have products which you produce and distribute, and particularly if 
these channels are held by relatively few players, then you may have difficulty 
in connecting with these partners or suppliers.</p>
<p>It is also possible in developing economies that such channels simply do not 
exist or cannot be trusted to reliably and safely store and transport goods. </p>
<p>One way of overcoming a lack of access to distribution channels is to set up 
your own. This can be very expensive, but it may provide you with a period of 
advantage during which you can establish your market position.</p>
<h2><a name="gov"></a>Government policy</h2>
<p>Governments in developing economies (and developed economies, for that 
matter) have a difficult task in both helping their own fledgling industries to 
develop while also encouraging foreign companies to set up locally. Inward 
investment helps by . creating more jobs and injecting investment into the wider economy. </p>
<p>As a barrier, governments may support local firms to the extent that new 
entrants find it much harder to find a profitable entry to the market. Local 
regulations may have subtle bias while other controls may blatantly limit new 
entrants.</p>
<p>Despite the need to support local firms, governments, especially in developed 
economies, like competition as it improves products for consumers and generally 
strengthens the economy. </p>
<p>Not all governments are uncorrupted and in some countries getting permissions 
is based more on bribery than law. </p>
<p>Governments may also be weak in some areas, for example in protection of 
intellectual property. In such cases companies with strong IP advantages may 
choose not to enter a local market where unfettered coping would be rife. </p>
<p>When the general law is weak, contracts may not be worth the paper they are 
written on when suppliers and others can ignore agreements with you at will. 
Again, this can make market entry more problematic.</p>
<p>Overcoming government blockages often needs one's own government to be 
involved in such as trade agreements and equalization around standards.</p>

<h2><a name="dem"></a>Demand-side benefits</h2>
<p>Porter (2008) talks about 'demand-side benefits of scale', or 'network 
effects' as being where a buyer's willingness to pay increases with that of other 
buyers. </p>
<p>This is a characteristic of
<a href="../../communication/diffusion/early_adopters.htm">early adopters</a> 
who tend to act as a herd. These people fear going first and being left with 
'a turkey'. They also fear being left behind and when sufficient others start to 
buy they all pile in together and the market takes off.</p>
<p>Overcoming demand-side benefits of competitors can be a slow business that 
includes not only showing your product as superior but also promoting the 
stability of the firm and highlighting the popularity of the product.</p>
<h2><a name="cus"></a>Customer switching costs</h2>
<p>When customers join a bank a lot of their transactions are automated, making 
it difficult to leave and join another bank. Such 'lock-in' systems make it more 
difficult for them to leave one supplier and move to another.</p>
<p>Switching costs can be financial, where moving has a distinct cost. These can 
also be legal, for example where a contract ties you to a fixed period.</p>
<p>Customers' motivation to switch can depend on a number of factors including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Their dissatisfaction or frustration with the current supplier.</li>
	<li>The importance of the product or service involved.</li>
	<li>The financial cost of switching.</li>
	<li>The time and hassle involved in switching.</li>
	<li>The attractiveness of alternatives.</li>
</ul>
<p>A way of overcoming switching costs from competitors is to do much of the work for customers, 
making it 'hassle-free'. Another way is by compensating them for any financial 
loss, although there must be a good expectation that this outlay cost will soon 
be recouped.</p>
<h2><a name="ret"></a>Expected retaliation</h2>
<p>If new entrants to a marketplace are treated seriously by existing firms, 
they may find themselves under attack by these incumbents. </p>
<p>Factors that make retaliation a serious issue for market entrants include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The size of competitors and their ability to attack.</li>
	<li>The extent and duration of the retaliation.</li>
	<li>The number of competitors who retaliate.</li>
	<li>The ability of competitors to control access to resources, key suppliers 
	and market channels.</li>
	<li>Bias in governments or local bodies towards supporting existing 
	incumbents.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before this happens, when analyzing the market, the <i>expected</i> 
retaliation increases with:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The impact you will likely have on incumbents' business, for example by 
	taking significant share in a static market.</li>
	<li>The resources incumbents have that they could use to retaliate.</li>
	<li>The history of retaliation by incumbents.</li>
	<li>The likelihood of damaging competitive actions, including loss-making 
	price cuts. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="dis"></a>Discussion</h2>
<p>Barrier generally operate on the principle of <i>asymmetry</i>, where 
different companies have different assets, capabilities, access and so on. If 
all companies were symmetrical, then there would be nothing to choose between 
them and competition would not exist. Barriers are hence essential in creating 
markets. There are similar considerations about
<a href="../../warfare/articles/symmetry_war.htm">symmetry in war</a>, from 
which compensatory strategies may be borrowed.</p>
<p>Barriers become dysfunctional when they are so high that market incumbents 
can keep out virtually all competitors and so have an effective monopoly (only 
one organization serving a market) or 
oligopoly (only a few all-powerful companies). The result is that they have significant power over consumers (and 
perhaps even governments) and can charge high prices for limited-quality goods.</p>
<p>Depending on which side of the fence you are, this can be good or bad. When 
you are trading in, or creating, a market, then you need strong barriers to entry that 
dissuade others. If you are trying to enter, then lower barriers are better, 
though you still do not want many others to enter after you in a way that will 
end up making competition 
harder.</p>
