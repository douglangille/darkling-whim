<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Porter (1979, 2008) described five forces that act a company within an 
industry. More generally, this applies to any market. Any industry can contain 
multiple markets. Markets can also reach across industries.</p>
<p>This model is commonly shown as in the diagram below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../../../images/porter_five_forces.GIF" width="374" height="344"></p>
<p align="center">
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="riv"></a>1. Competitive rivalry among existing competitors</h2>
<p>When you are selling something, there are others who want to sell something 
similar to the same customers. This leads to direct competition where multiple 
suppliers vie for the custom of each potential customer.</p>
<p>Competition can take many forms. In the first instance, it involves trying 
to persuade potential customers that you have a product that they need and that 
your offering is better than the other choices that the customer may perceive. 
The first form of competition is hence at the product level.</p>
<p>Beyond this, you may seek to show your company or brand as being superior in 
various ways, for example in having generally higher quality or being more 
stable and available into the future.&nbsp;The opposing brand or company may 
also be framed as being 'bad' in some way, from their ecological credentials to 
the reliability of their products. This is competing at the company or brand 
level. </p>
<p>Competition may hence focus on 'our product', 'their product', 'our brand' or 
'their brand' (and usually a combination of all four).</p>
<p>Rivalry and competitive action increases with:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Numbers of competitors.</li>
	<li>Oversupply of products as compared with demand.</li>
	<li>Sharp increase in capacity.</li>
	<li>Slow market growth that means business growth comes from stealing market 
	share.</li>
	<li>Dynamic, creative marketing in many competitors.</li>
	<li>Emotional commitment to growth and leadership within competitors.</li>
	<li>A blind commitment to strong competition even when it costs more than it 
	gains.</li>
	<li>High fixed costs and lower product costs that lead to temptations to cut 
	product price.</li>
	<li>Products that quickly date or are perishable that may also lead to 
	price-cutting.</li>
	<li>High exit barriers such as sunk costs that would be lost.</li>
	<li>Dumping of products at bargain prices and other self-destructive 
	actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mature markets often stabilize into a dynamic equilibrium where, although 
there is competition, most competitors survive over the long term. To achieve 
this, tacit oligopolistic tactics may be used, such as price alignment and an 
avoidance by all of price wars.</p>
<h2><a name="cus"></a>2. Bargaining power of customers</h2>
<p>Customers are not just passive recipients who pay whatever they are asked. If 
they think they can achieve it, then they will seek to bargain for a better 
deal.</p>
<p>Large customers can do this as an individual tactic, pressuring their 
suppliers into better deals. Customers often have the ultimate sanction of 
taking their business elsewhere, which gives them significant power. </p>
<p>Smaller customers have less ability to act this way, yet they may still band 
together into buying groups or may use the services of an aggregate purchaser.
</p>
<h2><a name="sup"></a>3. Bargaining power of suppliers</h2>
<p>Suppliers also may not be completely beholden to the company as they have 
something that the company needs. Their power is similar to employee power in 
that their ultimate sanction is withholding or total withdrawal. While few would 
do this, a degenerated relationship could lead to temptations to do so.</p>
<p>Suppliers are more powerful when:</p>
<ul>
	<li>What they supply is unique or difficult to find elsewhere.</li>
	<li>They have fewer competitors for your custom.</li>
	<li>You are a relatively minor customer for them.</li>
	<li>You are unable to cope if you run out of supplied items.</li>
	<li>They have viable alternatives if you remove your custom.</li>
	<li>They have few serious competitors for your business.</li>
	<li>There are high switching costs for you between suppliers.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, buyers are more powerful when:</p>
<ul>
	<li>They buy in large volumes.</li>
	<li>The items bought are relatively expensive.</li>
	<li>Their profits are lower (so they work hard at finding supply).</li>
	<li>Purchased items are standard and undifferentiated.</li>
	<li>They use more than one supplier for the same item.</li>
	<li>They represent a significant part of the supplier's business.</li>
	<li>They have the capability to produce the items themselves.</li>
	<li>Suppliers have spare capacity.</li>
	<li>Quality requirements are high (leading to inspections, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can replace suppliers easily then this reduces their power. However, even 
if you can find other suppliers, it can take time to get this organized.</p>
<p>When suppliers have limited ability to deliver, for example when raw 
materials or a key part becomes scarce, then they have to choose which of their 
customers to supply. This gives them further power is another reason to sustain 
your relationship with them.</p>
<p>Suppliers may also act as a group, collaborating to get the best for those in 
their industry. This can be helpful but may also lead to actions that make 
things more difficult for you.</p>
<h2><a name="ent"></a>4. Threat of new entrants</h2>
<p>At any time, new direct competitors may enter the market seeking to take 
customers away from both you and your current competitors.</p>
<p>The likelihood of there being new entrants into the market is affected by 
factors including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The existence and severity of <a href="barriers_entry.htm">Barriers to 
	Entry</a>.</li>
	<li>The <a href="market_attractiveness.htm">market attractiveness</a>, including potential profit or other benefits.</li>
	<li>New entrants have better economies of scale, newer technology, lower 
	cost structures, existing brand reputation or other differential advantages.</li>
	<li>Low switching costs for customers to move to new entrants.</li>
	<li>The lack of investment by current companies in the market.</li>
	<li>Regulatory changes that give new entrants advantages, including 
	de-regulation.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a market has been stable for some time, existing market 'competitors' 
can become lazy and set in their ways. A new entrant may compete in new ways 
that could be considered 'unfair' even though these are legal and effective. </p>
<h2><a name="sub"></a>5. Threat of substitutes</h2>
<p>One of the biggest sources of surprise in a marketplace is when a 
'competitor' appears with a product so different they are not seen as 
real competitor until it is too late. </p>
<p>A classic example of this is where the 
typewriter was substituted by the wordprocessor. At first, the wordprocessor was 
a very expensive system attached to a big computer and available to only a few, 
but with the advent of personal computer, the now-established method quickly 
killed the whole typewriter industry.</p>
<p>Incumbents may well try to fight substitutes with the same technology, but if 
they lack the whole competence to produce and sell these new products, then they 
will still fail.</p>
<p>There are two different types of substitute. The <i>full substitute</i> 
completely replaces the current product, making it redundant (as the 
wordprocessor did to the typewriter). The <i>partial substitute</i> acts as a 
new competitor but does not fully replace the original product. A classic 
example of this is margarine and butter. Butter has retained many customers as 
it has qualities that margarine does not have. Butter marketing has emphasized 
this and positioned margarine as a lower-quality substitute.</p>
<p>Substitutes can come from a wide range of products. The critical aspect of a 
substitute is that it is paid for with the same money that would be used for the 
item being replaced. Substitutes hence compete for 'share of wallet'. In this 
way, all beverages may be considered substitutes for one another. </p>
<p>Shifts in the wider marketplace and customer needs can lead to substitutes 
appearing, for example a 'health' concern leads to fruit juices and bottled 
water becoming substitutes for colas.</p>
<p>Substitutes are more likely when:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Buyers are open to alternative solutions.</li>
	<li>The substitute offers significant price benefits.</li>
	<li>Substitutes are seen to offer similar or better features.</li>
	<li>There are low switching costs for customers.</li>
	<li>There are other substitutes already available.</li>
	<li>Customers are dissatisfied with current offerings.</li>
	<li>It is easy to learn and communicate about substitutes.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with butter and margarine, substitutes may be of lower quality as long as 
they are good enough. In particular where price is important, a reduction in 
quality may be accepted when the reduction in price makes this worthwhile. Other 
disadvantages may also be acceptable, such as the delays in delivery associated 
with items source overseas. </p>
<h2><a name="dis"></a>Discussion</h2>
<p>Porter's model was created of of his doctoral work. Since then it has become 
a standard framework that is taught at many business schools and on most 
marketing courses. The main innovations it encompasses is in showing that (a) 
non-competitors within the current marketplace have power, and (b) there are 
additional threats beyond the status quo.</p>
<p>Other forces have since been identified, in particular Nalebuff and 
Brandenburger's <i>
complementor</i>. This is a product which does not compete. Instead it supports 
the company's offerings. <i>Essential complementors</i> are necessary additional 
products, for example paper is an essential complementor for printers. <i>
Non-essential complementors </i>are helpful but not necessary, for example 
decorative 'skins' for personal devices.</p>
