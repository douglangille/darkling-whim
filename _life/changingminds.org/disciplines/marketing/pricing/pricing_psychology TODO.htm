<h2><a name="exp"></a>Expectation</h2>
<p>Price has to take account of customer expectation, which is highly variable, 
depending on what customers have seen and heard. Advertising, competitors 
communications, hearsay and the promises you make all have an effect on what 
they consider to be an acceptable price.</p>
<p>Fairness is a particularly important concept. If they think you are taking 
advantage of them by charging well above your cost price, then many will not 
buy, just to 'punish' you, or otherwise demand a much greater discount.</p>
<h2><a name="bou"></a>Boundaries</h2>
<p>Why are things on sale priced at amounts such as 19.99 rather than 20.00? 
Even houses priced at hundreds of thousands are set at figures just below a 
natural rounded figure. </p>
<p>The reason for this is that we think in terms of boundaries. This is even 
more significant when an additional digit is added. If something is 100.00 it 
just seems much more than 99.99. This is why it can be better to price at 19 
rather than 19.99, especially if above the 19 you put 20.00 with a line through 
it.</p>
<p>Another reason why 19.99 sounds cheaper than 20.00 is the 'left digit 
effect', where we put extra weight on the first digit we meet, so in this case 
'1' is half of '2', helping to make 19.99 sound cheaper than ever.</p>
<h2><a name="pro"></a>Proximity</h2>
<p>There is a proximity effect around boundaries where people subconsciously or 
even consciously round to the boundary. Sometimes 19.99 is just too close, which 
is why 19.95 gets used quite often. Even 19.00 may be seen as close and 18.75 
might result in significantly more sales. </p>
<p>Proximity in time is also significant. If you show them an expensive item 
then a cheaper item, then the <a href="../../../principles/contrast.htm">
contrast effect</a> may well make the cheap item seem seem much better value. </p>
<h2><a name="rou"></a>Rounding</h2>
<p>Although we tend to use proximity, we also get used to sellers using this 
principle and consciously round off numbers to the nearest whole, ten or hundred 
value. This can make boundary strategies less effective.</p>
<p>For this reason, 16.00 can seem a 
lot more than 14.00. The reason for this is that we mentally tend to round 
off things even when they are not near a boundary, so 14.00 is closer to 10.00, while 16.00 is closer to 20.00.</p>
<h2><a name="anc"></a>Preferred numbers</h2>
<p>Why do you see things priced at 19.97 rather than 19.99 or 19.95? Or even 
priced at 19.77? </p>
<p>The simple reason for this is that if you gave a large group of people the 
choice of any number, a disproportionate set of people would choose seven. This 
pleasure at the number seven means people stick with it and are less likely to 
mentally round the number up to 20.00.</p>
<p>Seven has long been associated with magic and power. The reason that James 
Bond was assigned the number 007 is that in the sixteenth century, John Dee 
acted as a spy for queen Elizabeth the first of England. His number was also 
007, but written with the horizontal bar of the 7 protectively over the top of 
the 00, which represented the eyes of the queen. </p>
<p>In this way, if you put the price at a number with which people are happy or 
like for some reason, whether it is their door number or the age of their son, 
they will accept it more easily.</p>
<h2><a name="spe"></a>Specific prices</h2>
<p>Rather than pricing at 19.99 or 19.97, an effective alternative is to price 
at an odd amount such as 23.47. Why do this?</p>
<p>One reason is this works is that it is a bit harder work to round it off. A 
more significant effect is that when faced with a boundary-set figure such as 
19.99, people know that this is a deliberate ploy with which they are very 
familiar and probably quite cynical. So when they are faced with an odd number, 
they surmise that this is a 'real' price that has a direct connection with the 
original cost. In consequence they accept the anchor of the specific price.</p>
<p>Some supermarkets use this as a signal price, for example pricing sale items 
at 'X.94'. When customer realize this, they will often buy items priced in this 
way without checking if this really is a bargain or just a small reduction.</p>
<p>Prices that are an odd number are easier to increase, at least by small 
amounts, as customers are less likely to remember the original price (they may 
remember it as 'fifteen something' rather than 'fifteen' or 'about sixteen').</p>
<p>Janiszewski and Uy told subjects that the retail cost of an item was $4998, 
$5000 or $5012, and then asked them to estimate the wholesale price. Those who 
were told $5000 estimated a much higher price. They also found that house 
sellers who priced at an odd amount got a final offer much closer to their 
original price than those who set it at or near a round figure. </p>
<h2>Odd-number pricing</h2>
<p>Price an item with a final odd number, such as 19.99 or 19.97 rather than 
19.98. </p>
<p>This is related to the way that when asked for favoured numbers, people tend 
to odd number, most particularly 7, 5 and 3. Even numbers, it seems, have less 
arousal potential. They have even balance as they can be divided by two and so 
may seem 'calmer'. The imbalance of odd number, on the other hand, is more 
'interesting'.</p>
<h2><a name="sou"></a>Sound duration</h2>
<p>The longer it takes to say a sum, the greater the sum will seem to be. This 
can act against some of the principles above, for example 'nineteen-ninety-nine' 
takes far longer to say than 'twenty'. This is due to the size heuristic, where 
bigger names are taken as meaning bigger everything else.</p>
<p>This principle can be used when speaking sums, so rather than say 'one 
thousand, two hundred and fifty', instead say 'twelve-two-fifty'.</p>
<h2><a name="com"></a>Comma effect</h2>
<p>If you price something at '1,200' then people will usually read it as 'one 
thousand, two hundred'. If, however, you remove the comma ('1200'), then they 
will likely read it as simply twelve hundred'. This invokes the duration effect 
as 'one thousand two hundred' takes longer to say and hence seems more. It also 
uses the 'thousand' word, which is a word that makes things seem more than 
saying 'hundred' and is a barrier beyond which many will not go.</p>
<p>The general principle with high sums in the thousands is hence to remove the 
comma.</p>
<h2><a name="coi"></a>Easy Coinage</h2>
<p>The number and amount of coins and notes that we would pay for something also 
affects our perception. 20.00 is a single note and makes for a quick 
transaction. 16.25 would need more fiddling and handling of change. In 
situations where speed is important, such as grabbing a coffee, then a simple 
rounded figure may be better.</p>
<h2>Simple pricing</h2>
<p>Pricing an item at a price that is easy to pay, for example 20.00 makes it 
easier for the customer to pay with a single note or set of coins and reduces 
the hassle for them in handling change. It also sends a message that the store 
is being honest and not trying to deceive customers by pretending the product is 
cheaper by reducing it only by a small amount.</p>
<h2>Change</h2>
<p>Some stores deliberately price away from simple pricing so that change must 
be given. This increases the duration of the interaction with customers during 
which the relationships may be deepened. </p>
<p>Forcing change to be given also ensures that store attendants have to engage 
in the transaction and use till. This makes them less likely to quietly pocket 
the notes or coins handed over.</p>
<h2>Adaptive pricing</h2>
<p>Pricing can be varied to adapt to threats, opportunities and other situations 
where a simple change can increase sales, profit or both.</p>
<p>Pricing may be developed to adapt to situations, for example price-matching 
with competitors (many retail customers accept a 'price promise' without 
checking up).</p>
<p>Legends can build up around pricing techniques. For example a British store 
became known as pricing items with a four, such as 19.94 when they had been 
reduced. Customers noticed this and bought more at this price, so the store 
started pricing non-reduced items like this.</p>
