<p>Pricing is a tricky subject that can seem logical yet can be difficult to get 
right. Too high, and your sales may plummet. Too low and you may miss valuable 
profit. Prices also send messages, changing how you and your brand are 
perceived.</p>
<h2><a name="pur"></a>Pricing to a purpose</h2>
<p>One of the first questions when setting price is not so much how many 
products you are going to sell, but what you want to achieve. Do you want to 
achieve <a href="penetration_pricing.htm">market penetration</a>, pushing into a 
market and displacing other providers? Do you want to just make a quick profit,
<a href="price_skimming.htm">skimming</a> the market for maximum margin while 
you can? What <a href="signal_pricing.htm">signals</a> do you want to send to 
customers or competitors? When you know what you want want, then you can set 
your prices to help with this.</p>
<p>Common purposes when pricing include one or more of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Selling as many products as possible</li>
	<li>Making as much profit per product as possible</li>
	<li>Increasing your market share at the expense of competitors</li>
	<li>Driving competitors out of the marketplace</li>
	<li>Increasing the overall size of the market, encouraging new customers</li>
	<li>Establishing or confirming a luxury brand</li>
	<li>Getting rid of old stock, for example when you have a new product launch 
	coming up soon</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="thi"></a>Thinking like a customer</h2>
<p>When pricing, as with any marketing, it help a lot to understand something of 
how your customers think. Do you know how they buy? Is it habitual, impulsive or 
slow and thoughtful? Do they involve others in the purchase decision? Do they 
buy individual products or in bulk? </p>
<p>Other questions to understand include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>How sensitive to price are they? How would they buy if you reduced or 
	increased the price by a little? A lot?</li>
	<li>At what price would they think your product a bargain? Where would they 
	think it a rip-off?</li>
	<li>Do they recognize your brand? What do they think about it? How loyal are 
	they?</li>
	<li>Do they see your brand as high, medium or low quality? How does the 
	price affect this view?</li>
	<li>How do they view your competitors? What would lead them to buy competing 
	products?</li>
</ul>
<p>To get this level of information and particularly if you are not familiar 
with your customers, you can do pricing surveys, though beware that when 
customers say they will buy at a given price, this does not mean they really 
will buy, perhaps more that they would consider buying. The best way to 
understand customers is to look at real purchase data. If you can, do pricing 
experiments in contained markets. You can also do post-purchase (and 
post-non-purchase) interviews.</p>
<h2><a name="com"></a>Thinking like a competitor</h2>
<p>Remember always that your competitors will probably be watching your products 
and pricing (just as you should be watching theirs). If you price lower than 
their equivalent products, will they respond by cutting theirs too? Will they 
ignore your moves or will they react with a tiger response, attacking you on 
multiple fronts, from price to advertising to legal? When you are using
<a href="competitive_pricing.htm">competitive pricing</a>, you need to 
understand not only how customers will respond, but also how competitors will 
react.</p>
<p>Critical questions about competitors include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>What products of theirs compete with your products?</li>
	<li>How flexible are they on price? How far can they cut prices and still 
	make a profit?</li>
	<li>What is their standard discount structure? What does it take for them to 
	cut prices?</li>
	<li>How easily will they enter a price war? How fierce are they in 
	competing?</li>
</ul>
<p>Competitors may fear you, even if you fear them. They may also hardly think 
about you. We often imagine that competitor companies are hotbeds of innovation 
with infinite marketing budgets, all designed to ruin our day. Yet the truth may 
well be more mundane than we expect. Big companies mostly ignore small companies 
unless they are causing a particular problem. Small companies often think there 
is no way they can compete, especially on price, with larger companies. Yet it 
is in such misunderstanding that opportunities exist to outwit and out-price 
even bigger competitors.</p>
<h2><a name="hig"></a>Knowing when to price high</h2>
<p>Setting the price is not all making it as cheap as possible. Certainly, most 
customers want the price to be as low as possible. Yet there are times when you 
can successfully set prices higher. In fact setting the price high can be a very 
successful strategy, particularly in two situations.</p>
<p>A high price sends a signal that your product is of a high
<a href="price-quality_graph.htm">quality</a>. It says your products are 
exclusive, intended for people of taste who are powerful and rich enough to 
afford your price. In fact your products are so desirable the price is 
unimportant.</p>
<p>A high price may also be used when you have a <a href="captive_pricing.htm">
captive</a> market, who have little option but to buy from you. This is typical 
in a supplies and spares market, when they have bought the base product from you 
and now need to buy such as consumables, spare parts and maintenance from you. 
It is also typical in a monopoly, where you are the only supplier, or an 
oligopoly, where a group of suppliers all offer prices that are very similar.</p>
<h2><a name="cut"></a>Knowing when to cut prices</h2>
<p>It is one thing to set a price, but what if sales are not reaching target? Do 
you cut prices to get the volume up? Do you allow individual sales people to 
offer discounts?</p>
<p>Knowing when to cut prices is often a balance between having the courage to 
keep the price high and pricing to sell. Cutting the price can seem like an easy 
solution, yet when you do this, you send a message about the product and about 
future price cuts. Cutting the price significantly may say you have over-priced 
and have been rather greedy in adding too much profit margin. It may say the 
product is not as high quality as the original price indicated. Frequent price 
cuts may also lead customers to wait for the sales rather than buying when they 
might normally buy. There is nothing quite as annoying as buying a product and 
then find the price has later been reduced.</p>
