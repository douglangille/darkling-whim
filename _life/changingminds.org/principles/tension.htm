Tension principle</p>

<p class="smaller" align="center"><a href="#Principle">Principle</a> |
<a href="#How">How it works</a> | <a href="#so">So what</a></p>

<p class="smaller" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Principle"></a>Principle</h2>
<p>I will act to reduce the tension gaps I feel.</p>
<h2><a name="How"></a>How it works</h2>

<p>Tension is probably the fundamental driving force that moves us to change and
is at the heart of virtually all persuasion techniques. Think of the 'good
cop-bad cop' routine. What about all those retail displays that show you the
things you don't have? How about babies crying in a pitch that nature has tuned
to crawl up your spine?</p>

<h3>How it feels</h3>

<p>Tension is a feeling. Although usually internally sensed as an emotion, it actually <i>is
</i>physical tension, where your muscles tense
up involuntarily. It is uncomfortable and makes you want to do something to
reduce the tension.</p>

<p>Emotions that are felt as tension include:&nbsp; irritation, anger, fear, emptiness,
hunger,&nbsp; longing, wishing, discomfort, anticipation.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Between two things</h3>

<p>Tension happens between two things, like the hooks at either end of a
stretched rubber band, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What I have not got and what I want.</li>
  <li>What I like and what I do not like.</li>
  <li>What is good and what is bad.</li>
  <li>What I think of myself and what others think of me.</li>
  <li>What I do and what I believe I am.</li>
</ul>
<p>The creation of tension is thus the identification of two contrasting items
and the communication of this difference to the person being persuaded. It may
seem very simple, but this is the bare core of most persuasion methods.</p>

<h3>Present and future</h3>

<p>The most common things that cause tension in persuasive situations are based
in the present and in the future, whereby a given future is considered more
desirable than the present, and where the desirable future requires us to act to
change the continuation of the present. For example the action to change the
undesirable present of not having a car is to go out and buy one.</p>

<h3>Needs gap</h3>

<p>If I threaten you physically, I have created a gap for you between your deep
need for safety and the near-term future. Likewise if you tell me that you are
no longer going to be my friend, you have created an <a href="../explanations/needs/identity.htm">identity</a>
needs gap for me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As <a href="../explanations/needs/needs.htm">needs</a> are
deep-programmed things, they will often be the most powerful gaps and hence most
motivating. When there are many tension-creating gaps, needs gaps will take
precedence. Likewise when there are many needs gaps, then the deeper needs, such
as those lower in&nbsp; <a href="../explanations/needs/Maslow.htm">Maslow's Hierarchy</a>
will come first.</p>

<h3>Values gap</h3>

<p><a href="../explanations/values/values.htm">Values</a> provide us rules for
living that maintain our sense of personal integrity and allow us to live within
the shared rules of a group of other people. Values tell us what we should and
should not do, what is right and wrong, and what is more or less important.</p>

<p>When values are transgressed, we feel a sense of wrongness. If it is others
who have violated the values, then we feel righteous, superior and indignant.
When it is we who have wronged, then we feel shamed, guilty and fear the
retribution of others in the group.</p>

<p>As we are very socially driven, values gaps are very powerful and the tension
we feel may only be exceeded by that for needs gaps.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Goals gap</h3>

<p>We build our <a href="../explanations/motivation/goals.htm">goals</a>
as ways to achieve our needs. When we do not achieve goals as expected or seem
to be off-track on our way there, we feel frustrated and annoyed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The typical response to a goals gap is to redouble efforts, repeating what we
have done. For example most people, when confronted with a foreigner who does
not understand them, will repeat the same words, perhaps louder or slower. Only
when the 'do it again' approach does not work do we change the strategy or
tactics to achieve our goals. The frustration of the confused foreigner will
either drive us to blame him or her for stupidity and walk away or resort to
such as written diagrams or miming.</p>

<p>We will only revise our goals when we realize that there is very little
chance of us achieving them. Revising goals creates tension itself as it is an
admission of failure (and hence not meeting the need to&nbsp;<a href="../explanations/needs/win.htm">win</a>).</p>

<h3>Positive and negative</h3>
<p>Tension can be both positive and negative for us. There are
many ways we can be made to feel unpleasantly uncomfortable, but there are also
ways in which scariness can be pleasant, such as riding on
roller-coasters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The anticipation when queuing up to see a new movie or the
excitement of the story once we are inside are pleasant feelings. On the other
hand, there are many ways we can be made to feel&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is also possible to get positive and negative tension
mixed up. Many people hate roller-coasters, even though they know they are
perfectly safe. More hazardously, people can get stuck in damaging cycles, such
as battered wives who become addicted to the abuse of their husbands (who are
often also psychologically locked into the damaging behavioral pattern).</p>

<h3>Relevant and distraction</h3>
<p>When you want to persuade of something, there are tensions that relevant to 
the persuasion, both positive and negative, as above.</p>
<p>There are also distraction tensions that pull the person away from 
considering your point. This often appears as an attention issue and can be a 
big problem.</p>
<p>To manage tension in persuasion you need to increase positive tension while 
reducing both negative and dissuasive tensions.</p>
<h3>Achieving or avoiding</h3>

<p>We respond in two ways to tension, depending on how we view the two factors
that are creating the tension. If we focus more strongly on a desirable future
then this will <i>pull </i>us towards it as we seek to achieve that future. On
the other hand, if we focus first on the undesirable present, they this has the
effect to <i>push </i>us away from it as we seek to avoid a future where the
discomfort remains.</p>

<h3>Satisficing</h3>

<p>If the tension is strong enough, we will not search for the
best solution, we will simply grab at the first one that comes along that will
do the job, even if there may be better solutions out there. This is called <a href="../explanations/theories/satisficing.htm">satisficing</a>.</p>

<h3>Emotion</h3>
<p>What happens in the brain during tension? It depends whether 
we are tensed by desire or more negative
<a href="../explanations/emotions/emotions.htm">emotions</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../explanations/brain/brain_chemistry/dopamine.htm">
Dopamine</a> is traditionally associated with happiness, though in fact it has 
more to do with desire than satisfaction. Stimulating dopamine production hence 
creates tension. </p>
<p>
<a href="../explanations/brain/brain_chemistry/epinephrine.htm">Epinephrine</a> 
(or, as it is commonly called, adrenaline) is produced in the
<a href="../explanations/brain/fight_flight.htm">fight-or-flight reaction</a> as 
it prepares us for battle or running away.
<a href="../explanations/emotions/anger.htm">Anger</a> and
<a href="../explanations/emotions/fear.htm">fear</a> are emotions associated 
with these responses.</p>
<p>Other tensive emotions include 
<a href="../explanations/emotions/anticipation.htm">
	anticipation</a>, <a href="../explanations/emotions/greed.htm">greed</a>, 
<a href="../explanations/emotions/hope.htm">hope</a>, 
  <a href="../explanations/emotions/envy.htm">envy</a>,
  <a href="../explanations/theories/love.htm">love</a>, 
<a href="../explanations/emotions/shame.htm">
  shame</a>, <a href="../explanations/emotions/repulsion.htm">repulsion</a>, 
<a href="../explanations/emotions/contentment.htm">
  contentment</a>, <a href="../explanations/emotions/anxiety.htm">anxiety</a>, 
<a href="../explanations/emotions/jealousy.htm">jealousy</a> and 
<a href="../explanations/emotions/contempt.htm">contempt</a>.</p>
<h3>Positive attraction</h3>

<p>Anticipation can be a powerful and exciting force and we look 
forward to expected moments of pleasure. In fact the anticipation can be more 
enjoyable than the actual experience--'It is better to travel hopefully than to 
arrive', as author Robert Louis Stephenson said.</p>
<h3>Urge</h3>
<p>There is a deep 
<a href="../explanations/motivation/urges.htm">urge</a> system within the brain 
that pressurizes us into important survival actions such as eating, fighting and 
sleeping. </p>
<p>When we feel these urges we feel the tension of needing to comply with the 
urge against any other desires, such as to stay up late or lose weight.</p>

<h1><a name="so"></a>So what?</h1>

<p>So once you have create sufficient <a href="../explanations/trust/trust.htm">trust</a>, build
the tension that will create movement. Find the two things that will create
tension, often around an uncomfortable present and a&nbsp; more desirable
future. Understand how, when and where the person will move and design your
tensions system to move them in the right direction.</p>
