## Executive Summary

Coaching and therapy are complementary but distinct disciplines. Coaching works with functional individuals to optimize performance and achieve specific goals, while therapy treats psychological distress and mental health conditions. The key distinction isn't past vs future focus—it's about baseline functionality, scope of practice, and whether clinical intervention is needed. Understanding these boundaries helps you choose the right support for yourself or recommend appropriate resources to others.

## Core Distinction

**Therapy** addresses psychological dysfunction, distress, and diagnosed mental health conditions through licensed clinical practice.

**Coaching** supports functional individuals in achieving goals, improving performance, and navigating transitions without treating pathology.

**The line blurs** when high-functioning people have clinical needs, or when therapy clients are simultaneously pursuing performance goals. Many people benefit from both—sequentially or concurrently.

## Nine Key Dimensions

### 1. Primary Goal

**Coaching**: Performance optimization, goal achievement, and unlocking potential  
**Therapy**: Treating distress, healing trauma, managing symptoms, promoting mental health  
**Common ground**: Both support adaptation, growth, and human flourishing

### 2. Scope of Practice

**Coaching**: Unregulated; no diagnosis or treatment of mental health conditions; refers out when pathology emerges  
**Therapy**: Licensed profession with legal authority to diagnose and treat mental health disorders (DSM-5/ICD-11)  
**Critical boundary**: Coaches who diagnose or treat clinical conditions practice outside their scope

### 3. Time Orientation

**Coaching**: Primarily future-focused (goals, vision, action plans)  
**Therapy**: Varies by modality—trauma work explores past, solution-focused and CBT are present/future-oriented  
**Archive oversimplification**: The "therapy = past / coaching = future" binary doesn't reflect modern therapeutic approaches

### 4. Client Baseline

**Coaching**: Assumes baseline functionality; client is capable but underperforming or stuck  
**Therapy**: Works with impairment, distress, or dysfunction that interferes with daily life  
**Assessment matters**: If someone presents as "stuck" but has underlying clinical depression, they need therapy first

### 5. Data Sources & Context

**Coaching**: Often incorporates 360-degree feedback, stakeholder input, organizational context  
**Therapy**: Primarily client-centered; may include family systems work or couples therapy  
**Archive accuracy**: Coaching's organizational embeddedness is a genuine distinction, especially for executive coaching

### 6. Dynamic & Approach

**Coaching**: Active, directive, accountability-focused; coach may challenge and push  
**Therapy**: Creates reflective, safe space; pace is client-directed; therapist follows client's process  
**Both use**: Powerful questioning, deep listening, and relational attunement

### 7. Location & Setting

**Coaching**: Often happens at work, in organizational contexts, or action-oriented environments  
**Therapy**: Typically in protected therapeutic space (office, telehealth) with confidentiality emphasis  
**Symbolic importance**: Setting signals the nature of the work

### 8. Ultimate Customer

**Coaching**: Often organization-funded with competing interests (individual vs company goals)  
**Therapy**: Always client-centered; therapist's loyalty is to client even when insurance-funded  
**Ethical tension**: Executive coaches navigate dual accountability; therapists don't

### 9. Intervention Depth

**Coaching**: Surface to moderate depth; uses "what works" pragmatically  
**Therapy**: Can go deep into trauma, attachment wounds, personality patterns, unconscious dynamics  
**Archive accuracy**: Therapy "pulls powerful levers and exposes dark difficulties"—this distinction holds

## When to Choose What

### Choose Coaching When:

- You're functional but not performing at your potential
- You have specific, achievable goals (career advancement, leadership development, work-life balance)
- You need accountability, structure, and strategic planning
- Environmental factors or skill gaps are the primary barriers
- You want to optimize performance or navigate a transition
- You need an external perspective on professional challenges

### Choose Therapy When:

- You're experiencing significant psychological distress or impairment
- You have symptoms of anxiety, depression, PTSD, or other mental health conditions
- Past trauma is affecting your current functioning
- You're struggling with relationships, identity, or life meaning in ways that cause suffering
- Symptoms persist despite environmental changes
- You need help processing grief, loss, or major life disruption
- Self-destructive patterns keep repeating despite your efforts

### Consider Both When:

- You're high-functioning professionally but processing trauma personally
- Career transitions trigger deeper identity or attachment issues
- Performance anxiety has clinical features (panic attacks, avoidance, rumination)
- You need therapy for mental health AND coaching for goal achievement
- Your organization offers coaching but you recognize clinical needs

### Red Flags Requiring Therapy (Not Coaching):

- Suicidal ideation or self-harm thoughts
- Substance abuse or addiction
- Eating disorders
- Psychosis or dissociation
- Severe depression or anxiety
- Relationship violence or abuse

## Practical Implications

### For Leaders & Managers

**Offer coaching when**: An employee is capable but needs development, perspective, or accountability  
**Suggest therapy when**: You observe performance issues coupled with mood changes, withdrawal, or distress  
**Never diagnose**: Say "I'm concerned about you" not "You seem depressed"  
**Provide options**: EAP, benefits coverage, flexible time for appointments  
**Respect boundaries**: Don't ask what happens in therapy; do support their use of resources

### For Individuals Seeking Support

**Self-assessment questions**:
1. Am I functional in most areas of my life?
2. Is my issue primarily about achieving goals or managing distress?
3. Do I need skill development or emotional healing?
4. Can I identify what's blocking me, or does it feel mysterious/overwhelming?

**Try coaching first if**: You're functional, goal-oriented, and need external accountability  
**Try therapy first if**: You're suffering, impaired, or have clinical symptoms  
**Trust your gut**: If coaching feels insufficient, explore therapy

### For Practitioners

**Coaches**: Develop strong referral networks; know your scope limits; get supervision  
**Therapists**: Respect that coaching serves different needs; don't pathologize goal-focused work  
**Both**: Some people need sequential or concurrent support from both disciplines

## Archive Evolution Notes

### What ChangingMinds Got Right (2002)

✓ **Organizational context matters**: Executive coaching's embeddedness in workplace dynamics is a genuine distinction  
✓ **Active vs reflective dynamics**: The pacing and directive style differences are real  
✓ **Development vs dysfunction focus**: This remains the clearest boundary  
✓ **Ultimate customer distinction**: The organizational funding dynamic creates ethical tensions unique to coaching

### What Needed Updating

✗ **Time orientation oversimplified**: Modern therapy (SFBT, ACT, CBT) is often future-focused; the binary doesn't hold  
✗ **Therapy's diversity underrepresented**: Archive emphasizes medical/psychiatric model but ignores humanistic, existential, and relational approaches  
✗ **Regulatory boundaries absent**: No mention of licensure, scope of practice, or legal/ethical distinctions  
✗ **Data sources binary questionable**: Many therapists work systemically; many coaches work one-on-one exclusively

### Archive's Organizational Bias

The ChangingMinds framework clearly describes **executive coaching** within organizational contexts. It's less accurate for:
- Life coaching (which is more client-funded and individually focused)
- Health/wellness coaching (which may work with chronic conditions)
- Career coaching (which blends individual and market context)

## Integration with Wisdom in Practice

This synthesis complements the broader wisdom framework in `Wisdom_in_Practice.md`:

- **Know your limits**: Recognizing when someone needs therapy vs coaching is wisdom
- **Appropriate referrals**: Part of professional maturity
- **Holding complexity**: Both/and thinking—someone can need both disciplines
- **Context matters**: Organizational vs individual, cultural vs universal
