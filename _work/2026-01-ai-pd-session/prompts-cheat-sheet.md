# Prompts Cheat Sheet - Quick Reference for Demo
**REVISED: Replaced Excel with Reverse Prompting**

---

## Demo 1: Research & Best Practices

### Prompt:
```
Find recent articles about administrative challenges for academic chairs in community colleges
```

### Follow-up (if shown):
- Click "Create a summary report"

### Teaching moment:
"Notice I said 'community colleges' not just 'higher education' - specificity matters."

## Demo 2: Email Clarity

### Original Email:
```
Subject: Program Planning Documentation Requirements

Dear Students,

This correspondence is to inform you that all students must complete and submit their Program Planning Forms (PPF) to the Academic Advising Office no later than Friday, January 10th, 2026, at 4:00 PM AST.

Failure to comply with this deadline will result in a registration hold being placed on your student account, thereby preventing you from accessing the course registration system for the upcoming semester. Students who do not submit their PPF in a timely manner will be required to meet with their academic advisor to discuss their academic trajectory and program requirements prior to the hold being removed.

The PPF can be accessed via the Student Portal under the "Academic Planning" tab. Should you encounter any technical difficulties or have questions regarding the completion of this form, please contact the Academic Advising Office during regular business hours (Monday-Friday, 8:30 AM - 4:30 PM).

Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.

Sincerely,
Academic Advising Office
```

### Prompt:
```
Rewrite this email for grade 8 reading level while keeping all important information and deadlines. Make it clear and friendly.
```

### Teaching moment:
"I told it grade 8 reading level, keep all info, make it friendly - three specific instructions."

## Demo 3: Reverse Prompting / Brainstorming

### Step 1 - Brain Dump:
```
I have an hour with faculty this afternoon to cover professional development. Here's what I'm thinking:
- Something about AI tools maybe
- Accessibility requirements changed
- New student success metrics we have to report on
- Somebody asked about rubric design last week
- Equity and inclusion training is mandatory this term
- Time management keeps coming up in complaints

Help me organize this into a coherent session plan.
```

### Step 2 - Request Questions:
```
Ask me smart one-at-a-time questions to help clarify what should be the focus for this session.
```

### Step 3 - Get Formatted Output (after answering questions):
```
Based on my answers, create a 60-minute session outline with timing, key points to cover, and a realistic agenda.
```

### Teaching moment:
"First two demos, I asked Copilot to find or rewrite something. This one? I'm using it to help me THINK."

### Privacy reminder:
"Notice I didn't mention student names, specific faculty complaints, or confidential issues. Keep it generic."

## Alternative Demo 3 Scenario (if needed)

### Meeting Notes Organization:
```
I just came out of a meeting about student retention. My notes are messy:
- Early alert system isn't working well
- Faculty don't know how to refer students
- Counselling is overwhelmed
- Something about peer mentoring program
- Budget concerns were mentioned
- Someone said we need data
- First-year students particularly at risk

Help me organize these notes and identify what needs follow-up action.
```

## Emergency Backup Prompts

**If primary prompts don't work well:**

**Research Alternative:**
```
What are the latest trends in community college administration and leadership development?
```

**Email Alternative:**
```
[Paste any generic email]
Make this clearer and more concise while keeping all key information.
```

**Brainstorming Alternative (if conversation doesn't flow):**
```
I need to plan a 60-minute PD session on [topic]. What are the key elements I should consider and what's a logical structure?
```

## Excel Help (Mentioned in Wrap-Up, Available in Blog)

**If someone asks about Excel:**
```
I have an Excel file with columns for Student Name, Course Code, Final Grade, and Attendance Percentage. I need to create a pivot table that shows me how many students in each course have grades below 60% AND attendance below 70%. Walk me through how to set this up.
```

"This will be in the blog post I'm publishing after this session, along with more examples."
