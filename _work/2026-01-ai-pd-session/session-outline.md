## Pre-Session Prep

- [ ] Browser open to Copilot Chat (copilot.microsoft.com)

- [ ] Have prompts ready in OneNote/Word doc for copy/paste
- [ ] **Critical reminder:** No confidential data, no student info, no internal docs
- [ ] Test all demos once before session

## Session Flow

### Minutes 0-5: The Setup

**Opening questions:**
- "Show of hands - who's seen the Copilot button in O365? Who's actually used it?"

**Set expectations:**
- "Quick important note: we're using the web-grounded version of Copilot today. That means it searches the internet to help you, but it also means we can't paste confidential information into it. I'll show you what works with this version and what you'd need a different tool for."
- "I'm not an AI expert. I'm just someone who's been experimenting for the past year. Today I want to show you four things that actually save me time."

---

### Minutes 5-10: Meeting Notes - What Works, What Doesn't

**The reality check:**
"First topic: summarizing meeting notes. Here's the thing - our web-grounded Copilot can't read your internal OneNote or Word docs directly."

**What you CAN do (DEMO):**
- Show finding a relevant higher ed article via Copilot
  - Prompt: "Find recent articles about administrative challenges for academic chairs in community colleges"
- Then: "Summarize the key points from this article that relate to time management"

**What you'd need a different tool for:**
"For your actual internal meeting notes, you'd want Claude or ChatGPT with the paid version where you can paste directly"

**Practical workaround:**
"Or you can type up the key points yourself and ask Copilot to help organize them"

---

### Minutes 10-15: Email Clarity - This Works Great

**The setup:**
"This one works perfectly with what we have. And it's probably the highest-value use case."

**DEMO (Live or prepared):**
1. Draft a generic student email
   - Example: "Draft an email telling students they need to complete their program planning forms by Friday or they can't register for next semester"
2. Show your draft - make it typical academic-ese
3. Prompt Copilot: "Rewrite this email for grade 8 reading level while keeping all important information and deadlines"
4. Compare side by side

**Key insight:**
"Notice it's clearer, shorter, and still has everything. And no student info went into this."

**Practical tip:**
"Draft generic versions in Copilot, then personalize with specific names/courses afterward"

---

### Minutes 15-20: Excel Help - Formulas and Strategies

**Connect to pain point:**
"How many of you get big PeopleSoft dumps and just... stare at them?"

**Reality check:**
"We can't paste actual student data into Copilot, but we CAN get help with Excel techniques"

**DEMO - Ask for help:**

**Example 1:**
- "How do I create a pivot table that shows enrollment counts by program and campus?"
- Show the explanation you get back

**Example 2:**
- "What's the Excel formula to calculate the average of a column but ignore blank cells?"
- Walk through the AVERAGEIF explanation

**Example 3:**
- "I have columns for student ID, program, GPA, and enrollment status. What's the best way to identify students with GPA below 2.0 who are full-time?"
- Show how it walks through the approach

**Be clear:**
"This isn't analyzing your actual data - it's teaching you how to analyze it yourself"

---

### Minutes 20-25: Brainstorming - Where Web-Grounding Shines

**The setup:**
"This is where web-grounded Copilot is actually better than some alternatives"

**DEMO - Bad vs Good Prompts:**

**Bad prompt:**
- "Give me professional development ideas for faculty"
- Show the generic results

**Good prompt:**
- "I'm presenting to community college academic chairs in Nova Scotia. They're overwhelmed with administrative tasks. What are three current best practices from higher education for helping chairs manage their workload? Focus on practical, implementable strategies."
- "See how it's pulling from actual current articles and resources?"

**Another example:**
- "Find recent discussions about using AI for administrative tasks in higher education. What are the common concerns and how are colleges addressing them?"

---

### Minutes 25-30: Q&A + Challenge + Reality Check

**Open for questions:**
"Questions about anything we just tried?"

**Address the elephant in the room:**
"I know some of you are thinking 'this seems limited compared to what we hear about AI.' You're right. Web-grounded means we're playing it safe with data privacy. For more advanced stuff with your actual internal data, you'd need the licensed add-ons or approved tools with proper data handling."

**The practical win:**
"But here's what you CAN do today with what we have: improve your writing, learn Excel techniques, research best practices, and brainstorm with current web resources. That's not nothing."

**The challenge:**
"Here's your homework: pick ONE of these four things. Try it once this week. Just once. See if it works for you."

**Close with positioning:**
"I'm not five years ahead of you on this. I'm five minutes ahead. The difference is I'm putting in the time to experiment within the boundaries we have."

**Offer to help:**
Drop your email in chat: "If you try something and want to talk through it, reach out"

## Safety Reminders to Emphasize Throughout

- ❌ Never paste student names, IDs, grades, or personal information
- ❌ Never paste confidential internal documents
- ✅ Draft generic versions, then add specific details manually afterward
- ✅ When in doubt, ask yourself "would I post this on Twitter?" - if not, don't put it in Copilot

## Backup Questions & Answers

**Q: "What about Copilot in Word/Outlook/Excel?"**
A: "Those require the licensed add-on that we don't have yet. Today we're using the standalone Copilot Chat which is available to everyone."

**Q: "Can I use this for grading/feedback?"**
A: "For generic rubric development or feedback templates, yes. For actual student work with names/grades, no - not with the web-grounded version."

**Q: "What if I want to do more?"**
A: "Talk to your department about approved tools with proper data handling. Claude, ChatGPT Plus, and others have education-specific licenses. But start with what we have and see if it's useful first."

**Q: "Is this going to replace us?"**
A: "It's a tool, like Excel or email. It changes how we work, but it doesn't eliminate the need for your expertise and judgment. Think of it as an assistant that never sleeps but needs constant supervision."
