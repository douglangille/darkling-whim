# Demo 3: Reverse Prompting / Brainstorming - Testing Notes

## Purpose
Test the reverse prompting technique before using it in tomorrow's session.

## The Technique (4 Steps)

### Step 1: Brain Dump
Dump messy, incomplete thoughts into Copilot.

### Step 2: Ask for Organization
Copilot structures and organizes the brain dump.

### Step 3: Request Clarifying Questions
Copilot asks smart one-at-a-time questions.

### Step 4: Answer and Get Formatted Output
Based on your answers, Copilot creates usable output.

## Test Scenario: PD Session Planning

### Prompt 1 (Brain Dump):
```
I have an hour with faculty this afternoon to cover professional development. Here's what I'm thinking:
- Something about AI tools maybe
- Accessibility requirements changed
- New student success metrics we have to report on
- Somebody asked about rubric design last week
- Equity and inclusion training is mandatory this term
- Time management keeps coming up in complaints

Help me organize this into a coherent session plan.
```

**Expected result:**
- Copilot groups related items
- Identifies themes
- Suggests priorities
- Points out what won't fit

---

### Prompt 2 (Request Questions):
```
Ask me smart one-at-a-time questions to help clarify what should be the focus for this session.
```

**Expected result:**
- Questions about urgency
- Questions about required vs. optional
- Questions about audience skill level
- Questions about time constraints

---

### Prompt 3 (After Answering - Get Output):
```
Based on my answers, create a 60-minute session outline with timing, key points to cover, and a realistic agenda.
```

**Expected result:**
- Structured agenda with time blocks
- Key talking points
- Realistic for 60 minutes
- Prioritized based on your answers

## Alternative Scenario: Meeting Notes Organization

### Prompt (Brain Dump):
```
I just came out of a meeting about student retention. My notes are messy:
- Early alert system isn't working well
- Faculty don't know how to refer students
- Counselling is overwhelmed
- Something about peer mentoring program
- Budget concerns were mentioned
- Someone said we need data
- First-year students particularly at risk

Help me organize these notes and identify what needs follow-up action.
```

**Expected result:**
- Organized by themes (systems, resources, data, specific populations)
- Identifies action items vs. discussion points
- Highlights what needs more information

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test PD planning scenario in demo account
- [ ] Verify Copilot organizes brain dump logically
- [ ] Confirm it asks relevant clarifying questions
- [ ] Check that final output is realistic and usable
- [ ] Test alternative meeting notes scenario if time
- [ ] Note any quirks or issues
- [ ] Prepare backup if Copilot doesn't ask questions (you ask it to elaborate instead)

## Demo Strategy

**If it works perfectly:**
- Show all 4 steps live
- Let them see the conversation unfold
- Emphasize the "thinking partner" aspect

**If Copilot doesn't ask questions automatically:**
- Adapt: "Let me ask it to help me think through priorities..."
- Still shows the conversational aspect
- Focus on the organizational value

**If it's clunky:**
- Have a screenshot of when it worked
- Walk through what happened: "When I tested this yesterday..."
- The concept is still valuable even if live demo is imperfect

## Why This Demo is High Value

**Broadly applicable:**
- Planning PD sessions
- Organizing meeting notes
- Developing ESP strategies
- Thinking through budget priorities
- Structuring course design
- Clarifying fuzzy problems

**Shows NEW capability:**
- Most people think AI = "ask question, get answer"
- This shows AI = "have conversation, think together"
- The "one-at-a-time questions" feature is surprising

**Differentiated from other demos:**
- Demo 1: AI finds information
- Demo 2: AI rewrites content
- Demo 3: AI helps you THINK

**Addresses Matt's original ask:**
- "Summarizing meeting notes" ✅
- "Brain dumps" ✅
- "Effective brainstorming" ✅
- "Reverse prompting" ✅ (you literally said this to Matt!)
