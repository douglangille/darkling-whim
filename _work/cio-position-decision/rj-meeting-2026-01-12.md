# Conversation Summary: R.J. Meeting (Jan 12, 2026)

## Key Points
- Neither R.J. nor I want the CIO role due to the administrative burden, logistical challenges, and the requirement to be Halifax-centered, which does not suit either of our situations.
- Both of us are concerned about Ange getting the CIO role. While we could tolerate her in a short-term capacity, a long-term appointment would be problematic.
- We estimate Derek's chances for the VP role at about 50-50. If he does not get it, he is likely to leave eventually, seeing it as a career setback.
- Stacey Bailey (current Director of Public Affairs) is seen as Anna's trusted confidant and likely the preferred candidate for the VP role.
- Anna is assumed to be the top candidate for the president role long-term, and this process may be more than just a formality.

## Next Steps
- R.J. and I ran out of time and will meet again (likely tomorrow) to continue the discussion.
- We agreed that both of us need to talk to Derek directly about his intentions and preferences, as we assume he wants one of us to apply for CIO, but neither of us is likely to do so. (Though R.J. might apply just to see if he could get it, but would likely turn it down for personal reasons unless it was a short-term gig.)
- If the CIO role becomes vacant, possible scenarios include:
    - Derek could become both VP and CIO (VP of Technology and College Services), though this would be a very broad portfolio.
    - The department could be run by a committee of senior managers (a virtual CIO model).
    - The organization could revert to having only a Director instead of a CIO.
- The only scenario where Derek might stay is if he does not get the VP role, but the VP is filled by an external candidate and he remains CIO.
- More discussion is needed to clarify intentions and possible outcomes.
