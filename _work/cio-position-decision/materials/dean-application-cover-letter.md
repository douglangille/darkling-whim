Dear Andrew Lafford,

Our recent conversation deepened my understanding of the critical priorities for the Dean, School of Technology and Environment role, particularly your concerns regarding comprehensive AI integration across all programs and the vital need to revitalize industry partnerships. With over 25 years of dedicated leadership within NSCC, I am uniquely positioned to address these challenges and drive the strategic evolution of the School. My strong grasp of both the 'gist' and 'gestalt' of how things work within an educational institution, coupled with my strategic vision and operational acumen, aligns directly with the impactful leadership this role demands.

My extensive career at NSCC has been rooted in operational IT leadership, yet it has consistently involved deep engagement with academic delivery and strategic decision-making. As a Regional IT Manager for Campus Operations for over two decades, I sat on Campus Management Teams at our largest campuses, providing an essential "IT lens" to discussions on academic strategy and operational issues alongside Academic Chairs and Principals. This direct, on-the-ground collaboration has given me a nuanced understanding of the student experience and the practical needs of faculty, enabling me to approach complex academic and operational challenges from a holistic, systems-thinking perspective.

I share your imperative for ensuring NSCC remains at the forefront of technological integration, especially with Artificial Intelligence. I have actively guided academic leaders and faculty in translating AI's impact across diverse sectors, including guest lecturing on AI's influence on communication skills in the Practical Nursing program, demonstrating a direct influence on curriculum. Furthermore, my leadership in developing College-wide AI policy and governance with the Centre for Teaching and Learning underscores my commitment to shaping institutional standards and fostering forward-thinking academic approaches beyond IT. This strategic, cross-disciplinary leadership is precisely what is needed to integrate AI meaningfully across the School of Technology and Environment's diverse programs.

I also recognize the critical importance of strengthening industry partnerships and the immediate need to rebuild Program Advisory Committees (PACs), particularly on the trades side of the School. My proven ability to build and leverage strategic external relationships, cultivated through partnerships with leading technology vendors like D2L, Dell and Microsoft, alongside engagement with Digital Nova Scotia, the Public Sector Network and other national PSE/IT strategic networks, provides a robust foundation. I am confident I can bring a fresh, systems-thinking approach to revitalize and establish new, impactful relationships that ensure our programs, including the critical new Mining Technician program, directly meet evolving provincial and industry needs.

My leadership extends to driving digital transformation, expertly managing diverse teams comprised of individuals from varied professional domains, and overseeing multi-million dollar budgets. I foster truly inclusive environments, building credibility and effectively communicating across all tiers and expertises within the institution. I have a long-standing commitment to addressing deep-seated operational and strategic challenges within the College's ecosystem, exemplified by my decades of involvement in providing vision and leadership for crucial academic environments like the N172/CCN sandbox. As an ardent futurist, I am passionate about leveraging this unique blend of operational insight, technological foresight, and academic understanding to lead the School of Technology and Environment into its next phase of innovation and excellence.

Andrew, while my professional journey may not align with the traditional academic path for a Dean, my 25 years of institution-wide, strategic IT leadership, coupled with direct influence on academic delivery and robust external engagement, offers precisely the non-traditional yet essential leadership required for this role. I believe my 'equivalent experience' is not merely a substitute, but a uniquely pragmatic and future-focused qualification for a Dean who must drive innovation and fortify critical industry connections in an increasingly technology-driven world. I am enthusiastic about this opportunity and eager to discuss my vision for the School of Technology and Environment with you further.

Sincerely,

Doug Langille
