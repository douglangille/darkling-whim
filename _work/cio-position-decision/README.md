## Key Context

### The Opportunity
Don Bureau (President) is leaving NSCC for Halifax Chamber of Commerce. Anna Burke becomes Acting President, creating VP College Services vacancy. Derek McCurdy interested in that role, which would open Acting CIO position.

### Doug's Position
- Manager of Digital Innovation, Staff Training & Development
- 26 years at NSCC (24 in IT operations)
- Currently 3 reports, would manage ~100 as CIO
- Strong relationship with Anna Burke
- Deep institutional knowledge

### Primary Candidates
- Doug Langille (you) - assessed as most suitable but doesn't actually want permanent CIO role
- Angela McCarthy - would not provide air cover for innovation work
- RJ Poirier - **only viable internal candidate Doug could work with; could provide air cover**

## Discovery Session & RJ Meeting Summary

### Discovery Session Completed: 2026-01-09, 8:56 PM - 10:06 PM AST
### RJ Meeting: 2026-01-12

+**Key New Insights from RJ Meeting and Personal Reflection:**
RJ has now firmly stated he does not want the CIO role, even temporarily. Doug has also decided not to pursue the CIO role under any scenario, due to personal logistics, lack of fulfillment, and negative impact on life and work—even as a defensive move. This removes the preferred "RJ as CIO, Doug as senior manager" scenario from consideration.
Both Doug and RJ remain concerned about Angela or an external candidate deprioritizing innovation work.
Derek’s move to VP is uncertain (50-50), but if he leaves, the CIO role will open. Anna is likely to become President, and Stacey Bailey is a strong candidate for VP.
It is now critical to clarify what Derek wants in a CIO, what he wants as VP College Services, and to understand Stacey Bailey’s and Anna’s vision for the future structure.
There is a possibility of a dark horse candidate emerging for either CIO or VP roles; remain agile and alert for unexpected developments.
It is also important to have a candid conversation with Angela to better understand her intentions and leadership approach as a potential CIO, as perceptions may not match her actual approach in a senior leadership context.
The focus is now on seeking a solution that protects innovation work and aligns with Doug's values, without sacrificing well-being.

### Core Insights Uncovered

**What Doug Actually Wants:**
- Create innovative programs and mentor great people
- Make real impact on learning
- Do creative/strategic skunkworks work
- Eventually: career coaching or "professional skunkworks for hire"

**What Doug Doesn't Want:**
- To BE a permanent CIO ("not sure being CIO would make me proud outside of status symbol")
- Implementation details grind
- Pure executive admin

**The Real Question:**
Not "Should I pursue CIO?" but rather "Given Derek is leaving anyway within 12 months, what's the best path to protect innovation work and position for ideal next role?"

**Critical Discovery:**
- Derek leaving regardless (won't stay if doesn't get VP role)
- New CIO inevitable within 12 months
- **RJ is ONLY internal candidate Doug can work with who would provide air cover**
- Angela would gut innovation work
- External hire is unknown variable

## Three Viable Scenarios

### Scenario A: Doug Becomes Acting CIO
✅ Protects innovation work (provides own air cover)  
✅ Proves capability (capstone/status achieved)  
✅ Executive experience and compensation  
❌ Gives up IC work he loves for 6-12 months  
❌ Doing job for status/duty, not fulfillment  
❌ Logistics challenges (one car, 45 min commute, RTO)  

### Scenario B: RJ Becomes CIO, Doug Takes RJ's Role ⭐ BEST OUTCOME
✅ RJ provides air cover for innovation work  
✅ Senior Manager of Service Delivery Operations = "best of both worlds"  
✅ More strategic/operational blend, less pure exec admin  
✅ Stays available for Dean or other creative senior roles  
✅ Better alignment with actual interests (mentoring, strategy, some IC work)  
❌ Requires RJ to want CIO (not yet confirmed)  

### Scenario C: Angela or External Gets CIO
❌ Innovation work likely gutted or deprioritized  
❌ Doug marginalized or packaged out  
❌ "Life would just suck so hard"  
❌ This is the scenario to AVOID  

## RECOMMENDATION

### Critical Next Step: ONE CONVERSATION DETERMINES EVERYTHING

**Have coffee with RJ within next 7 days to gauge his genuine interest in CIO role.**

That conversation determines the entire strategy:

**IF RJ wants CIO:**
- ✅ DON'T compete with him
- ✅ Support his candidacy
- ✅ Position for his senior manager role
- ✅ This is likely your BEST outcome

**IF RJ is ambivalent or doesn't want CIO:**
- ✅ DO pursue acting CIO yourself
- ✅ You become default internal candidate
- ✅ Frame as temporary transition leadership
- ✅ Prevents worst-case scenario

**IF Angela has strong executive support:**
- ✅ DO pursue CIO aggressively
- ✅ This becomes defensive move
- ✅ Rally stakeholders, position as continuity

+## Updated Next Steps (as of Jan 12, 2026)

1. RJ has confirmed he does not want the CIO role, even temporarily.
2. Doug has decided not to pursue the CIO role under any scenario, due to personal logistics, lack of fulfillment, and negative impact on life and work—even as a defensive move.
3. Have a direct conversation with Derek to clarify:
	- What he wants in a CIO
	- His own intentions as VP College Services
4. Quietly assess Stacey Bailey’s intentions and vision as likely VP College Services.
5. Quietly assess Anna’s vision for the future structure and succession.
6. Have a candid conversation with Angela to understand her intentions and leadership approach as a potential CIO.
7. Remain alert for the possibility of a dark horse candidate for either CIO or VP roles.
8. Seek a solution that protects innovation work and aligns with your values, without sacrificing your well-being.
9. Document all findings and decisions in the action plan and README.

## Decision Timeline

**Week of Jan 13-17**: Intelligence gathering (RJ, Derek, Anna, Angela assessment)  
**Week of Jan 20-24**: Make go/no-go decision based on RJ conversation results  
**Week of Jan 27+**: Execute chosen strategy (pursue CIO, support RJ, or defensive positioning)  

## The "Third Path" - Potential Best Outcome

**If RJ becomes CIO and Doug takes RJ's senior manager role:**

1. Innovation work protected under RJ's air cover ✅
2. Senior Manager of Service Delivery Operations (growth + better fit) ✅
3. Strategic/operational blend (more interesting than pure exec admin) ✅
4. Mentoring opportunities (managers reporting to him) ✅
5. Stays available for Dean or other creative senior roles ✅
6. Better work-life logistics ✅
7. Alignment with actual interests and retirement career vision ✅

**This might be "best of both worlds" - you get protection for innovation work without sacrificing what you actually love doing.**
