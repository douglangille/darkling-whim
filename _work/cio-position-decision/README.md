## Key Context

### The Opportunity
Don Bureau (President) is leaving NSCC for Halifax Chamber of Commerce. Anna Burke becomes Acting President, creating VP College Services vacancy. Derek McCurdy interested in that role, which would open Acting CIO position.

### Anna's EOI Process
Anna is creating an Expression of Interest rather than direct appointment. May be opening beyond direct reports - adding uncertainty to timeline and candidate pool. No applications submitted yet.

### Doug's Position
- Manager of Digital Innovation, Staff Training & Development
- 26 years at NSCC (24 in IT operations)
- Direct reports: Shelley Hire, Madison Fraser, Holly Stackhouse (Ed Tech Analysts)
- Strong relationship with Anna Burke
- Deep institutional knowledge

### Key Players

**Derek McCurdy (Current CIO)**
- Pursuing Acting VP College Services (50-50 odds per RJ)
- Expects either Doug or RJ to backfill CIO role
- **Does not yet know neither wants the position**
- Likely to leave eventually if doesn't get VP

**RJ Poirier (Senior Manager Service Delivery Operations)**
- Confirmed he does NOT want CIO role (even temporarily)
- Might apply "just to see" but would likely decline
- Personal/logistical reasons make it unworkable
- Only internal candidate Doug could work with

**Angela McCarthy (Sr Manager Core Infrastructure Services)**
- Reports to Derek, peer to RJ
- Back-of-house focus (infrastructure, operations)
- Blind spot: front-of-house/student-facing priorities
- Concern: would deprioritize innovation work

**Stacey Bailey (Director of Public Affairs)**
- Anna's friend and trusted confidant
- Long tenure at NSCC
- Likely preferred candidate for VP College Services
- If she gets VP, Derek probably doesn't

**Anna Burke (Acting President)**
- Current VP, becoming Acting President
- Close relationship with Stacey
- Creating formal EOI process for VP role

### Innovation Work at Risk

What needs protection:
- Classroom technology initiatives
- AI productivity work and AI tinkerspaces
- Emerging technology integration
- Makerspaces and learning innovation labs
- Esports programs
- D2L Brightspace tech stack and training
- All student-facing learning experience technology

**The Risk**: Angela or external candidate may not understand or prioritize "front of house" learning technology, focusing only on back-of-house infrastructure.

## Discovery Session & RJ Meeting Summary

### Discovery Session Completed: 2026-01-09, 8:56 PM - 10:06 PM AST
### RJ Meeting: 2026-01-12, 3:00 PM AST

**Key Insights from Both Sessions:**

**What Doug Actually Wants:**
- Create innovative programs and mentor great people
- Make real impact on learning
- Do creative/strategic skunkworks work
- Eventually: career coaching or "professional skunkworks for hire"

**What Doug Doesn't Want:**
- To BE a permanent CIO ("not sure being CIO would make me proud outside of status symbol")
- Implementation details grind
- Pure executive admin
- One-car household logistics with 45-min commute and RTO requirements

**Critical Decisions Made:**
1. ✅ Doug will NOT pursue CIO role under any scenario
2. ✅ RJ will NOT pursue CIO role (even temporarily)
3. ⚠️ Derek does NOT know this yet - expects one of them to apply
4. 🎯 Derek conversation is now CRITICAL - his VP decision may hinge on CIO succession confidence

**Alternative Scenarios Discussed:**
- Derek as dual VP/CIO (very broad portfolio)
- Virtual CIO model (committee of senior managers)
- Reversion to Director-level instead of CIO
- External candidate (unknown variable)

## THE CRITICAL REALIZATION

**Derek's expectation**: Either Doug or RJ will backfill CIO when he moves to VP

**The reality**: Neither wants the role

**The implication**: Derek's willingness to pursue VP could depend on knowing he's leaving CIO in capable, trusted hands. Discovering neither Doug nor RJ wants it could affect his decision calculus.

**The urgency**: This conversation needs to happen THIS WEEK before Derek gets too far into his own planning.

## Updated Strategy: Options A + B

### This Week (Before Friday)
**Action**: Meet with RJ again to align on Derek conversation
- Coordinate key talking points
- Agree on what to surface in respective conversations
- Align on messaging without being scripted
- Ensure both are ready to have candid discussions

### Friday (Meeting with Derek - Solo)
**Action**: Have preliminary conversation with Derek (RJ unavailable - collective bargaining)
- Surface his expectations for CIO succession
- Understand his vision and needs for successor
- Gauge reaction to neither Doug/RJ pursuing role
- Explore alternative structure scenarios
- Assess his confidence level in pursuing VP

### After Friday
**Action**: Debrief with RJ and reassess
- Share Derek's responses and reactions
- Determine implications for protecting innovation work
- Identify next steps based on new intelligence
- Update strategy accordingly

## Key Questions for Derek

When the moment is right in Friday's conversation:

1. **Succession confidence**: What does he need from his CIO successor to feel confident pursuing VP?
2. **Alternative structures**: Has he considered alternatives (virtual CIO, dual role, different org structure)?
3. **Innovation priorities**: How does he see innovation work being protected/prioritized under different scenarios?
4. **Candidate preferences**: Does he have views on potential candidates (Angela, external, other)?
5. **Realistic assessment**: What's his honest take on VP role odds and timeline?
6. **His contingency**: What if neither Doug nor RJ pursues CIO - what then?

## Three Scenarios (Still Relevant but Evolving)

### Scenario A: Doug Becomes Acting CIO
**Status**: Doug has decided NOT to pursue this
✅ Would protect innovation work  
❌ Logistics challenges, doing job for wrong reasons, not fulfilling

### Scenario B: RJ Becomes CIO, Doug Takes RJ's Role
**Status**: RJ has decided NOT to pursue CIO
✅ Would have been best outcome for innovation protection  
❌ Not viable - RJ won't do it

### Scenario C: Angela or External Gets CIO
**Status**: Most likely outcome now
❌ Innovation work likely deprioritized  
❌ Front-of-house blindspot risk  
🎯 Need to influence this outcome or find alternative protection strategy

### Scenario D: Alternative Structures (Emerging)
**Status**: Needs exploration with Derek
- Derek as dual VP/CIO
- Virtual CIO (committee model)
- Director-level position instead
- Restructured department reporting

## Current Timeline

**Week of Jan 13-17**: 
- RJ meeting to align on Derek conversation (ASAP)
- Derek conversation on Friday (solo)
- Post-Derek debrief with RJ

**Week of Jan 20-24**: 
- Reassess strategy based on Derek conversation results
- Determine protection strategy for innovation work
- Identify any additional intelligence gathering needed

**Week of Jan 27+**: 
- Execute chosen strategy based on findings
- Monitor Anna's EOI process development
- Stay alert for dark horse candidates or unexpected developments

## Key Quotes from Discovery Process

> "I'm not sure that being a CIO would make me proud outside of the status symbol that comes with it."

> "I would regret leaving the innovation work on the table undone [but] I don't think I would regret not being CIO if I got packaged out."

> "Creating innovative programs [and mentoring] great people and making a real impact on learning" - what would make career feel complete at 65-70

> "In my mind the only viable internal candidate that I could work with would be RJ."

> "Pretty sure a new CIO is going to be a thing within the next 12 months anyway."

From RJ Meeting:
> "Neither R.J. nor I want the CIO role due to the administrative burden, logistical challenges, and the requirement to be Halifax-centered."

> "We estimate Derek's chances for the VP role at about 50-50. If he does not get it, he is likely to leave eventually."
