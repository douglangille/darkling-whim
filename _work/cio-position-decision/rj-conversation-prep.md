## Message Sent to RJ

> "Hey RJ - Been thinking about our conversation about the potential CIO opening if Derek goes for the VP role. Would be good to grab coffee next week and talk through how we're both thinking about the transition. You free Tuesday or Wednesday? Happy to do virtual or in person if you happen to be coming to Truro or Halifax."

## Conversation Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. Gauge his genuine interest in CIO role
2. Understand his perspective on succession
3. Assess whether we'd be competing or collaborating
4. Determine if he'd provide air cover for innovation work

### Intelligence Needed
- Interest level (mental 1-10 scale)
- His view on innovation work importance
- Timeline sense (how fast is this moving?)
- His read on Anna's preferences and likely process
- Whether collaboration or competition dynamic

---

## Conversation Flow

### Opening (Casual Tone)
- "Derek's likely pursuing VP role - seems pretty serious about it"
- "Got me thinking about what happens with CIO succession"
- "Curious about your perspective on all this"

### Key Questions to Explore
1. Have you thought about the CIO opportunity?
2. What appeals to you about it? What doesn't?
3. How are you thinking about your next career move?
4. If you became CIO, what would your priorities be?
5. What do you think happens to innovation/dev work in transition?

### Listen For (Critical Signals)
- Enthusiasm vs. ambivalence about CIO role
- Whether he sees it as natural next step or stretch
- His view on innovation work importance
- Whether he'd value my support or sees me as competitor
- His read on Anna's preferences and likely process
- Timeline indicators

---

## Response Strategies

### If He Clearly Wants CIO Role
**Response Approach:**
- "That makes sense - you'd be great at it"
- "How can I support that?"
- "What would happen to your current role?"
- (Mentally: Position for taking his senior manager role)

**What This Means:**
- Don't compete with him
- Support his candidacy
- Begin positioning for his senior manager role
- This is likely BEST outcome scenario

### If He's Ambivalent
**Response Approach:**
- "What would make it more appealing?"
- "Are there other roles you're considering?"
- "I've been wrestling with it too - duty vs. desire thing"

**What This Means:**
- You may be default internal candidate
- Need to assess if you should pursue
- More conversation needed about mutual interests

### If He Asks About My Interest
**Be Honest But Not Fully Revealing:**
- "Wrestling with it. Part duty, part capstone, part logistics"
- "More interested in protecting innovation work than being CIO"
- "Curious whether there are other paths that make sense"

**Don't Say:**
- Your full analysis from discovery session
- That you don't actually want to BE a CIO
- That you'd prefer his senior manager role
- Strategic details about Angela concerns

---

## Conversation Guardrails

### AVOID:
- Declaring your intentions (you don't have them yet)
- Making it feel like competition
- Asking him not to pursue it
- Revealing all your analysis
- Discussing Angela or other candidates negatively
- Coming across as presumptuous or entitled
- Putting him on defensive

### DO:
- Keep it collegial and collaborative
- Show genuine curiosity about his perspective
- Be honest about your own uncertainty
- Focus on transition and continuity
- Express support regardless of his choice
- Listen more than talk (80/20 rule)

---

## Outcome Assessment

### After Conversation, Rate These (1-10):

**RJ's Interest in CIO**: ___/10  
- 8-10 = He definitely wants it  
- 5-7 = He's seriously considering  
- 1-4 = He's ambivalent or not interested  

**His Support for Innovation Work**: ___/10  
- 8-10 = Would champion it  
- 5-7 = Would maintain it  
- 1-4 = Might deprioritize it  

**Competition vs. Collaboration Dynamic**: ___/10  
- 8-10 = Collaborative, would welcome support  
- 5-7 = Neutral, professional  
- 1-4 = Competitive, sees me as threat  

**Timeline Urgency**: ___/10  
- 8-10 = Moving fast, decisions imminent  
- 5-7 = Few weeks to months  
- 1-4 = Still early, lots of time  

---

## Decision Matrix Post-Conversation

### If RJ Interest = 8-10 AND Innovation Support = 8-10
**DECISION: Support RJ, position for his senior manager role**  
- Best outcome scenario
- Innovation protected under his air cover
- You get better-fit role with growth
- Stay available for Dean/creative opportunities

### If RJ Interest = 1-4 OR Ambivalent
**DECISION: Pursue acting CIO yourself**  
- You become default internal candidate
- Prevents Angela or problematic external hire
- Frame as temporary transition leadership
- Duty/capstone path

### If RJ Interest = 8-10 BUT Innovation Support = 1-4
**DECISION: Pursue CIO yourself (competitive)**  
- Can't let innovation work die under his leadership
- This becomes about protecting the work
- More difficult political dynamic
- Need stronger stakeholder coalition

### If RJ Interest = 5-7 (Considering)
**DECISION: Continue intelligence gathering**  
- Need more data points
- Talk to Derek next
- Assess Anna's preferences
- Reconvene with RJ in 1-2 weeks

## Key Reminders

### Remember:
1. **This is intelligence gathering, not decision making**
2. **RJ's interest level determines your entire strategy**
3. **Best outcome might be him getting CIO, you getting his role**
4. **Keep it collaborative - you may work together regardless**
5. **Listen 80%, talk 20%**
6. **You don't need to decide anything in this conversation**

### Your North Star:
**Protect innovation work and position for mentoring/creative strategy career endgame - with or without being CIO.**
