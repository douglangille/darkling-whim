# Derek Conversation Prep - Friday, January 17, 2026

## Context

**Meeting**: Friday with Derek (RJ not available - collective bargaining)  
**Status**: Derek does NOT know that neither Doug nor RJ wants CIO role  
**Derek's assumption**: Either Doug or RJ will backfill CIO when he moves to VP  
**Critical insight**: Derek's confidence in pursuing VP may depend on CIO succession  

## Pre-Meeting Coordination

**Before Friday**: Meet with RJ to align on approach
- Coordinate key talking points
- Agree on what to surface
- Ensure consistent messaging
- Prepare for candid conversation

## Conversation Objectives

1. Understand Derek's expectations and vision for CIO succession
2. Surface what he actually needs from a CIO successor
3. Gauge his reaction to Doug/RJ not pursuing the role
4. Explore alternative organizational structures he'd support
5. Assess his confidence level and timeline for VP pursuit
6. Protect innovation work priorities in any scenario

## Key Questions to Ask

### Succession Planning
1. **What does he need from his CIO successor to feel confident pursuing VP?**
   - What capabilities are critical?
   - What relationships/trust factors matter?
   - What continuity needs exist?

2. **Has he thought about alternative organizational structures?**
   - Virtual CIO model (committee of senior managers)
   - Derek as dual VP/CIO (broad portfolio)
   - Reversion to Director-level position
   - Different reporting structures

3. **How does he see the department evolving under different scenarios?**
   - If Angela becomes CIO
   - If external candidate hired
   - If neither Doug nor RJ pursues it

### Innovation Work Protection
4. **How does he see innovation work being prioritized and protected?**
   - Under different CIO candidates
   - In alternative org structures
   - In his vision as VP

5. **What's his assessment of front-of-house vs back-of-house balance?**
   - Does he see Angela's infrastructure focus as risk to innovation?
   - How would he ensure learning technology stays prioritized?

### Realistic Assessment
6. **What's his honest take on VP role odds and timeline?**
   - His confidence level in getting the role
   - Stacey Bailey as potential competitor
   - Anna's EOI process scope and timeline

7. **What if neither Doug nor RJ pursues CIO?**
   - Would that change his calculus on pursuing VP?
   - Who else would he trust in the role?
   - Is there a Plan B?

8. **What does he actually want from his VP role?**
   - What would success look like?
   - What parts of CIO work would he miss or keep?
   - How does he see the broader portfolio?

## What to Share (Calibrate with RJ First)

### Doug's Position
- Honored by implied confidence but facing personal/logistical constraints
- One-car household, 45-min commute, RTO requirements
- Passion is innovation work, not executive administration
- Concerned about protecting learning technology priorities
- Open to alternative structures that achieve goals

### Don't Commit To
- Applying for CIO (decision already made: won't)
- Speaking for RJ's intentions (let RJ have his own conversation)
- Supporting specific candidates without more information

### Do Express
- Genuine concern for department continuity
- Commitment to protecting innovation work
- Willingness to help think through alternatives
- Support for Derek's VP pursuit (already documented in endorsement letter)

## Conversation Approach

### Opening
- Natural transition in existing Friday meeting
- "Can we talk about the CIO succession piece?"
- Frame as wanting to understand his vision and needs

### Middle
- Listen more than talk
- Ask clarifying questions
- Surface his assumptions gently
- Explore alternatives collaboratively
- Be honest about personal constraints when relevant

### Closing
- Thank him for candor
- Acknowledge complexity of situation
- Commit to continued dialogue
- Note that RJ will also want to talk with him

## Key Points to Remember

### What Derek Knows
- Doug endorsed him for VP (strong letter dated Jan 8)
- Doug has 26 years at NSCC, deep institutional knowledge
- Doug has been successful in innovation role
- Doug has strong relationship with Anna

### What Derek Doesn't Know
- Doug has decided NOT to pursue CIO under any scenario
- RJ has decided NOT to pursue CIO under any scenario
- Both Doug and RJ have personal/logistical reasons
- RJ might apply "just to see" but would likely decline
- Both are concerned about Angela's front-of-house blindspot

### What Derek Might Be Thinking
- One of his trusted people will step up
- CIO succession is handled/manageable
- He can confidently pursue VP
- The department will be in good hands

### The Reality Check
- Neither trusted person wants the role
- This could affect his VP decision
- Alternative structures may be needed
- Innovation work protection needs active planning

## Alternative Structures to Explore

### Option 1: Derek as Dual VP/CIO
**Pros**: Maintains his control, protects priorities, known quantity  
**Cons**: Very broad portfolio, sustainability questions  
**Ask**: Would he consider this? Has Anna mentioned it?

### Option 2: Virtual CIO Model
**Pros**: Distributed leadership, leverages senior managers  
**Cons**: Accountability questions, coordination complexity  
**Ask**: Has this been discussed? What would structure look like?

### Option 3: Director-Level Instead
**Pros**: Right-sizing for actual scope, easier to fill  
**Cons**: Reduced executive presence, potential status/budget impact  
**Ask**: Would this be acceptable to him? To Anna?

### Option 4: Restructured Reporting
**Pros**: Could separate front/back of house explicitly  
**Cons**: Org chart complexity, relationship disruption  
**Ask**: Has he thought about different reporting structures?

### Option 5: External Hire with Strong Innovation Mandate
**Pros**: Fresh perspective, explicit priority setting  
**Cons**: Unknown variable, learning curve, culture fit risk  
**Ask**: What would he want to see in external candidate profile?

## Post-Conversation Actions

### Immediate (After Meeting)
- Document key insights while fresh
- Note Derek's reactions and body language
- Capture any unexpected information
- Identify any commitments made

### Short-Term (Weekend)
- Debrief with RJ on what Derek said
- Compare notes if RJ has also talked to Derek
- Reassess strategy based on new information
- Update GitHub files with findings

### Next Steps
- Determine if additional Derek conversations needed
- Identify other stakeholders to consult
- Monitor Anna's EOI process development
- Stay alert for unexpected developments

## Potential Outcomes

### Best Case
- Derek reveals alternative structure already in planning
- Innovation work protection explicitly addressed
- Doug's non-pursuit doesn't derail Derek's plans
- Clear path forward emerges

### Neutral Case
- Derek surprised but understanding
- Needs time to think through implications
- Opens dialogue about alternatives
- No immediate resolution but productive conversation

### Challenging Case
- Derek disappointed or concerned
- Questions whether to pursue VP
- No clear alternatives emerge
- Creates pressure to reconsider

### Prepare For
- Direct ask: "Will you apply for CIO?"
- Emotional reaction (disappointment, concern)
- Counter-arguments about why Doug should do it
- Request to reconsider

### Stand Firm On
- Personal/logistical constraints are real
- Decision is thoughtful, not impulsive
- Willingness to help find solutions
- Commitment to innovation work protection

## Innovation Work Specifics to Protect

Be ready to articulate what's at risk:

- **Classroom Technology**: D2L Brightspace, learning spaces, instructional tech
- **AI Integration**: Productivity tools, AI tinkerspaces, emerging tech adoption
- **Learning Innovation**: Makerspaces, esports, experiential learning tech
- **Training & Development**: Faculty/staff tech skill building, change management
- **Front-of-House Priority**: Student-facing technology vs infrastructure-only focus

**The Risk**: Back-of-house leaders (like Angela) may not understand or prioritize these learning experience initiatives.
